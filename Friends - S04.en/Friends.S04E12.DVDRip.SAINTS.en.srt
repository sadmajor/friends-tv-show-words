1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,539
What the hell is that?!

2
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:22,421
What the hell is that?
Is that you?

3
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,593
-You're really not a morning person.
-Just back off!

4
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,102
Get up! Get up! Get up!

5
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,603
What is that noise?

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,209
You!

7
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,707
It's the chick.

8
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,145
She's going through some changes.

9
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,720
What kind of changes?

10
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,980
The vet seems to think...

11
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,489
...she's becoming a rooster.

12
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,224
We're getting a second opinion.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,191
The One With the Embryos

14
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,740
Why are you shopping
at 8 in the morning?

15
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,476
I've been up since 6...

16
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,315
...thanks to somebody's
dumb-ass rooster.

17
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,286
You should get rid of those animals.
They shouldn't be in an apartment.

18
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,894
Especially not with these
knives and cookbooks around.

19
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,934
I'm going to the doctor
and see if I'm ready...

20
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,437
...to have Frank and Alice's embryo
transferred into my uterus.

21
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,436
How will they know?

22
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,977
They'll just see if my
endometrial layer is thick.

23
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,741
I can check that for you.

24
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,950
Okay, think "thick."

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,946
Good luck!

26
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,445
Wish me luck.

27
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,248
Good luck.

28
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,758
-I'm still right.
-That is so not true.

29
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,088
What?

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,696
I know it's her laundry day...

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,563
...and that means she's wearing
her old-lady underpants.

32
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,929
I can check that for you.

33
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,541
You two think you know
me and Rachel...

34
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,472
...better than we know you.

35
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,475
Well, we do.

36
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,951
You can only eat Tic Tacs
in even numbers.

37
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,117
What's that about?

38
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,814
And you!
Ross, if you check Rachel's bag...

39
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,891
...you'll find a half-eaten box
of cookies in there.

40
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,659
You're good.

41
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,764
These are not.

42
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,728
I'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.

43
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,933
Ross, how many items
left in that bag?

44
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,133
Five.

45
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:37,108
Okay, 10 bucks says we can
name every item in that bag.

46
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,409
-How many guesses?
-Six.

47
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,212
Challenge extended.

48
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,719
-Deal!
-Challenge accepted.

49
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,554
All right, we'll start with...

50
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,386
...apples.

51
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,657
We'll be starting with apples.

52
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,704
Stop that now.

53
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,663
Yes.

54
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,206
Okay. Tortilla chips.

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,935
-Yogurt.
-Diet soda.

56
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,984
-Orange juice.
-There's no orange juice! We win!

57
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,318
They have another guess.

58
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,155
Well, we won that one.

59
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,421
Okay. The last thing is

60
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,297
Not for another two weeks.

61
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,563
I got it.

62
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:35,935
Scotch...

63
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,133
...tape.

64
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,240
How did you know
she would buy Scotch tape?

65
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,386
We used up theirs last night
making scary faces.

66
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,217
Oh, man!

67
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,052
All right! Ten bucks.
Fork it over.

68
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,262
Cough it up. Pay the piper.

69
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,157
Give me it!

70
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,062
You don't know us better.
I want a rematch.

71
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,567
And no stupid grocery questions.
Real, personal questions.

72
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,330
And the winner gets $100.

73
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:13,369
-Serious?
-Are you scared?

74
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,907
No.

75
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,415
Who makes up the questions?

76
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,846
Ross will do it.

77
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,782
Sure, Ross will do it.

78
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,083
It's not like he has a job
or a child or a life of his own.

79
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,627
-Fine. We'll ask Phoebe.
-No, I want to play.

80
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,071
Looks like your uterus
is ready for implantation.

81
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,800
I knew it!
I felt really thick this morning.

82
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:48,236
Okay, so what's now?
Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

83
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,813
It'll take a little while
to prepare the embryos.

84
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:56,020
-Embryos? As in more than one?
-Five, actually.

85
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,347
Where am I giving birth...

86
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,356
...in a hospital or
a big box under the stairs?

87
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:06,290
Doing five gives you a 25% chance
that at least one will attach.

88
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,397
That's it? 25%?

89
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,400
That means that it's, like,
75% chance of no baby at all?

90
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,800
I was thinking,
what are the odds...

91
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,601
...if you stuff 200 of them in there?

92
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,509
Sweetie, now...

93
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,647
...she's a woman,
not a gumball machine.

94
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:31,221
Don't worry. I'll do this as many
times as it takes to get it right.

95
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,983
The thing is, we kind of
only have one shot.

96
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,231
It costs $16,000 each time you do this.

97
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,056
Sixteen thousand dollars?!

98
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:46,228
Well, it's 20 in California.

99
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:51,542
We're kind of using all the money
we have to do it this one time.

100
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,709
Okay, that's a lot of
pressure on me and my uterus.

101
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:04,187
Maybe there's something I can do
to make sure I get pregnant.

102
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,755
No, I'm sorry.

103
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,619
Wow, you guys really
don't know anything.

104
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:14,863
Why don't you get drunk? It worked
for a bunch of girls in my high school.

105
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:26,204
-So how's the test coming?
-Hey, you're touching the game board.

106
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,607
Sorry.

107
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,909
You freak.

108
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,779
Do you realize that
any minute now...

109
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,479
...Phoebe could be pregnant?

110
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,783
I know, I know.

111
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,893
It's such a huge,
life-altering thing.

112
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,626
The test is ready.

113
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,495
Okay. Each team will
answer 10 questions.

114
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:58,608
The first team to answer
the most questions wins.

115
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,303
The categories are
"Fears and Pet Peeves"...

116
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,243
..."Ancient History"...

117
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,008
..."Literature"...

118
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,583
...and "It's all Relative."

119
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,416
Now...

120
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,183
...the coin toss,
to see who goes first.

121
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,800
Okay.

122
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,268
Somebody call it this time.

123
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:28,933
Tails!

124
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,804
It's heads.

125
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,112
Gentlemen, pick your category.

126
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,315
"Fears and Pet Peeves."

127
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,345
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"

128
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,484
-Animals dressed as humans.
-Correct.

129
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,584
-Ladies?
-Same category.

130
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,024
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon
scares the bejesus out of him?"

131
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,232
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!

132
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,765
That is correct.

133
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,743
The Irish jig guy?

134
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:11,076
His legs flail about
as if independent from his body!

135
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,051
Gentlemen, your pick.

136
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,618
"It's all Relative."

137
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,116
"Monica and I had
a grandmother who died.

138
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,451
You both went to her funeral.

139
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,054
Name that grandmother."

140
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,660
-Nana?
-She has a real name.

141
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,395
Althea!

142
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,935
-What?
-I took a shot!

143
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,128
With Althea?

144
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,841
-Althea is correct.
-Nice shooting!

145
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,741
"Literature."

146
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:47,045
"Every week the TV Guide comes
to Chandler and Joey's apartment.

147
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,347
What name appears
on the address label?"

148
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,525
Chandler gets it!
It's Chandler Bing!

149
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:58,357
I'm afraid the TV Guide
comes to "Chanandler Bong."

150
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,901
I knew that!

151
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,070
Rachel, use your head!

152
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,234
Actually, it's Ms. Chanandler Bong.

153
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,177
Hello, teeny embryos.

154
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,946
I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi!

155
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,560
I'm hoping to be your uterus
for the next nine months.

156
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,723
We're doing this
for Frank and Alice...

157
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,398
...who you know.
You've been there.

158
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,230
They want you so much.

159
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,135
So when you guys get in there,
really grab on.

160
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:47,041
And I promise that I'll keep you
safe and warm...

161
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,443
...until you're ready
to have them take you home.

162
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,250
Next time you see me,
if I'm screaming, don't worry.

163
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,756
That's what's supposed to happen.

164
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,889
Ready?

165
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,560
Good luck!

166
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,068
The score is nine to eight
in favor of the guys.

167
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,935
Ladies, if you miss this,
the game is theirs. Pick a category.

168
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,804
"It's all Relative"!

169
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,741
-You don't have to shout everything.
-I'm sorry!

170
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,319
"What is the name
of Chandler's father's...

171
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,490
...Las Vegas all-male burlesque?"

172
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,751
Viva Las Gaygas!

173
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,924
Unfortunately, that is correct.

174
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,496
All right. We have a tie.

175
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,698
Luckily, I've prepared
for such an event.

176
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,834
The lightning round!

177
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,743
Thirty seconds.
All the questions you can answer.

178
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,850
You guys are dead!

179
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,488
I am so good at lightning rounds!

180
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,885
I majored in lightning rounds,
all right?

181
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,357
We'll destroy you.

182
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,552
Want to bet?

183
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,397
I'm so confused as to what
we've been doing so far.

184
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,896
How about we play for more money?
Say 150?

185
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,007
One hundred and fifty dollars.

186
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,344
Say 200?

187
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,911
Two hundred dollars!

188
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,576
You're doing it again.

189
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,512
Excuse me.

190
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,847
-I don't want to lose $200.
-We won't.

191
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,455
Three hundred?

192
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,556
I'm spicing it up!

193
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,127
So play for some pepper!
Stop spending my money.

194
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,620
I got it!

195
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,390
If we win, they have to
get rid of the rooster.

196
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,400
That's interesting!

197
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,639
-No way! That rooster's family.
-The duck too!

198
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,866
The duck doesn't make noise!

199
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,341
He gets the other one all riled up!

200
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,508
-We are not
-All right, hold on!

201
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,679
If you win...

202
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,713
...we give up the bird.

203
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,290
But if we win...

204
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,258
...we get your apartment.

205
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,463
-Deal!
-What?

206
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:27,730
That's crazy. There's no way
we are betting the apartment.

207
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:35,844
All right, I'm in. Because either
he goes, or I'm buying a coyote.

208
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,590
Betting the apartment?
I don't know about this.

209
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,397
I have not missed one question
the whole game. I own this game!

210
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,025
-Look at my hand.
-You have the answers written there?

211
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,502
No. Steady as a rock.
Now, are you with me?

212
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,367
All right, let's do it!

213
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,504
All right.
Gentlemen, you're up first.

214
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,375
You have 30 seconds.

215
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,547
The lightning round begins

216
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,221
Stop it!

217
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,285
"Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?"

218
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,291
-Big Fat Goalie.
-Correct!

219
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,399
"Rachel claims
it's her favorite movie."

220
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:30,999
Dangerous Liaisons.

221
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,931
-"Her actual favorite is...?"
-Weekend at Bernie's.

222
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:40,342
"In what part of her body did Monica
get a pencil stuck at age 14?"

223
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,578
No!

224
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,078
Her ear!

225
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:56,454
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

226
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,887
-Everyday use.
-Fancy.

227
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,530
-Guest.
-Fancy guest.

228
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,734
-Two seconds.
-Eleven?

229
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,029
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct!

230
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,163
All right.

231
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,640
That's four for the guys.
Ladies, you're up!

232
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,475
Thirty seconds on the clock.

233
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,280
Five correct questions
wins the game.

234
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,090
The lightning round begins now.
"Joey's favorite food?"

235
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,726
-Sandwiches!
-Correct.

236
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,394
"Chandler was how old when he
first touched a girl's breast?"

237
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,961
-14?
-No, 19.

238
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,291
Thanks, man.

239
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,400
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

240
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,069
-His name was...?"
-Maurice!

241
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,331
-"His profession was...?"
-Space cowboy!

242
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,734
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

243
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,212
It has something to do with numbers!

244
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,579
-And processing!
-He carries a briefcase.

245
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,186
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

246
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,584
Something to do
with transponding.

247
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,224
He's a transponster!

248
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,261
That's not even a word!

249
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,425
I can get this! I can get this!

250
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,746
-I call Monica's room.
-You can't just call Monica's room.

251
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,991
Sure I can.
Standard shotgun rules.

252
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,660
I'm in sight of the room
and I called it.

253
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,190
Damn!

254
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,495
I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

255
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,871
Guess the color of my tonsils.
I bet the apartment!

256
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,666
I would never bet this place.
It's too nice.

257
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,438
Are they in there?

258
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,443
Yeah, I'm implanted.

259
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,713
-How do you feel?
-Well, freaked.

260
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,016
It turns out the odds
are really sucky.

261
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,883
And this is
Frank and Alice's only shot.

262
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,628
They are literally putting
all their eggs in my basket.

263
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:13,892
But I bet it works.

264
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,292
Really? How much?

265
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,899
I'm going to take
a pregnancy test now.

266
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,040
Wow! You can tell this soon?

267
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,506
The doctor says it takes a few days.

268
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,838
But my body's always been a little
faster than Western medicine.

269
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:37,086
I can't believe you guys think
you're moving in here.

270
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,482
Well, believe it, baby!

271
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,654
-Well, I'm not moving.
-What?

272
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,255
No. It was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.

273
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,594
You can't ignore the bet.
It's a bet!

274
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,669
Bet on a bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet.

275
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,998
We have to move.

276
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,574
We would have made them
get rid of the birds.

277
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:07,676
I hate this as much as you,
but if it makes you feel better...

278
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,148
...this is all your fault.

279
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,312
What?

280
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,257
Chanandler Bong!
We steal that TV Guide every week!

281
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,487
I knew it!

282
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,695
I don't care.
I'm not going anywhere.

283
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,129
Cool! Girl roommate.

284
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,795
Well?

285
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,638
Nope, not knocked up yet.

286
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,136
It's only been a couple hours.

287
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,179
Meanwhile, I'll do
whatever I can to help this.

288
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,841
I'm just going to, you know,
lie in your chair, okay?

289
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,820
Good. I'm going
to let gravity do its job.

290
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,758
I won't get in the way.

291
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:54,161
It'll be just like that time I tried to
count all the bumps on your ceiling.

292
00:18:55,334 --> 00:19:00,499
You know, Pheebs, if you sit there long
enough, you'll be sitting in our apartment.

293
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,162
I can't believe this.

294
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,767
Oh, Rach, FYl: Your new apartment
hasn't had hot water since Christmas.

295
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,076
Can you give me a hand?

296
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,810
Put that box down!
We are not going anywhere!

297
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,821
This is my apartment and I like it!

298
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,187
This is a girl's apartment!

299
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:27,762
That is a boy's apartment!
It's dirty and it smells!

300
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,867
This is pretty!
It's so pretty!

301
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,366
And look, it's purple!

302
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,972
I tell you, you with your
steady hand, I am not moving.

303
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,269
And now I have got the steady hand.

304
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,142
Okay, okay.

305
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,284
-I'll take care of it.
-That's right.

306
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,386
You do what the hand says!

307
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,796
-How'd it go?
-I lost our mattresses.

308
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,938
Are you in there, little fetus?
In nine months will you come greet us?

309
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,011
I will buy you some Adidas

310
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:32,325
We were just at the drugstore
so we got you a little present.

311
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,862
That's where all my blood was.

312
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,960
It's a lollipop
and a home pregnancy test.

313
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,399
Don't mix those up.
You could really ruin that lollipop.

314
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:53,143
You feel like taking a test?
There's only one question.

315
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,421
All right. I will.

316
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,248
Remember that
it's still really early.

317
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:05,394
If it says I'm not pregnant, that
doesn't mean I won't get pregnant.

318
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,395
Just so I don't go completely nuts...

319
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,364
...try not to put
all your hopes on this.

320
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,663
Great.

321
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,016
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!

322
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,485
Don't get mad! No one
forced you to raise the stakes.

323
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,182
That is not true!
She forced me!

324
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,952
You got the question wrong.

325
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,460
It was a stupid, unfair question!

326
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,293
Don't blame the questions!

327
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:46,835
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.

328
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,734
-Stop calling it your apartment!
-It is!

329
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:56,143
You're going to have a baby.
They're going to have a baby!

330
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,852
My sister's going to have my baby!

331
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,525
Okay, but this can't
be good for the baby.

332
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,473
I can't find garbage bags.

333
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,877
I think I saw some in here.

334
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,282
What is it?

335
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,895
I don't know. But maybe if we keep
that drawer shut, it'll die.

336
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,231
I can't believe we're living here!

337
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,100
What is it?

338
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,866
Did you see the size of the closets?

339
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,105
I can't believe we live here!
