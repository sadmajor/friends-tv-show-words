1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,733
It's me. I know you
can't stand to see me.

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,500
I'm trying to apologize
over the phone

3
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,987
I shouldn't have kissed
your girlfriend

4
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,019
Stop calling!

5
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:31,357
This is 92.3 WXRK, K-Rock...

6
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,089
...calling with our $ 1000
daily challenge!

7
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,561
All right!

8
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,895
What is the name of...

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,334
...your roommate who is very sorry
and would do anything?

10
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:50,382
-Damn it, Chandler, stop calling.
-Joey, it's Ross.

11
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,709
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

12
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:52,943
What's up?

13
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:59,047
Not much. I got Chandler
here and he's really, really sorry

14
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,684
The One with Chandler in a Box

15
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,039
Oh, turkey!

16
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,970
Giving thanks!

17
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,745
Look, everyone.
It's the spirit of Thanksgiving!

18
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,206
Are things with Joey better?

19
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,180
They couldn't be worse.
I spent eight hours calling him...

20
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,320
...trying to get him
to talk to me.

21
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,115
Eight hours.

22
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:09,089
You could probably use
a plug-in telephone headset.

23
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,663
Should we all expect Christmas gifts
that are stolen from your office?

24
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,361
You shouldn't.

25
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,533
Speaking of Christmas...

26
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,675
Since Monica and I are starting
a new business and have no money...

27
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:29,540
...this year we could do Secret Santa
and each only buy one gift.

28
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,013
And there's the added mystery
of who gets who.

29
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,285
Who gets whom.

30
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,516
I don't know why I do that.

31
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,992
But it is correct.

32
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,191
Hey, what's this?
It's all of your names.

33
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,461
Let's pick.

34
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,066
Hey, what's going?

35
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,039
-No, Joey, stay.
-We're picking names for Secret Santa.

36
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,181
Okay.

37
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,448
I invented Secret Santa, you know.

38
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,787
What are you laughing at? You're the
one who said Die Hard was your idea.

39
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,187
It was.

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,361
Don't make me show you the napkin.

41
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,563
I'm going to take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.

42
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,633
We haven't eaten yet.

43
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:33,745
I know, but all that work
you're doing to get it ready and...

44
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,315
Did you pick Rachel for your
Secret Santa? I'll trade for her.

45
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,086
I picked her.
Thank God, you want her!

46
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,721
Why do you want to get
rid of her so badly?

47
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,859
She exchanges every gift she gets.

48
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,494
It's impossible to get her
something she likes.

49
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,221
Come on, let's trade!

50
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,194
I got her that backpack
and she loved it.

51
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,268
I remember she cried
when that big dog ran off with

52
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,238
There was no big dog.

53
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:09,277
This sucks! I already got her
a briefcase with "R.G." put on it.

54
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,047
Her initials.

55
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,411
Okay, I'm really bad at initials.

56
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,953
You got your shopping done early.

57
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,721
Yeah, well, my Camel Cash
was about to expire.

58
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,188
Maybe you can give it to somebody
else. Like Ross Geller!

59
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,365
You know what?
It's a girlie briefcase.

60
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,101
Who cares!
He works in a museum.

61
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,635
The big game's about to start!

62
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,006
Ross and Joey aren't here.
You can watch the parade if you want.

63
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,908
Thanks.

64
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,075
What is wrong with this freezer?

65
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,153
-What happened?
-Ice just got in my eye!

66
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,815
People are trying
to sleep in here!

67
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,957
Monica got ice in her eye
and it hurts!

68
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,129
-Open it up. Let me see.
-I can't. It really kills.

69
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,958
Maybe you should put
some ice on it.

70
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,497
-It looks bad.
-We should take you to a doctor.

71
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,567
No, my eye doctor is Richard!

72
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,638
I can't go to him
when I don't have a boyfriend.

73
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,543
He's really picky about his patients.

74
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,704
You've got to go.
What's his office number?

75
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,583
Like I remember his office number!

76
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,276
Speed dial seven.

77
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,925
I'm calling on behalf
of Monica Geller's eye.

78
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,023
Is Richard Burke in today?

79
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,962
He's not in. Will she
see the on-call doctor?

80
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,465
-Yes.
-She's very excited about that!

81
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,035
Okay, we'll be right in.

82
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,141
Okay, so who's gonna take her in?

83
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,300
I'll go, you can watch your parade.

84
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,680
It's so cool.
Till Monica gets back, I'm head chef.

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,411
And I get to make all the decisions.

86
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,257
She told you to follow
the recipe exactly.

87
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,221
Get out of my kitchen.

88
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,899
I think I'm making
some progress with Joey.

89
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,660
When I walked in,
he went to his bedroom...

90
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,871
...but he only slammed the door once.

91
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,803
Yeah, he gave me the finger
while doing it.

92
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:21,303
I've got to call my mom and
ask her a left-handed cooking question.

93
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,246
I'm gonna be in there.

94
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,782
While I'm gone...

95
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,020
Chandler, you're in charge.

96
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:40,455
I picked Monica for Secret Santa, but
I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.

97
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,394
You want to switch?

98
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,200
I was trying to trade...

99
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,462
...for you.

100
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,742
Really? That's so nice.
What are you getting me?

101
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:56,745
I don't know, R.G. I was thinking
something girlie for your office.

102
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,481
Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.

103
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:05,053
Then you'll get stuck with Rachel,
and she exchanges every gift.

104
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,124
No, I got her lots of stuff
she never took back.

105
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,383
Like?

106
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,120
Like that gold necklace
I got her last year.

107
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,730
When did she wear it last?

108
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:18,169
She wore it all Christmas day
and then...

109
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,431
Big dog?

110
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,571
What are you doing?

111
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,306
Sending back this stuff
Chandler bought.

112
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,613
-Even the TV?
-No, I'll put that in my room.

113
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:41,452
Listen, Joey.
I know what he did was wrong.

114
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,423
But can't you hear him out?

115
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,659
If Chandler had kissed Rachel,
would you hear him out?

116
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,125
That's a good point.

117
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,502
How long you going to punish him?

118
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,297
Five years.

119
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,498
You've sentenced him?

120
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,743
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

121
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,908
The guy's your best friend.

122
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,013
Was my best friend.

123
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,186
I don't know why
you're pushing for him.

124
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,049
With him out of the way as
my best friend, there's a spot open.

125
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,951
-Who, me?
-Yeah.

126
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,932
I'm honored. You know what
I'm going to do as your best friend?

127
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,700
I'm going to get you
to talk to Chandler.

128
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,029
All right.

129
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,937
But if you weren't
my best friend...

130
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,578
Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?

131
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,042
I walk in the room,
and he won't talk to me.

132
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,219
He just mumbles something in Italian.

133
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,117
And I know he only knows
the bad words.

134
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,587
I'm so, so sorry.
I feel responsible.

135
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,890
It's not your fault.

136
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,367
-Gunther, have you seen Chandler?
-I thought you were Chandler.

137
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,071
But one of you is over there.

138
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,749
Hey, Joe.

139
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,761
I'll be right with you.
Thanks for coming in.

140
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,963
Oh, my God!
How cute is the on-call doctor?

141
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:36,339
So cute that I'm thinking
about jamming this pen in my eye.

142
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,984
-You have the best luck with eye doctors.
-I know.

143
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,022
Dr. Burke will see you now.

144
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,922
Not Dr. Burke.
The on-call doctor will see me now.

145
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,592
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

146
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:02,095
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,
will see you now.

147
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,431
Ready?

148
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,302
Hey, I'm sorry. That

149
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,477
-Where you going?
-My folks'.

150
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,977
When you coming back?

151
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:26,658
I don't know. I might stay there
while I look for an apartment.

152
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,649
What?

153
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:33,529
I thought we could talk
about this. Work it out.

154
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,724
Seeing you two together, I don't...

155
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,233
What do you want me to say?
Should I stop seeing her?

156
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,963
It's not about her. Okay?

157
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,677
But seeing you together
reminds me of what you did.

158
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,472
I won't live with someone who doesn't
know what it is to be a friend.

159
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,811
I know what it is to be a friend.
I screwed up.

160
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,544
Yeah, you did.

161
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,547
And that's why I'm leaving.

162
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,987
If you're not going to stay for me,
then at least stay for them.

163
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,895
They had a very difficult year.
What with the robbery and all.

164
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,330
And that chick used to be very cute.

165
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,064
When that guy was robbing us...

166
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,107
...and I was locked in the
entertainment unit for six hours...

167
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,905
...do you know what I was doing?

168
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,670
I was thinking about
how I let you down.

169
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:29,179
If I knew what kind of friend
you'd be, I wouldn't have worried.

170
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:34,453
Wait one second! There has
to be something that I can do.

171
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,059
If we still had that unit...

172
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,995
...I'd get in it for six hours
and think about how I let you down.

173
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,694
What?

174
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,600
We got a box.

175
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,976
I remember the last time I saw you.

176
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,511
It was the morning I left for college.

177
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,818
You were standing
outside the Dairy Queen.

178
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,717
Just probably waiting for it to open.

179
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,183
-You look great now.
-You look great too.

180
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,653
You're an excellent patient.

181
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,721
How does it look?

182
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,062
You have a scratch on your cornea.
You have to wear a patch.

183
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,065
Like a pirate?

184
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,535
If that helps you.

185
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,848
How long have you been working
with your dad?

186
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,146
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

187
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,477
I moved back here a couple months ago.

188
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,990
Big family dinner tonight?

189
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,720
No way!

190
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,556
I was gonna have Thanksgiving
at my girlfriend's.

191
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,389
But we broke up.

192
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,599
She wasn't ready
for a serious commitment.

193
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,143
So you made her walk the plank,
aye, matey?

194
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,835
You're not wearing the patch yet.

195
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,943
I know.

196
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,649
-He's coming here for Thanksgiving?
-I know. It's sick.

197
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,689
-Why is it sick?
-It's Richard's son!

198
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,799
It's like inviting
a Greek tragedy over for dinner.

199
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,499
If it were Greek,
I'd be blind in both eyes.

200
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:30,942
I like him because he's handsome and
he's nice and smart and handsome.

201
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,046
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

202
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,410
I could see where I'd be
your best shot, but no.

203
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,147
Sorry, honey. I think it's twisted.

204
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,151
-What's twisted?
-Me going out with Richard's son.

205
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,155
It sounds like a really bad idea to me.

206
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,835
-Is he okay in there?
-He's fine!

207
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,237
If things work out
between you and Richard's son...

208
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,069
...you can tell your kids...

209
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,768
...that you slept
with their grandfather.

210
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,013
Judge all you want to.

211
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,581
Married a lesbian,
left a man at the altar...

212
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,320
...loved a gay ice dancer...

213
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,581
...threw a girl's wooden leg
in the fire, live in a box!

214
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,624
What exactly is the point of the box?

215
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,997
The meaning of the box is threefold.

216
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,634
One, it gives me the time
to think about what I did.

217
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:43,778
Two, it proves how much I care
about my friendship with Joey.

218
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,940
And three...

219
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,281
...it hurts.

220
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,883
And if he stays in the box
you guys will be friends again?

221
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,853
Let's just say it's a start.

222
00:14:56,328 --> 00:15:00,492
Remember that necklace
I gave you last year?

223
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,327
Can I see it?

224
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,399
Why?

225
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,932
I just want to check something.

226
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,840
Okay.

227
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,577
Now we'll see.

228
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,303
Air hole! Air hole!

229
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,313
Here it is. I love it.
I wear it all the time.

230
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,853
The necklace I got you was gold.
This is silver.

231
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,529
Well, maybe...

232
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,931
...it changed.

233
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,599
Oh, my God!
You actually exchanged it.

234
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,000
Isn't it better to exchange it
for something I enjoy...

235
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,538
...and can use a lot?

236
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,501
What did you get?

237
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,338
Credit.

238
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,418
I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.
I'll get it. I'll get it.

239
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,384
Hi, Tim.

240
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:02,087
Thank you.
Come meet my friends.

241
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,987
Phoebe.

242
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,492
And Joey.

243
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,324
My brother, Ross.

244
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,158
And Rachel.

245
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,605
That's Chandler.

246
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,307
How do you do?

247
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,507
-What's?
-Well, he's...

248
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,976
He's doing some thinking.

249
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,480
-What happened?
-You kissed my girlfriend!

250
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,423
I like those sunglasses.

251
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:43,128
"Like them" like them? Or "I'd like
to get store credit" like them?

252
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,935
This turkey is ready.

253
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,107
Where can I wash up?

254
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,142
Let me show you.

255
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,378
The towels are hanging next
to the sink.

256
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,618
-And you can use the fancy soap.
-Thank you.

257
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,450
Fancy soap? I thought we were
saving that for the pope.

258
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,555
See. He's nice, right?

259
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,923
Do you want a relationship
where you can actually say:

260
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,827
"That's not how your dad
used to do it"?

261
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,134
Everything looks great.
Where should I sit?

262
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,331
Saved you a seat.

263
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,309
Sick, sick, sick, sick.

264
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,105
I'll get it.

265
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,111
Got you!

266
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,112
That doesn't sound
like thinking to me.

267
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,926
-Sorry!
-You shouldn't be talking at all.

268
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,290
You've got too much thinking to do
to be talking and joking.

269
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,292
Okay, you got it!

270
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,262
Ross, pass me the yams?

271
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:54,098
Joey's got the mashed potatoes
if you want to exchange them.

272
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,173
Will you stop!
What's the matter with you?

273
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,043
We've got company.

274
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,280
Nothing's the matter with me.

275
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:10,445
I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
I have feelings.

276
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,486
Okay, fine.

277
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:23,263
You can't tell, but I'm breaking
the tension by mooning you guys.

278
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,803
All right, look!

279
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,976
If this is a big joke to you,
forget about it.

280
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,204
This means something to me.

281
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,350
If it doesn't mean anything to you,
then get out of there.

282
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,781
Otherwise, you're just
an idiot in a box.

283
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,584
You're right. I'm sorry.
This means a lot to me.

284
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,125
I want to be friends again.
I swear I won't say another word.

285
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,659
-So you'll take this seriously?
-Absolutely!

286
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,229
That sounds like another word to me.

287
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,500
Are you going to take this seriously?

288
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,942
Okay!

289
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,913
Don't say that I have no sentiment.

290
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,818
This is a movie stub
from our first date.

291
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,988
This eggshell is from the first time
you made me breakfast in bed.

292
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,720
This is from the museum,
the first time we...

293
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,428
...were together.

294
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,233
Maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter.

295
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,835
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:38,900
Though you're not
supposed to take these.

297
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,448
It's, like, a million years old.

298
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,784
We actually have people
looking for that.

299
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,021
-Mind if I smoke?
-Care if I die?

300
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,930
No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
Go ahead, smoke.

301
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,626
This always happens.

302
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,670
Here, let me.

303
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,729
Thank you.

304
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,245
You have very beautiful...

305
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,672
...eye.

306
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,279
My friends think this is weird.

307
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,319
Even the one in the box?

308
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,349
It's not weird, is it?

309
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,051
I thought it would be. I almost
canceled, but it really isn't.

310
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,963
I know. Me and your dad,
that's totally separate.

311
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,167
I totally agree.

312
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,460
We're two people
who find each other...

313
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,806
...very attractive.

314
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,497
Right?

315
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,479
-What?
-Nothing, nothing.

316
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,519
No, really.
Was that not okay?

317
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,021
No, that was good.

318
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,752
That was a good kiss.

319
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,161
-It reminded you of
-Don't say it!

320
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,993
-It did, didn't it?
-Yes!

321
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,533
I know!

322
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,971
God, I am sorry. I am so sorry.

323
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:26,141
It's okay. It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without a little emotional scarring.

324
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,078
You know what's even worse?

325
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,745
My friends were right.

326
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:36,850
You know what's worst for me is you remind
me of a younger version of my mom.

327
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,811
-I want you to know how sorry I am
-It's okay.

328
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:07,549
-Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
-Well, I'm still sorry.

329
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,393
-Is he here?
-In the box.

330
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,063
He can't talk right now.

331
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,432
Why not? What's going on?

332
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,575
He's trying to show Joey
how much he means to him.

333
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,842
-By being in a box?
-Joey had reasons.

334
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,816
They were threefold.

335
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,687
You not being able to talk
might make this easier.

336
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,831
Listen...

337
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:02,846
I don't want to be someone
who comes between two best friends.

338
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,844
I can't stand seeing
what this is doing to you guys.

339
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,050
And I don't want to be
the cause of that.

340
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,555
I don't think we can see
each other anymore.

341
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,126
I'm going to my mom's in Chicago.

342
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,964
I'm going to stay there for a while.

343
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,768
I think this could have been
something really amazing.

344
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:34,105
But, you know, this is
probably for the best.

345
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,609
You know?

346
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,216
I'm going to miss you.

347
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,315
Goodbye, Chandler.

348
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,962
Open the box!

349
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,828
What?

350
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:06,467
He can still catch her.
Get out of there! Get out of there!

351
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:12,080
We're going to be fine.
Get out!

352
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,386
You did some real good
thinking in there.

353
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,820
I mean, this is...

354
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,257
You could still catch her!

355
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,359
And merry Christmas
from your Secret Santa!

356
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,732
All right, who got Chandler?
Because I need to trade.

357
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,472
He sees her!

358
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,240
He's catching up to her.

359
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,877
She sees him!

360
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,180
They're hugging!

361
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,386
He's taking her purse.

362
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,324
That's not them.

363
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,361
I'll go call the police.

364
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,001
There they are!

365
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,735
All right, get a room.
