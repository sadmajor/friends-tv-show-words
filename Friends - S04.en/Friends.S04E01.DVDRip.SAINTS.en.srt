1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,726
Phoebe found out about this lady...

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:09,034
...who knew her parents,
and I don't know what happened.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,901
I'm your mother.

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,772
Monica joked she
wouldn't date Chandler.

5
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:17,882
I don't know what
happened there either.

6
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,314
Ross' new girlfriend shows up.

7
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:24,455
Rachel gets Bonnie to shave her head.
Then they kiss.

8
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,820
Now he has to choose
Rachel or the bald girl.

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,254
I don't know what
happened there either.

10
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,931
Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.

11
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,611
She's helping me.
My head's sunburned.

12
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,821
-Thanks a million.
-You're welcome a million.

13
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,993
Smell it.

14
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,621
Minty.

15
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,059
I'll be in our room.

16
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,677
Oh, my God!

17
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,374
I know.

18
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,521
I got to go.

19
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,054
I got to go break up with Bonnie.

20
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,221
Here? Now?

21
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,296
I can't stay here all night.

22
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,400
If I go in there, she'll want to...

23
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,093
...do stuff.

24
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,002
Can't you say
you aren't in the mood?

25
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,665
No, she likes that.

26
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,374
Faking sleep doesn't work.

27
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,207
I've woken up many times with her

28
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,055
-Why am I telling you?
-I don't know.

29
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,291
-Not every morning
-Making it worse!

30
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,669
The One with the Jellyfish

31
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,386
You probably want to know
how it happened.

32
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,088
I think I can figure it out.

33
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,156
I was born, and then
everyone lied their asses off.

34
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,362
No, it wasn't like that.

35
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,189
Remember how I said
Lilly, Frank and I were close?

36
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,026
We were very close.

37
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,669
How close?

38
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,467
The three of us were
kind of a couple.

39
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,745
I don't know how that would work.

40
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,039
I'm not asking!

41
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,941
Anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...

42
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,142
...and I was...

43
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,113
...scared.
I was stupid and selfish...

44
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:50,452
I was 18 years old.
Remember what it was like to be 18?

45
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,496
Mom killed herself
and my dad ran off.

46
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,669
I lived in a Gremlin with a guy
who talked to his hand.

47
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:04,343
I'm sorry. I thought I'd left you
with the best parents.

48
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,377
I didn't hear about them
till a few years ago.

49
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,808
By then, you were already grown-up.

50
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:14,579
You're here and I would
really like to get to know you.

51
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,654
Well, everybody does.

52
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,949
I'm a really cool person.

53
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,128
You had 29 years to find out,
but you didn't even try.

54
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,525
You walked out on me,
and I'll do the same.

55
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,026
I don't ever want to see you again.

56
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,943
Where's my purse?

57
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,837
Shoot! We're out of soda.

58
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,447
-I'll get you some.
-Really?

59
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,017
No, because I'm not your boyfriend.

60
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,955
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?

61
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,929
My mom's friend, Phoebe,
is actually my birth mom.

62
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,665
I found a dried-up seahorse.

63
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,103
What do you mean?

64
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,274
My new mom,
who's a big fat abandoner.

65
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,245
Don't you want to stay here
and talk about it?

66
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,977
I need to be alone.

67
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,051
Man. Hey...

68
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,528
...what if you found out that
your mom wasn't really your mom...

69
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,362
...and your new mom turned
out to be really hot?

70
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,403
Oh, man, huh?

71
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,270
But, it's your mom.

72
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,936
No, I'm talking about your mom.

73
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,846
It's over.

74
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,085
Was it awful?

75
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,749
It was long.

76
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,621
I didn't realize how late it was...

77
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,857
...till I saw the five o'clock shadow
on her head.

78
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:17,333
She didn't want to stay.
I called a cab. She just left.

79
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,008
I wrote you a letter.

80
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,117
Oh, thank you!

81
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,020
I like mail.

82
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:40,425
It's just some things I've been
thinking about. About us.

83
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,102
Before we even think about us
getting back together...

84
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,397
...I need to know
how you feel about this stuff.

85
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,011
It's 5:30 in the morning.

86
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,347
So I'd better get
cracking on this baby.

87
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,459
I'll be waiting for you.
Come up when you're done.

88
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,533
I'll be up...

89
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,835
...in 18 pages.

90
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,302
Front and back.

91
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,006
Very exciting!

92
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,504
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come up?

93
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,332
Done.

94
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,373
-You just finished?
-I wanted to be thorough.

95
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,244
This is clearly
very important to you. To us.

96
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:09,184
I wanted to read
every word carefully.

97
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,652
Twice.

98
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,928
Does it?

99
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,302
I'm sorry?

100
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,130
Does it?

101
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,335
Does it? Does it?

102
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:39,811
I wanted to give that whole
"Does it?" part another glance.

103
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,080
What do you mean?
You said you read it twice.

104
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,951
It either does or doesn't.
If you have to think

105
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,458
No, I don't have to think about it.

106
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,925
In fact...

107
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,428
...I've decided.
I have decided...

108
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,596
...that it...

109
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,474
...does.

110
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,195
-Are you sure?
-Sure, I'm sure!

111
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,634
There's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

112
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,203
Would you go out with me?

113
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,950
I've got canned goods.

114
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,079
Take a look at this!

115
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,450
Check this baby out!
Dug me a hole.

116
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,586
Excellent hole, Joe.

117
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,595
Oh, no! My hole!

118
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,256
My foot!

119
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,428
What is it?

120
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,932
Jellyfish sting!
It hurts!

121
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,198
Can we help you to the house?

122
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,740
It's two miles.

123
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,208
And I'm tired from digging.

124
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,544
Damn the jellyfish!

125
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,251
Damn all the jellyfish!

126
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,750
Do something.

127
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,455
There's only one thing.

128
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,748
What is it?

129
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,253
Pee on it.

130
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,084
Gross!

131
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,490
I saw it on Discovery Channel.

132
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,131
He's right.
There's ammonia in that...

133
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,167
...that kills the pain.

134
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:42,305
Forget it.
It doesn't hurt that bad!

135
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,409
You can use my hole for privacy.

136
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,144
I'm ready to get
the hell out of here.

137
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,780
Are you?

138
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,423
That's so great!

139
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,919
Not for Bonnie.

140
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,453
But for you, yea!

141
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,832
-How was the beach?
-Nothing. I don't know.

142
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,506
-What happened?
-Nothing.

143
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,175
-I'm going to shower.
-Me too.

144
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,637
Me too.

145
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,606
I'll put this in the car.

146
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,008
I have to go pack!

147
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,012
-And it really does?
-It does.

148
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,313
It really and truly does.

149
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,810
It so does not!

150
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:06,449
She wants me to take responsibility
for everything that went wrong.

151
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:11,928
She goes on for five pages
about how I was unfaithful to her.

152
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,225
We were on a break!

153
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,665
If you say that one more time,
I'll break up with you.

154
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,736
This breakup was not all my fault.
She says here...

155
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,842
..."If you accept
full responsibility...

156
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,572
...I can begin to trust you again.

157
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,446
Does that seem like
something you can do? Does it?"

158
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,057
You have what you want.
You're back with her.

159
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,230
If you bring this up now,
you'll wreck it.

160
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,864
Yeah, I know.
You're right.

161
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,331
I'll let it go.

162
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,801
But you know how hard it is
to forget this?

163
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,633
Sure, it's hard...

164
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,640
...but you don't have to talk about it.

165
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,947
A lot happened on that trip...

166
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,313
...that we should
never, ever talk about.

167
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,117
What happened on that beach?

168
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,818
It's between us and the sea, Ross.

169
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,804
Hi, Ursula.

170
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,836
I know that we haven't talked
in a long time.

171
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:37,878
Our mom is not our birth mom.
This other lady is our birth mom.

172
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,245
Right, the one that lives in Montauk.

173
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,709
You know her?

174
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,719
No. I read about her
in Mom's suicide note.

175
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:51,224
There was a suicide note?
Do you still have it?

176
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,756
Hang on.

177
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,036
I can't believe you didn't tell me
there was a suicide note.

178
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,500
Yeah, so how have you been doing?

179
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,139
Shut up!

180
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,343
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
I'll miss you.

181
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,041
P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."

182
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,787
You just wrote this!

183
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,884
It's pretty much the gist.

184
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,289
Except for the poem.
You read the poem, right?

185
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,591
All right. Hang on.

186
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,565
Pass the cheese, please.

187
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,816
You can't even look at me, can you?

188
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,119
It's Phoebe!
We can talk to Phoebe!

189
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,187
I'm too depressed to talk.

190
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,621
I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.

191
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,961
What about making that
beach trip an annual thing?

192
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,204
What happened out there?

193
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,970
What? We took a walk.
Nothing happened.

194
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,109
I came back with nothing all over me.

195
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,410
What happened?
Joey?

196
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,209
All right.

197
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,384
We swore we'd never tell.

198
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,644
They'll never understand.

199
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,657
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive!

200
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,930
-Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
-All right!

201
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,537
I got stung.

202
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,508
Stung bad.

203
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,244
I couldn't stand.

204
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,447
I couldn't walk.

205
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,247
We were two miles from the house.

206
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,616
We were scared and alone.

207
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,818
We didn't think we could make it.

208
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,824
I was in too much pain.

209
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,162
And I was tired from digging.

210
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,335
Then Joey remembered something.

211
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,776
I'd seen it on Discovery Channel.

212
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,640
Wait, I saw that.

213
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:27,308
On the Discovery Channel.
About jellyfish and how if you

214
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,448
You peed on yourself?

215
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,755
You can't say that!
You don't know!

216
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,562
I thought I would pass out.

217
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,429
I tried, but I couldn't...

218
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,100
...bend that way.

219
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,814
That's right.
I stepped up.

220
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,051
She's my friend and she needed help.

221
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,991
If I had to,
I'd pee on any of you.

222
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,723
Only...

223
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,093
...I couldn't.

224
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,730
I got the stage fright.

225
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:27,111
I wanted to help,
but there was too much pressure.

226
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,438
So I turned to Chandler.

227
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:37,121
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it now. Do it. Do it now!"

228
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,288
Sometimes, late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

229
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,663
Because I do it through my wall
to freak you out.

230
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,327
Maybe there's somebody
you guys could talk to.

231
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,097
Oh, who?

232
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,366
It's not like they have a group
for people like us.

233
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,804
Yeah, no, there's this
guy Owen, he's the best.

234
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,345
Might have his card.

235
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,513
And fuchsia and mauve

236
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:13,557
Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom

237
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:20,690
I invite all of you to count
the colors in your bedroom.

238
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,999
Except for you.
You go away.

239
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,031
I'll go in a second.

240
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,209
I just want to tell you...

241
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,312
...there wasn't a day
I didn't regret giving you up.

242
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,240
Okay, bye.

243
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,212
I'm not done.

244
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,878
The reason I never
looked you up was because...

245
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,191
...I was afraid you'd react...

246
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,759
...just like the way
you're reacting now.

247
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,465
Can't we just start from here?
Please?

248
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,966
No.

249
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,840
Sorry.

250
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,179
One last thing.

251
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,815
You came looking for family.

252
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,979
I'm family.

253
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,218
I'm it.

254
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,688
Now I'm done.

255
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,028
It's not like we're losing anything.

256
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,899
I guess you're right.

257
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:36,807
It's not like we know each other
or have anything in common.

258
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,107
I don't know.
It's not like...

259
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,973
...we don't have anything in common.

260
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,081
I mean, I like pizza.

261
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,512
I like pizza!

262
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,957
Wait, I like the Beatles.

263
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,692
Oh, my God!
So do I.

264
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,055
Puppies.
Cute or ugly?

265
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,222
So cute!

266
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,135
You see?

267
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,804
But I'm still mad at you.

268
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,530
I know.

269
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,475
I'm mad at me too.

270
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:17,514
Do you want to get something to eat?
I'm kind of hungry.

271
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,680
Hey! Me too!

272
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,876
Uncanny.

273
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,123
It looks like rain
and I don't have my umbrella.

274
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,781
Me neither. I really hate that.

275
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,657
Stop it. Now you're just
doing it to freak me out.

276
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,330
I missed you.

277
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,436
I missed you too.

278
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,268
I was so nervous about that letter.

279
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,515
But the way you
owned up to everything...

280
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,243
...it just showed me
how much you've grown.

281
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,456
I suppose.

282
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:06,187
You have, Ross.
You should give yourself credit.

283
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:10,025
My mom never thought
this would work out.

284
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,802
She said, "Once a cheater,
always a cheater."

285
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,836
I just wish we hadn't
lost those four months.

286
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:27,282
But if time was what you needed
to gain a little perspective...

287
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,717
We were on a break!

288
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,915
-Coffeehouse?
-You bet.

289
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:39,488
It took two people
to break up this relationship.

290
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:44,794
You and that girl, which yesterday
you took full responsibility for.

291
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,800
I didn't know what
I took responsibility for.

292
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,837
I didn't finish the letter.

293
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,904
I fell asleep.

294
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,168
You fell asleep?

295
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,980
It was 5:30 in the morning.

296
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:03,085
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

297
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,650
Front and back!

298
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,329
By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E
means "you are."

299
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,225
Y-O-U-R means "your."

300
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:21,237
I can't believe I thought of getting
back with you! We are so over.

301
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,406
Fine by me!

302
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,841
Those spelling tips will be handy
Saturday nights at home...

303
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,947
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

304
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,846
Sorry!

305
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,547
All that sleep you'll miss
wishing you were with me!

306
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,191
Don't worry about me falling asleep.

307
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,721
I still have your letter!

308
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,430
Just so you know,
it's not that common.

309
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,897
It doesn't happen to every guy.

310
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,037
And it is a big deal!

311
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,702
I knew it!

312
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,505
Gin.

313
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,972
We were playing gin?

314
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,215
If we were a couple,
we could play naked.

315
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,718
-Would you stop?
-Okay. All right.

316
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:15,823
All right.

317
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,722
I think you're great.

318
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,826
I think you're sweet and smart...

319
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,425
...and I love you.

320
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,769
But you'll always be the guy
who peed on me.
