1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,433
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,333
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,032
In London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:16,043
Six-hour trip to London.
That's a lot of Monica.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,942
What have you got there?

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,110
Condoms, dude.

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,951
Well, how come the
writing is in spanish?

8
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,861
Don't read my condoms.

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:34,197
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check.

10
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,699
-Who are you saying "check" to?
-Myself.

11
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,403
For remembering to pack a thing.

12
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,301
You do a good thing,
you get a "check."

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,137
Mom does it.
I never realized it was weird.

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,745
My mom used to put her head
in the oven.

15
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:53,608
Actually, only the one time.
But it's pretty weird.

16
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:58,913
Are you ready yet?

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,593
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,593
It's all London, baby!

19
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,924
Here we go.

20
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,758
Got your passport?

21
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,934
Third drawer of my dresser.
You don't want to lose that!

22
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,177
There it is!

23
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,783
The One With Ross' Wedding

24
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,858
The vacuum's in my closet
on the left side.

25
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,467
Garbage bags are next
to the refrigerator.

26
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,299
Rachel's gonna be here.
Can't I just ask her?

27
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,105
Yeah, okay. Give that a try!

28
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,746
-Let's do it.
-Cheerio!

29
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,380
London, baby!

30
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,712
That's not gonna get annoying.

31
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,044
London, baby!

32
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,087
You know what?
I was wrong.

33
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,656
We're all here.
Let's get going!

34
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,018
I want to go over and hug you...

35
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,095
...and wish you luck,
but I can't get up.

36
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,698
-I'll come hug you.
-Great, can you bring me the paper?

37
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,963
-Have a great wedding.
-Thanks.

38
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,764
Chandler, I want to hug you too!

39
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,638
You might as well bring my book
from your apartment.

40
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,443
-So we're off.
-Have fun!

41
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,755
-I can't believe you won't be there.
-I know.

42
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,585
Come. Why don't you come?

43
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,321
To London. Please?
It would mean so much to me.

44
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,993
I gotta work. I'm sorry.

45
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,998
Why can't you take
a couple of days off?

46
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,236
Because I can't.
I told you.

47
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,701
This is my wedding.

48
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,442
Now we are late.
Let's go, let's go!

49
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,111
Fine, you'll watch it
on video when we get back.

50
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,910
Here you go, Phoebe!
Phoe-bo! Phoo-ba-la!

51
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,890
You!

52
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,258
Let's go!

53
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,929
Bye, Pheebs!

54
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,194
London, baby!

55
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,299
Oh, God!

56
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,836
Do you need a hug?

57
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,370
You don't have to bring me anything.

58
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,431
Chandler, do something!

59
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,832
-Do something!
-I am. I'm ignoring you.

60
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,167
I'll be the on-camera guy.

61
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,934
All right. First stop...

62
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,373
...Westminster Abbey.

63
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,504
What is that?

64
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,682
That's London, baby!

65
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,874
All right, the hotel's here.

66
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,177
Wait.

67
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,681
We want to go

68
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,952
I know.

69
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,652
I'm gonna have to go into the map.

70
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,195
If you see a little version
of me in there, kill it!

71
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,394
I got it.

72
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,570
Here we go!

73
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:15,644
We're not gonna have to walk this way
the entire time, are we?

74
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,182
Man, you made me lose it!

75
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,552
That was all before 10:00.

76
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:33,027
The caterer rang. It'll be Chicken
Kiev, not Tarragon.

77
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,665
Then the florist said
there are no tulips.

78
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,336
And the cellist has
carpal tunnel syndrome

79
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,498
Emily, honey. Okay?

80
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,933
Well, up yours too!

81
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,137
-What?
-Oh, that's not what it means.

82
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,111
-No! That's "time out."
-Sorry.

83
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:54,285
Sweetie, relax.
Everything will be great, okay?

84
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,351
Come on, come on.

85
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,922
Chicken Kiev?

86
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,618
Doesn't that sound delicious
at the last minute?

87
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,193
Salmon would be
more elegant than chicken.

88
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,335
And you wouldn't worry
about the salmonella.

89
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,600
But of course...

90
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:20,474
...with salmon you would have
to worry about the chicknella.

91
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,738
I can't wait to see
where you're getting married.

92
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,441
It's beautiful.
Her parents got married here.

93
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,677
I can't believe
they're tearing it down.

94
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,984
It's really the most lovely building.
It's over

95
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,987
Oh, my God!

96
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,727
It's nice.

97
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,638
Oh, my God!

98
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,813
What are we going to do?

99
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,241
Everything's gonna be all right.

100
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,712
How's it gonna be all right?

101
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,442
I see that.

102
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,821
I talked to a guy,
and I found out what happened.

103
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,547
They tore it down early.

104
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,772
All right!

105
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,207
Westminster Abbey.

106
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,904
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

107
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,150
What do you think of the Abbey?

108
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,221
It's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

109
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,587
-To what?
-To "Put the Camera Away"!

110
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,291
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

111
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,172
Don't worry, you'll find
some place to get married.

112
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,746
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red.

113
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,814
We can't find another place.

114
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,553
Then we can't have the wedding.

115
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,988
I've ordered chicken, and salad,
and cake for a 150.

116
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,190
What should be the most wonderfull day
of my life...

117
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,957
...is rapidly turning into just Sunday
with a spectacular amount of food.

118
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,831
You're gonna find a place.

119
00:08:56,002 --> 00:09:00,132
But even if, God forbid, you didn't,
so you postpone the wedding.

120
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,773
Is that really so bad?

121
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,909
Think about it. You could take all the time
your needed to get everything that you want.

122
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,843
You could have tulips.
You could have salmon.

123
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,007
Salmon.

124
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,382
I suppose it wouldn't be
the end of the world.

125
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,788
Oh, thank you.

126
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,893
Look, either way you're gonna get
married. You're gonna be happy.

127
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,052
My mom's gonna like you better than me.

128
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,759
Oh, God. She has told you
that already, didn't she?

129
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,298
-Don't get up. What do you need?
-Nothing.

130
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,035
Come on. I'm here
to take care of you.

131
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,546
Okay, I have a wedgie.

132
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,684
That is all you.

133
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,422
What do you want for lunch?

134
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,819
I don't know.

135
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,959
I guess we have to eat.

136
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,560
Yeah, I do.

137
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,223
What's the matter?

138
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,094
I'm bummed the way
I left things with Ross.

139
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,397
I wish I didn't lie about work.
He seemed so mad at me.

140
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,337
Don't be so hard on yourself.
If I was still in love with some

141
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,204
Still in love with?

142
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,015
I'm not in love with Ross.

143
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,915
Good!

144
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,749
Yeah, me neither.

145
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,725
I'm not at the wedding,
because he's my ex-boyfriend...

146
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,020
...and that would be uncomfortable.

147
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:36,425
Not because I'm in love with him.
I like Ross as much as anyone.

148
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,331
Clearly, I have feelings for him,
but they don't mean love.

149
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,873
I mean, do I still have
loving feelings for Ross? Yeah!

150
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,577
I have continuing feelings of love.

151
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,682
But that doesn't mean
I'm still in love with him.

152
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:56,344
I have sexual feelings for him,
but I do love him.

153
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,747
Oh, my God!

154
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,921
Why didn't you tell me?

155
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,865
-We thought you knew!
-We?

156
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,192
We all know.
We talk about it all the time.

157
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,564
You all know?
Does Ross know?

158
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,435
No! Ross doesn't know anything.

159
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,741
And you didn't tell me!

160
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,311
We thought you knew.
It's so obvious!

161
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,412
It would be like telling Monica:

162
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,278
"Hey, you like things clean."

163
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,421
Or, you know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."

164
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,416
What?

165
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,697
Oh, please, she's always got
a broom in her hand.

166
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:53,107
What are you in the market for?
Scarves, souvenir postcards...

167
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,279
Check this out!

168
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,715
That's the stuff!
What do you think?

169
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,251
I won't need that
"I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.

170
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,821
Well, I like it. Here you go.

171
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,722
You're not really buying that.
Haven't you embarrassed me enough?

172
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,157
Oh, I embarrass you?

173
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,492
How can I answer when
I'm pretending I don't know you?

174
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,302
He's just jealous.
All Londoners wear them.

175
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,338
Really? Then how come no one here
anywhere is wearing one?

176
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,902
They're all tourists.

177
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,005
If you insist on wearing that
in public...

178
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,581
...you're gonna spend the afternoon
all by yourself.

179
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,150
If you make me choose between
you and the hat, I choose the hat.

180
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,021
-Good choice.
-Thanks.

181
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,997
That's it! I'm out of here.
I won't be embarrassed any more.

182
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,342
How are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani, America.

183
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,017
I spoke to your dad,
and you know what?

184
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,419
He thinks we can find a new hall.

185
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,128
-We don't have to.
-You found a place?

186
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,662
No, but Monica and I were talking...

187
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,096
...and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down...

188
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,329
...and she suggested we put
the wedding off for a bit.

189
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,835
She said what?

190
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,207
If I won't be happy with somewhere
we'd find in a day...

191
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,312
...we should postpone it.

192
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,684
Postpone it.

193
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,653
Do you think Monica realizes
how much our parents spent on this?

194
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,160
Do you think my sister's teeny,
tiny, little brain comprehends...

195
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,730
...that people took time
out of their lives...

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,026
...to fly thousands of miles
to be here?

197
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,367
This isn't right.

198
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,968
I realize that people
are gonna be disappointed.

199
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,341
But I'm sure they'll come back.

200
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,041
I can't ask people to do that.
Would you?

201
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,810
Don't you point your pants at me!

202
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,051
We have no choice.

203
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,385
Anywhere half-decent
will have been booked.

204
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,152
Don't you understand?
This is our wedding!

205
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:30,061
Postponing it is not an option.
This is when we're getting married.

206
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,295
-You're saying it's now or never?
-I'm saying it's now.

207
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,803
-Or?
-There's no "or" in mine!

208
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,975
What is wrong with these pants?

209
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,073
It's not the pants.
It's you who's backwards.

210
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,479
If you don't understand
how important this is to me...

211
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,482
...perhaps we shouldn't marry at all!

212
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,452
Emily, no! Wait, stop!
Emily, please

213
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,828
Did shopping help you
feel any better?

214
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,800
Manhattan doesn't have enough stores.

215
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,665
I can help you get over him.

216
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,139
You can?

217
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,711
I need you to bring me
photos of Ross...

218
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,609
...and a small piece of chocolate...

219
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,716
...and a glass of tepid water.

220
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,011
Is this where you throw stuff...

221
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,556
...in a bag with graveyard dirt
and hang it from a north-facing tree?

222
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,317
Only if you have the hiccups too.

223
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,462
The chocolate and water are for me.
I didn't feel like getting up.

224
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,136
I'll show you a picture of Ross.

225
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:45,138
And you remember all
the bad things about him.

226
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,572
-Focus on his flaws.
-I can do that.

227
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,077
I did that
while we were going out.

228
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,918
Before we start, I want to say,
for the record, I love Ross.

229
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,019
He's such a great guy.

230
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,090
Close your eyes.

231
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,431
Imagine that you're with Ross.

232
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,691
Imagine that you're kissing him.

233
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,496
You're running your hands
all over his body.

234
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,333
You run your hands
through his hair but

235
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,909
Gross!
It's some kind of grease.

236
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,541
I don't know.

237
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,514
His hair never bothered me that much.

238
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,552
It was more crunchy
than it was greasy.

239
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,420
This will be harder than I thought.

240
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,925
Let's try some aversion therapy.

241
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,432
Look at the picture.

242
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,470
How do you feel now?

243
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,702
Well, I like you less.

244
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,311
Sorry.

245
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,308
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said
you were embarrassing me.

246
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,814
That wasn't cool.

247
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:37,079
If it makes you feel any better,
I've had a really lousy day.

248
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,652
Me too.

249
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,556
-Yeah?
-No!

250
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,992
I had the best day ever!

251
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,490
Dude, check this out!

252
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,841
Tell my friend you like my hat.

253
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,946
-What's your friend's name?
-Chandler.

254
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,241
Hi, Chandler.

255
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:09,181
-That's
-That's Fergie, baby!

256
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:15,123
Joey says you don't like his hat,
but I think it's kind of dashing.

257
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,422
So I hear you're single now.

258
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,633
- Yeah, I don't like the hat that much.
-Okay.

259
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,331
When did you?
How?

260
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,772
I was trying to get
to Buckingham Palace.

261
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,964
So I'm in my map and

262
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,646
I understand you had
a talk with Emily.

263
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,339
Yes, I did.

264
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,484
And you are welcome.

265
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,510
Am I?

266
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,992
Was it your idea
to postpone the wedding?

267
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,688
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Wait up!

268
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,395
Since you're the fix-it lady,
here's a pickle:

269
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:04,131
What do you do when the bride says
she doesn't want the wedding at all?

270
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,237
She said that?
Why?

271
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,313
I don't know. I said it was stupid
to put off the wedding...

272
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,984
...and she, like, flipped out.

273
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,853
Oh, my God!
You're even dumber than I am.

274
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,414
Excuse me?

275
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,827
How long have you been planning
this wedding?

276
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,357
I don't know. A month?

277
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,761
Emily's probably been planning it
since she was 5.

278
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,664
Ever since the first time she hung
a pillowcase from her head.

279
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,269
That's what we did.

280
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,703
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.

281
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,346
In the perfect place.

282
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,679
With the perfect
four-tiered wedding cake.

283
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,743
With the little people on top.

284
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,925
But the most important part...

285
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,634
...is that we had the perfect guy...

286
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:08,032
...who understood just how important
all that stuff was.

287
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,967
I had no idea.

288
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:17,247
That pillowcase thing, I thought
you were doing The Flying Nun.

289
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,415
Sometimes we were.

290
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,716
Come on.

291
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,990
Help me figure out what to do.

292
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,962
Pretty intense, huh?

293
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,572
I hope Ross didn't think we left
because we were uncomfortable here.

294
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,411
I hope he did.

295
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,218
I thought of a good flaw.
Ross pops his gum.

296
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,187
Oh, right.

297
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,756
-Wait a minute. I do that too.
-I know, it drives me crazy.

298
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,567
I'll get it.

299
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,703
Pheebs, it's Joey.

300
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,372
Hey, Joey!

301
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,106
I saw someone that looks just
like you on the subway.

302
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:23,712
I was going to say hi, then I figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

303
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,645
That just cost me 4 bucks.

304
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,945
I called to see how the chick
and the duck are doing.

305
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,649
They're having fun with Aunt Phoebe.
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful.

306
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,960
So do you miss me?

307
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,031
Kind of, but I've been
having too much fun.

308
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,633
You're not homesick yet?

309
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,035
I don't think so.

310
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,803
Well, the seven of us miss you.

311
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,707
-Who's seven?
-Me, Rachel...

312
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,245
...the birds, the babies.

313
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,746
The babies miss me?

314
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:04,455
Of course they do, or
I'm just really hungry.

315
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,415
Pizza guy's here!

316
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,753
You ordered pizza without me?

317
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,421
But we were thinking about you.
We ordered the Joey Special.

318
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,294
Two pizzas?

319
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,667
-Gotta go! Talk to you later.
-Wait!

320
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,772
Where did you get it from?

321
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,249
And they're always glad you came

322
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,057
You want to be where you can see

323
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,557
Your troubles are all the same

324
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:48,061
You want to be
Where everybody knows your name

325
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,935
Why have you brought me here?

326
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,334
You'll see.

327
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,469
This wedding won't happen.

328
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,477
Ross.

329
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,149
But imagine a lot more lights...

330
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,976
...and fewer bricks...

331
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,779
...and flowers and candles.

332
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,618
And the musicians can go over here.

333
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,294
The chairs can face this way and

334
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,618
You go.

335
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,990
But if you don't love this,
we'll do it any other place or time.

336
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,861
Really, it's fine.

337
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,765
Whatever you want.

338
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,968
It's perfect.

339
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,637
And, I don't know, if it rains

340
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,437
Then we'll get wet.

341
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,210
I don't even have a date.

342
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,560
Do you remember
where the duck food is?

343
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,525
In the guys' apartment,
under the sink. Why?

344
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,729
Because I'm going to London.

345
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,865
What? What do you mean?

346
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,296
I have to tell Ross I love him.

347
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,496
Take care and don't have
the babies till I get back.

348
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,804
But what about all the
finding-his-flaws stuff we've been doing?

349
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,876
Yeah, that didn't work.

350
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,082
You can't go.
Ross loves Emily.

351
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,046
I know, but I have
to tell him how I feel.

352
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,813
He deserves all the information
to make an informed decision.

353
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,993
You're going
because you hope he'll say:

354
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,128
"I love you too.
Forget the British chippy."

355
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,558
You think he will?

356
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,566
No, because he's in love
with the British chippy!

357
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,870
You're just gonna mess with his head
and ruin his wedding.

358
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,907
It's too late!
You missed your chance.

359
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,875
I'm sorry.
This must be hard.

360
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,415
But it's over.

361
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,314
No, it's not over
until someone says, "I do."

362
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,721
I do! I do!

363
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,694
Like I can really chase you.
I'm carrying a litter!

364
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,411
The Waltham residence.

365
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,582
Is this Emily's parents' house?

366
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,946
This is the housekeeper speaking.

367
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:28,889
And, by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

368
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,829
First one identifies oneself...

369
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,328
...and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

370
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,568
What are you saying?

371
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,669
Now, let us try that again, shall we?

372
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,707
No!

373
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,937
Oh, my God!

374
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,550
-The Waltham residence.
-Hello.

375
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,917
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...

376
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,786
...if it's not
too much trouble, please...

377
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,085
...might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

378
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,662
Miss Waltham is
at the rehearsal dinner.

379
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,836
And it is not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.

380
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:17,073
I'll be nice, I swear. Could you just
give me the number for where they are?

381
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:21,405
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

382
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:25,674
Somebody is on their way to ruin the
wedding, and I have to warn somebody.

383
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,943
So if you don't give me that number,
I'm gonna come over there...

384
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:33,614
...and I'm gonna kick your snooty ass
all the way to New Gloukenshire!

385
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,394
Hello? Hello?

386
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,189
She knew I could kick her ass.

387
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:48,670
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Mom, Dad.

388
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,034
Sorry we're late.

389
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,369
My fault.
I insisted on riding the tube.

390
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,636
Judy, the kids!

391
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,941
Jack, that's what they call the subway.

392
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,616
-I thought
-Dad, we got it.

393
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,320
Here comes my dad and stepmom.

394
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,717
Mr. and Mrs. Geller.

395
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,789
-This is Steven...
-Hello, darling.

396
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,550
...and Andrea Waltham.

397
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,662
Very nice to meet you.

398
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,727
Darling, the Gellers.

399
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,593
Darling, it's the Gellers.

400
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:20,430
She's very self-involved.
I should never have married her.

401
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,132
-It's the Gellers.
-Where?

402
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,276
That's one and that's another one.

403
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,004
Lovely to meet you.

404
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,510
Nice of you to offer to pay
for half the wedding.

405
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,275
The hell with tradition.
We're happy to do it.

406
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,249
We know how expensive
weddings can be.

407
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,458
Besides, this may be
the only wedding we get to throw.

408
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,490
A joke that's funny in all countries.

409
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,757
Sir?

410
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,402
-What's in it?
-Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.

411
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,070
That's not food.

412
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,873
Everything's different here.
I want to go home.

413
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,519
I miss my family, the coffeehouse.

414
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:12,052
I can't even remember
what Phoebe looks like!

415
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,719
It's been three days.

416
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,553
Okay, you're just homesick.

417
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,061
Would you just try to relax
and just enjoy yourself?

418
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,998
You're different here too.

419
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,096
You're mean in England!

420
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,838
What the hell?

421
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,031
What's up, Dad?

422
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,939
This bill for my half of the wedding.
It's insane.

423
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,774
How can it be so much?
The reception's at their house.

424
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,952
Flowers, liquor.
Re-carpet first floor?

425
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,849
New guest bath, landscaping.

426
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,353
I'm paying to remodel this guy's house.

427
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,426
I'm gonna give that son of a bitch
a piece of my mind.

428
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:51,984
Please.

429
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,791
I don't want anything
to upset Emily tonight.

430
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,866
She's had a hard enough
couple of days as it is.

431
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,469
Here.
Let me go talk to him.

432
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,971
You tell him no one takes advantage
of the Gellers.

433
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,370
Sometimes I forget
how powerful you can be.

434
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,215
And I'm gonna go get drunk.

435
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,329
-Hello.
-Hello.

436
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,524
When is your next
flight to London?

437
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,098
There's one leaving in 30 minutes.

438
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,735
And I do have one seat left.

439
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,466
Thank you, thank you.

440
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:38,631
The last-minute fare
on this ticket is $2700.

441
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,114
Huh. How about 600?

442
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,739
-Sorry.
-How about 600 and these earrings?

443
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,513
They prefer it if I don't barter.

444
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,452
I don't think I have enough left
on my credit card.

445
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,127
You can split it with another card.

446
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,262
How about five?

447
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,396
Thank you.

448
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm just going to need
to see your passport.

449
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,242
I don't have it, but I can tell you
exactly where it is on my nightstand.

450
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,346
You know what?
I have my driver's license.

451
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,076
And I have a 20.

452
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:29,159
Face it. My father is not going to pay
for the built-in barbecue.

453
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,486
And believe me, you can
kiss your gazebo goodbye.

454
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,257
I might be able
to get you the new lawn.

455
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,232
Then you have to give us
the lawn ornaments.

456
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:45,064
I go back there with lawn ornaments,
he'll laugh in my face.

457
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,278
This is ridiculous.
I mean, we had an agreement.

458
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,447
Will you say something, Steven?

459
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,252
Don't take that tone with me.

460
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:59,947
All right, you can.

461
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,429
Thank God!

462
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,963
You changed your mind.

463
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:13,160
You probably want to be alone,
you don't want to talk about it.

464
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,965
You're doing the right thing.

465
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,605
Where are you going?

466
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,242
What are you doing? No, wait.

467
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,408
Why am I always pregnant
when she does that?

468
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,916
I'd like to make a toast
to Ross and Emily.

469
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,850
My big toast is tomorrow.

470
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:41,191
This is kind of my little toast,
or Melba toast, if you will.

471
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,936
Okay.

472
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:50,803
I've known Ross for a long time. I knew
him when he was with his first girlfriend.

473
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,244
I thought things were going to work out
for him, until the day he over-inflated her.

474
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,278
Oh, dear God!

475
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,882
Hello, Waltham Interiors.

476
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,524
Mrs. Waltham.

477
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:12,456
I need to speak with one of the
best men or Ross' sister, Monica.

478
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:17,295
-Who is this?
-Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.

479
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,598
How did you get this number?

480
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:24,140
I got it from your maid.
She's a bitch, but I wore her down.

481
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,643
If you're one of Ross' best friends,
why aren't you here?

482
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,110
I can't fly.
I'm having my brother's babies.

483
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,346
Am I on the radio?

484
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,317
Can I talk to one of them?
It's important.

485
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,622
I'm bored of you now.
I'm going to cut you off.

486
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:51,867
Oh, okay, I'm going
to have to kick her ass too.

487
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:57,537
We're excited that Ross and Emily are
getting married at Montgomery Hall.

488
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,542
To think, my friend getting
married in Monty Hall.

489
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,907
Come on, Monty Hall!

490
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,843
Let's Make a Deal.
Come on, you people!

491
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,111
All right, forget it.
Congratulations, Ross and Emily.

492
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,923
Best man number two, Joey Tribbiani.

493
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,029
I'm not good with the jokes
like Chandler here.

494
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,163
Congratulations to the happy couple.

495
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,431
I first met Ross
in this coffeehouse back home.

496
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,677
Home.

497
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,746
New York City.

498
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,285
Where everybody knows my name.

499
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,420
Anyway...

500
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,692
...I love you guys.

501
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,860
But not as much as I love America.

502
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,761
Can we please go home now?

503
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,565
Are you going home?

504
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,469
I was hoping to get
to know you better.

505
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,973
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

506
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,448
I was laughing.

507
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:18,945
Out loud?

508
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,821
I didn't want everyone
to think I was stupid.

509
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,217
So how are you?

510
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,260
My mother's driving me crazy.
But Ross is getting married. I'm happy.

511
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,664
I'm not going to let
anything spoil that.

512
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,838
I just want to say that
Ross is a wonderful young man.

513
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,400
Thanks. We like him.

514
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,212
My God! You must have been
a teenager when you had him.

515
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,317
There's no way in hell
I'm paying for it.

516
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,049
Look, we're down to just one point.

517
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,457
Could we please just settle it
after the wedding?

518
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,997
Fine, but I'm not paying
for your wine cellar...

519
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,670
...you thieving, would-be-speaking-
German-if-it-weren't-for-us, cheap little man!

520
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:16,579
The guy was hammered. There's
no way you look like Ross' mother.

521
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,650
-Then why would he say it?
-Because he's crazy!

522
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:25,118
He came up to me earlier and thanked me
for my very moving performance in Titanic.

523
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,956
My mother's right.
I'll never get married.

524
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,657
You know what, that is

525
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,956
Who wouldn't want you?

526
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,399
Please! I'm a single mom
with a 30-year-old son.

527
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,710
-Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to
-Hello.

528
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,469
Hello. I need to get
on that 11:00 flight.

529
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,172
I'm afraid that plane's already
pulled away from the gate.

530
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,548
You're going to have to call that plane and
tell them to swing around and pick me up.

531
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,616
-Can't do that.
-Sure, you know what?

532
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:05,228
We'll just tell them that there was,
like, a problem with, like, the engine.

533
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,854
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to step aside, miss.

534
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,264
Look, if I don't get to London
he is gonna marry that other girl.

535
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,303
Can't imagine why.

536
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,104
All right. You know what?

537
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:22,178
I am not leaving here until
you call that plane back.

538
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,982
I'm getting married today!

539
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,046
Morning.

540
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,954
-I'm getting married today!
-Yeah, you are.

541
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,658
Do you think he knew I was here?

542
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,553
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

543
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,662
If you're going to do that
throughout the flight, tell me now...

544
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,424
...so that I can take a sedative.

545
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,068
Or perhaps slip you one.

546
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:23,763
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry.

547
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,471
It's just, I'm kind of excited.

548
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,909
I'm going to London...

549
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,209
...to tell this guy that I love him.

550
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,586
Well, I've never done
that with you before.

551
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,631
So how are you?

552
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,629
You okay?

553
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,960
Yeah. Yeah. You?

554
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,868
Oh, yes. Yes.

555
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,201
You?

556
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,236
We did you.

557
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,481
Well...

558
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,777
-I better get going.
-Absolutely.

559
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,383
Could you not look?

560
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,419
I don't want to look.

561
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,473
Where the hell have you been?

562
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:37,373
I spent the night out.
I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so

563
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,877
I don't want to hear it!

564
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,515
Pheebs, you know you're still
my number-one girl.

565
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,250
No. No. We have an emergency.
Rachel's coming to London.

566
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,049
Great!

567
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,557
No, it's not great. She's coming
to tell Ross that she loves him.

568
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:54,856
But he loves Emily.

569
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,862
I know that!

570
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,368
You have to stop her.
She's going to ruin the wedding.

571
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,335
Okay.

572
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,404
-All right, so
-Hold on, hold on.

573
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,477
Rachel coming.

574
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,182
Do...

575
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,048
...something.

576
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,322
I've done my part, okay?

577
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,956
It's your responsibility now.
The burden is off me.

578
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,592
-Right?
-Right.

579
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,194
So tell me about this girl.

580
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,766
And so then I realized,
all the stuff that I had been doing...

581
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:34,962
...proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about
why I couldn't come to the wedding...

582
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,903
-...was all just a way
-Oh, oh, oh, oh!

583
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,339
I'm sorry, can I interrupt?

584
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:46,143
I just want to say that you are
a horrible, horrible person.

585
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,580
Pardon me?

586
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,348
You say you love this man, and yet you're
about to ruin the happiest day of his life.

587
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,787
I'm afraid I have to agree
with your friend Pheebs.

588
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,451
This is a terrible, terrible plan.

589
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,996
-But he has to know how I feel.
-But why?

590
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:06,364
He loves this Emily person.
No good can come of this.

591
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:10,707
-Well, I think you're wrong.
-Oh, no.

592
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:20,675
Well, he doesn't really love her.
It's just a rebound thing from me.

593
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,849
-You'll see.
-Fortunately I won't.

594
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:29,652
And by the way, it seems to be
perfectly clear that you were on a break.

595
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,901
Do something.

596
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,203
Something.

597
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,807
-Have you seen Monica?
-I'm not seeing Monica!

598
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,548
-What?
-What?

599
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:58,748
We gotta find her. Rachel's coming
to tell Ross she loves him.

600
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,787
-Oh, my God!
-I know. Do you know where Monica is?

601
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:06,520
No. What's with the third degree?
Why not just shine a light in my eyes?

602
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,802
Oh, my God!

603
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,543
It's like a fairyland.

604
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,975
I know. It's horrible, isn't it?

605
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,051
I love it. I only hope
my wedding looks this good.

606
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,279
-I just hope
-You can let some of them go by.

607
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,122
Start looking out for Rachel.

608
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,330
I'll cover the front door.
You watch that big hole.

609
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,965
And I got Chandler covering Ross.

610
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,328
Why would I care where Chandler is?

611
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,399
You know...

612
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,168
...sometimes I don't even
like Chandler.

613
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,175
Okay.

614
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,270
I do.

615
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,411
I do.

616
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,685
I do.

617
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,549
-You're right. It's the second one.
-Right?

618
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,616
Hello, Joey.

619
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,386
Hey, Felicity.

620
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,289
I thought about you all day.

621
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,492
Talk New York to me again.

622
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,729
Forget about it.

623
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:24,730
How you doing?

624
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,207
There's nothing to discuss.
We're not paying for your wine cellar.

625
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,407
You have to meet me in the middle here.

626
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,516
My foot's gonna meet
the middle of your ass.

627
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,586
-What's going on?
-Everything's under control.

628
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,920
You want a piece of me, sir?
Is that what you're saying?

629
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:51,031
That's it! Parents! Parents!
Back away!

630
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,996
This is our wedding day!

631
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,536
From now on, everyone gets along.

632
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,934
And if I hear one more word...

633
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,836
...no grandchildren!
That's right!

634
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,206
-Okay, okay.
-Sorry, old boy.

635
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,841
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

636
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,356
What was all that about?

637
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,525
It was this disagreement over

638
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,421
My God! You look beautiful.

639
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,131
You're not meant to see me
before the wedding. It's bad luck.

640
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,738
I think we've had all the bad luck
we're going to have.

641
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,412
My God, Rachel!

642
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,507
You're here.
I can't believe it.

643
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,421
What happened?
Why are you here?

644
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,586
I just came to

645
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,025
I just needed to tell you...

646
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,826
...congratulations.

647
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,266
Hello, Waltham Interiors.

648
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,694
Mrs. Waltham? It's Phoebe.

649
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,464
Why?

650
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:15,444
Can I talk to one of the best men?
This is going to be the last time.

651
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,010
There's a girl on the phone for you.

652
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:20,844
Great!

653
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,143
It's Phoebe.

654
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,581
Did you stop Rachel?

655
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,555
No, but it's okay. She just came in
and gave him a hug. That's it.

656
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,921
-Nothing got ruined?
-No.

657
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,323
That's so great!

658
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,661
So, what's going on now?

659
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,367
I'm walking down the aisle.

660
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,334
Still walking.

661
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,208
I'm about to pass the bridesmaid
I hooked up with last night.

662
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,107
Hey.

663
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,376
I just told her "hey."

664
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,009
I'm at the front with Ross.

665
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,652
It's Phoebe!

666
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,558
He looks pretty mad.

667
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:05,951
I better go.

668
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,598
Wait! Hold it up so I can listen.

669
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,808
-What we did last night was
-Stupid.

670
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,975
Totally crazy, stupid.

671
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,908
What were we thinking?

672
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,583
I'm coming over
tonight though, right?

673
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:30,776
Definitely.

674
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,438
Friends, family...

675
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,673
...we are gathered to celebrate...

676
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,887
...the joyous union
of Ross and Emily.

677
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,147
May the happiness of today...

678
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,585
...be with them always.

679
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,984
Now, Emily, repeat after me.

680
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,696
-I, Emily...
-I, Emily...

681
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,161
-...take thee, Ross...
-...take thee, Ross...

682
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,335
...as my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

683
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,595
...till death parts us.

684
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:25,773
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

685
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,011
...until death parts us.

686
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:29,701
Now, Ross.

687
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,880
Repeat after me.

688
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,708
I, Ross...

689
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,044
I, Ross...

690
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,719
...take thee, Emily...

691
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,616
...take thee, Rachel

692
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,185
Emily.

693
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,097
Emily.

694
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,835
Shall I go on?

695
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,916
"Mother, Mother,
Pizza, Pizza," take one.

696
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:49,684
Oh, the band's ready?
We gotta do what the band says, right?

697
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,159
I don't care about the stupid band!

698
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,325
-Well, it's getting late.
-Here we go.

699
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:02,836
Actually, you guys mind staying here
with me for a while?

700
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:05,975
You know, we gotta get up early
and catch the plane to New York.

701
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,805
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

702
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,693
Why, what's the matter?
