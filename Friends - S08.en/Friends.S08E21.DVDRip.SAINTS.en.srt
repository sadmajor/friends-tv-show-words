1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,960
-Hey. I got some bad news.
-What?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,240
That's no way to sell newspapers.
Try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,480
No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible
review in the Post.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,800
I didn't want her to see it, so I ran
around and bought all the copies.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,520
Two, four, six, one million.
Yeah, you got them all.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,920
This is bad.
And I've had bad reviews.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,040
I remember my first good one:

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,160
"Everything else in Our Town
was terrible.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,200
Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,280
Oh, my God!
Look at all the newspapers.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,200
It must be a good review. Is it great?

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
Oh, dear God.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,760
But the good news is, no one
in a two-block radius will ever know.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,040
-And the rest of Manhattan?
-They all know.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,800
Oh, my God, this is horrible.
I'm so humiliated.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,400
They say there's no such thing
as bad press.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,800
You don't think that "the mahi-mahi
was awful-awful" is bad press?

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,600
I didn't write it.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,480
-God, is he right? Am I awful?
-Oh, no!

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,240
Monica, listen to me.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm not just saying this
because I'm your friend.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,920
Your food is abysmal!

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,480
-Ross?
-What? What?

24
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,160
-I am freaking out!
-Are you?

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,720
My due date is in one week!

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
-What are you doing up?
-That is seven days.

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,920
I had a lot of water.
Can we do this after..?

28
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,800
No, no, no, no, Ross!

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,600
We don't have any big stuff we need.

30
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,960
We don't have a
changing table or a crib.

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,760
-We do not have a diaper service.
-Funny you should mention diapers.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,960
-I'm serious.
-There's nothing to worry about.

33
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,000
There's a baby store on West 10th.
We'll go there..

34
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,600
-and get everything we need. Okay?
-Okay. Thank you. That's great.

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,720
Where on West 10th?
There's a shoe store..

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,360
Okay. If you're gonna do this,
then I'm gonna go do that, so..

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,080
-Wait, Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing.
-Yeah.

38
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,160
Our situation, you know,
what we mean to each other..

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,640
and, I mean, we're having this baby
together and we live together..

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,080
Isn't that..? Isn't that weird?

41
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,480
Well..

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm just kidding. You can go pee.

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Did we say we were gonna meet here
or at the movie?

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,600
-We said at the movies, but..
-I'll see you there.

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,360
-Now that you're here..?
-I'll hang out till I have to meet you.

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,240
-How come you're not going?
-I've got a job interview.

47
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,240
-I thought you already have a job.
-And they say you don't pay attention.

48
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,120
It's a better job.
It's vice president of the company..

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,040
that does data reconfiguration
for other companies.

50
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,040
-Wow. How do you know how to do that?
-That's what I do now.

51
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
-Joey? Come taste this.
-What?

52
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,880
Remember the guy that gave me
a bad review? Well..

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,920
I'm getting my revenge.

54
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
You cooked him?

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,160
No. He teaches a course
at The New School..

56
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,560
I want to make him try
my bouillabaisse again.

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,880
I can't wait to read the front
page tomorrow:

58
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,600
"Restaurant reviewer admits:
'I was wrong about Monica.'"

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,760
The front page?

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,560
You really do live in your own
little world, don't you?

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,960
-I better get to my movie.
-Oh, yeah.

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,920
If I'm going to the movie
and you're going to the movie..

63
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,120
why don't we just go together?

64
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,440
How's that for data reconfiguration,
huh, Chand?

65
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,840
My name's Katie if there's
anything else you need.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Oh, God, I don't know. I want.. Everything
is so great, I just want everything.

67
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,520
Oh, look at this. We need this!

68
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,360
-What is it?
-I don't know.

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,840
Have you ever had two people
who weren't wearing crowns..

70
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,320
spend this much money here?

71
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,000
You have selected a lot of nice things.

72
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,200
You want these delivered,
Mr. and Mrs. Geller?

73
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,320
-Oh, no, no.
-No, no.

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,280
-We're not married.
-We are having a baby..

75
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,440
but we're not involved.

76
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,720
I mean, we were seeing
each other a while ago..

77
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,920
but then we were just friends, and
then there was one drunken night..

78
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,760
Or, yes, stranger,
we'd like this delivered, please.

79
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,000
-Can you fill out this address card?
-Oh, okay.

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,400
-You picked out a lot of dinosaurs.
-Yeah.

81
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,160
That's one of the reasons
why we're not a couple.

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,880
I chose those. I'm a paleontologist.

83
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,320
Really? That is so cool.

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,960
Don't get too worked up. It sounds
like he's a doctor, but he's not.

85
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,520
No. I'm fascinated by paleontology.

86
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,640
-Have you read the Walter Alvarez book?
-I teach it in class.

87
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,040
Standing at a cash register, I'm
holding a credit card, and I'm bored.

88
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,800
I love your neighborhood.
There's a great gym around the corner.

89
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,760
-That's my gym.
-I could tell you work out.

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,960
A paleontologist who works out.
You're like Indiana Jones.

91
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,840
I am like Indiana Jones.

92
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,160
-Hi, Pheebs.
-Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?

93
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,840
Great! We got everything we needed.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,960
Oh, and Ross almost got
something that wasn't on the list.

95
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,200
A whore.

96
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,640
What?

97
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,720
We were paying, and this sales
woman just started flirting with him.

98
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,320
Can you believe that?

99
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,560
-Did she know you two weren't married?
-Yeah.

100
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,800
Oh, my God. Well, the idea..
A woman flirting with a single man?

101
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,840
-We must alert the church elders.
-No.

102
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,280
You don't understand.
You didn't see how brazen she was.

103
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,680
-Sounds like you're jealous.
-No, I'm not.

104
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,760
I just think it's wrong.
I mean, here I am, about to pop..

105
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,160
and he's out picking up
some shopgirl at Sluts-R-Us?

106
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,680
Is that a real place?

107
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,320
Are they hiring?

108
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,320
Hey, Phoebe. Fatty.

109
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,200
Why so fancy?

110
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,080
I got a job interview.

111
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,960
It's more money, and I'd be doing
data reconfiguration.

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,960
-I think I know someone who does that.
-Me. I do that.

113
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,680
So do I look okay?
I'm nervous.

114
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,800
Oh, yeah. You look great.

115
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,080
You know, just don't
get your hopes up.

116
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,000
-Why not?
-Well, the interview.

117
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,560
-Yeah?
-You know.

118
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,920
You don't make a very good
first impression.

119
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,200
-What?
-Oh, you don't know.

120
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,120
-Are you serious?
-When I first met you, you were like:

121
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,280
I was like:

122
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,600
What is it that I do?

123
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,400
It's just, like, you're trying too hard,
making jokes..

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,760
You come off a little needy.

125
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,280
Did you like me when we first met?

126
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,240
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to you.
But I am gonna run away from you.

127
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,720
She's put on so much weight.

128
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,760
There he is.

129
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,120
That smug bastard.

130
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,720
Okay, class.
We'll see you next time.

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,360
There he is.

132
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,560
Hi. I'm Monica Geller,
chef at Allessandro's.

133
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,680
Still?

134
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,000
The things you said were unfair..

135
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,400
and I want you to try
my bouillabaisse again.

136
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,400
I don't see why I'd do
that to myself again.

137
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,440
Either eat it or be in it.

138
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,200
Spoon?

139
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,800
-What do you think?
-I'm torn..

140
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,560
between my integrity
and my desire to avoid a beating.

141
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,960
But I must be honest.
Your soup is abysmal.

142
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,280
Thattagirl! We should get out of here,
there's a new class coming in.

143
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,000
Welcome to Introduction to Cooking.

144
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,120
Can anyone tell me the difference
between hollandaise and bearnaise sauce?

145
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,360
-I can.
-Okay, go ahead.

146
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,040
Well, they both have a egg yolk
and butter base.

147
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,840
But a bearnaise has shallots,
chervil, and most importantly, tarragon.

148
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,640
Very good. What's your name?

149
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,680
-You go to the head of the class!
-Okay!

150
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,840
This stuff takes up a lot of room.

151
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,480
How serious are you about keeping
Ben in your life?

152
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
My son? Pretty serious.

153
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,760
Hi, Katie.
What are you doing here?

154
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,640
The delivery went out
and they forgot this.

155
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,240
It must have been obvious, since it
was the only thing left in your store.

156
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:57,240
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries
aren't really part of my job description.

157
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,160
Oh, I actually came here
to ask you out.

158
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,560
Oh. Wow.
Yeah, that sounds great.

159
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,920
I'm just gonna put this back in my
pocket and pretend that didn't happen.

160
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm free now.
You want to get coffee..?

161
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,320
-Sure.
-Horny bitch.

162
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,000
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!

163
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,880
No, you're a horny bitch!

164
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
You guys have a good time.

165
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,840
I'm just gonna grab my coat.
And my whip.

166
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,400
You know, because of Indiana Jones.

167
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,640
Not because I'm into S & M.

168
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm not into anything weird, you know?

169
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,840
Just normal sex.

170
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,560
So I'm gonna grab my coat.

171
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,080
So you had a good day, huh?
Big commission, picked up a daddy.

172
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,040
Are you okay with this?

173
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please.
You guys have fun.

174
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,080
-Okay.
-Yeah.

175
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
Nice to see you.

176
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,840
Oh, and it was great to see you too.
And you look fantastic.

177
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,920
-Although you missed a button.
-Oh, actually, I..

178
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
Oh, okay, I see
what you're doing there.

179
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,440
I can't even believe this.
I really come off that badly?

180
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,280
It's okay. You calm down
after a while..

181
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,680
and then people see
how wonderful you are.

182
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,440
Good. Because I'm sure this
interview will last weeks.

183
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,800
All right, don't freak out, okay?
I will help you.

184
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,520
-How long before you have to leave?
-An hour.

185
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,160
-I can't help you.
-Phoebe..

186
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,600
We'll do our best. I'm the interviewer
and I'm meeting you for the first time.

187
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,720
-Okay.
-Hi. Come on in. I'm Regina Phalanges.

188
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,600
-Chandler Bing.
-Oh, Bing.

189
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,440
-What an unusual name.
-You should meet my Uncle Bada.

190
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,880
I'll let myself out.

191
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Your alfredo's dry.
Did you use your cheese?

192
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,040
When you say "use," do you mean
"eat as a pre-cooking snack"?

193
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,760
-And the cream?
-Cheese makes me thirsty.

194
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,920
-Okay. Let's move on.
-All right.

195
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,680
Something smells good
over at Monica's station.

196
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,480
My God! This is amazing!
You've never made this before?

197
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,240
Oh, no. I don't know anything
about cooking.

198
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,120
I had to ask what it was called when
the water makes those bubbles.

199
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,080
-Hats off to the chef.
-Your mouth was full. I didn't hear.

200
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,200
-Hats off to who?
-The chef!

201
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,640
That's right!

202
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,800
You'll find that I don't micromanage.
I don't shy away from delegating.

203
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,440
That's good to know. But let's stop
focusing on what you don't do..

204
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,640
and focus on what you do do.

205
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,000
What I do do..

206
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,840
is create an atmosphere of support
for the people working with me.

207
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,600
Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.

208
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,320
-Hardest thing I've ever done.
-Oh, you gotta go!

209
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,120
-Don't worry. You're ready.
-Really?

210
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,600
Absolutely! Just fight all your
natural instincts, and you'll be great.

211
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,960
Monica, check these out.

212
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,720
Those look like cookies.

213
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,880
I know, yeah.
And I made them all by myself.

214
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,880
I mixed the ingredients,
I put them in the oven, I took them out.

215
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,320
Granted, I should have used
the oven mitts, but still.

216
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,800
Monica, my star student.

217
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,040
You called me that before,
so I fashioned a star out of foil.

218
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,400
Now, no pressure. If you like my
cookies, you give me the star.

219
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,160
Wow, a star!

220
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,960
I know you all hate me,
and I'm sorry, but I don't care.

221
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,600
-Okay, Joey, you're up next.
-Yeah.

222
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

223
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,360
You get an A.

224
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,040
I got an A? In school?
Hey, I'm a dork!

225
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Joey, I'm so proud of you.

226
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,600
-I think you should give him your star.
-Excuse me?

227
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,040
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-Nobody knows what they're doing.

228
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,280
I do. I'm a professional chef!

229
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,400
Oh, relax. It's not a courtroom drama.

230
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,320
Why are you taking
Introduction to Cooking?

231
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,160
Yeah!

232
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,240
I'm sorry. I cook at this restaurant,
Allessandro's..

233
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,480
and I just got a bad review.

234
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,440
-Allessandro's? I love that place!
-You do?

235
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,680
You're a great chef.
As a person you're a little..

236
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,560
-Oh, I'm crazy, but you liked the food?
-Very much.

237
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,960
Okay, then. I don't stink.
I'm a good chef! Okay.

238
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,480
I don't want to go. I'm having fun.

239
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,240
Did either of you pay for this class?

240
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,200
Hey, if my friend says
it's time to go, it's time to go!

241
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,920
I was the point person on my company's
transition from the KL5 to GR6 systems.

242
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,320
-You must have had your hands full.
-That I did. That I did.

243
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,440
So let's talk a little bit
about your duties.

244
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,040
My duties?

245
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,320
All right.

246
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,760
You'll be heading a whole division,
so you'll have a lot of duties.

247
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,200
-I see.
-But there'll be 30 people under you..

248
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,280
so you can dump
a certain amount on them.

249
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,160
-Good to know.
-We could go into detail..

250
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,240
No, don't, I beg of you.

251
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,160
All right. We'll have a definite
answer for you on Monday.

252
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,320
But I can say with some
confidence, you'll fit in well here.

253
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,480
-Really?
-Absolutely.

254
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,440
-You can relax. You did great.
-Yeah, thanks.

255
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,400
I was really nervous.
I'm told I come on too strongly.

256
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,560
And then it was really hard
to sidestep that "duty" thing.

257
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,560
Duties?

258
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,480
Doodies?

259
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,400
Poo?

260
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,760
Poo?

261
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,160
Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay?
The interview was over.

262
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,000
That was the real Chandler Bing.
This is some crazy guy.

263
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Call security! There's a crazy guy
out in the hall!

264
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Poo?

265
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,040
I'll look forward to your call.

266
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
-Hey.
-Hey.

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,080
-You're back.
-How are you?

268
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,400
I'm fine. But that's not important.
What's important is how was she?

269
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,040
It was fun.
We just had coffee.

270
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,680
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee,
a little rub-rub-rub under the table?

271
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
What's going on?
Do you not like Katie?

272
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,320
No. No, she was nice. I mean,
she was a little slutty, but who isn't?

273
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,680
Well, I liked her.

274
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,600
Of course you did. You'd date a gorilla
if it called you Indiana Jones.

275
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,360
Did you get a fresh batch
of pregnancy hormones today?

276
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,000
No. It's just that..
Katie bothered me.

277
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,840
Why? What was wrong with her?

278
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,400
There was nothing wrong with her.
She was lovely.

279
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,480
-Okay. So, what's the matter?
-I don't want you to date her.

280
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,880
Why? What, are you jealous?

281
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,840
Yes. And not because
I want you to go out with me.

282
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,440
Because I don't want you
to go out with anybody.

283
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,360
It's terrible to even think this
and it's inappropriate..

284
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,440
but I want you to be at my constant
beck and call, 24 hours a day.

285
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm very sorry, but that is
just the way that I feel.

286
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,840
-Okay.
-What?

287
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,960
I won't date. I'll..

288
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,880
I'll be here with you all the time.

289
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,600
Really?

290
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,440
But I'm being so unreasonable.

291
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,680
True, but you're allowed to be
unreasonable. You're having our baby.

292
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,800
Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.

293
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,840
You feel better?

294
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,960
No, not really. You're pressing
the baby into my bladder..

295
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,400
and now I have to pee.

296
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,760
-Okay.
-Rach?

297
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,080
-Yeah?
-Just one thing..

298
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,560
We live together. You're having our
baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else.

299
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,520
Are you sure you don't want
something more?

300
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,760
Wow. I don't know, maybe..

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,400
Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.

302
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,680
-Like you did when I had to pee?
-Oh! I knew that.

303
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,920
I knew that!
I was just messing with you too!

304
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,080
Okay. Because for a minute
you seemed..

305
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,240
-No, it's just..
-Like you actually..

306
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
That's just because I'm such
a good messer!

307
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,440
-Rach?
-Yeah?

308
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,040
-The bathroom?
-Right.

309
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
I had a great time. I learned how to bake,
ate great food.

310
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,680
It's my first A since 7th grade and
I didn't even sleep with the teacher.

311
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,160
-Oh, look. Acting for Beginners.
-Yeah.

312
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,920
-Wanna feel good about yourself?
-What the hell!

313
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,480
Let's start with some basics.

314
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,120
Can anybody tell me what the difference
between upstage and downstage is?

315
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,680
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
