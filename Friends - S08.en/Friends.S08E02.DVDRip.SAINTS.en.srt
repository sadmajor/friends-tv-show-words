1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,160
Listen, sir, for the last time,
I don't care what the computer says.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,440
We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts
from the minibar.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,200
And we did not watch
Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,560
-Joey, were you in our room last night?
-No.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,720
I was told the name of the movie
would not appear on the bill.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,520
-We're checking out of the bridal suite.
-That's right, I'm no longer a bride.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,720
I'll never be a bride again.
Now I'm just someone's wife.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,880
And I'm the happiest guy in the world.

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,200
Honey, don't be upset. We still have
so much to look forward to.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,680
Yeah, right.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,760
-We got the honeymoon.
-That's not till Thursday.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,320
-The wedding pictures.
-It won't be ready for weeks.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,960
Not the disposable cameras
from the tables.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,080
That's true.
I knew I married you for a reason!

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,160
Tell you what, I will go get them
developed, and you can go home.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,600
-What? What did you take a picture of?
-Nothing.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,360
It was something.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,000
Ross has the cameras.
Has he checked out yet?

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,240
Are you joking?
Checkout is not till noon.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,520
-And he has a good 11 minutes left.
-So?

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,840
So Ross had never checked out of a room
a minute before he had to.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,720
One time, when we were dating,
we got a late checkout.

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,160
He got so excited,
it was the best sex we ever had.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,920
Until he screamed out "Radisson"
at the end.

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,240
Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross,
get the cameras and get them developed.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,800
32, Joe. You're 32!

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,400
-Here's a copy of your bill.
-Thanks.

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,840
Champagne, strawberries..

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,320
Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler
ordered porn on our wedding night.

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,800
Yeah, that's sad.
Mashuga Nut?

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,200
I have six minutes left!

32
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
It's me.

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,680
Soaps, shampoos.
Are you really taking all this stuff?

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,760
Why not?
It's built into the price of the room.

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,520
Yeah, but you don't need..
What is this?

36
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,320
Thread.

37
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,040
Score!

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,280
-Where are the disposable cameras?
-What cameras?

39
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,320
-Last night I asked you to take them.
-No, you didn't.

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,640
Yes, remember?
Right before we cut the cake, I said..

41
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,200
Yeah, you asked me
if I could do you a favor.

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,320
Then my Uncle Murray came up to you
and handed you a check.

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,600
Then you said, "Why is it called
a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,440
Then you did that,
and my Uncle Murray looked at me like:

45
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,320
-So you don't have the cameras?
-No, sorry.

46
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,080
So, what? They're gone?
Monica's gonna freak!

47
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sure they're here somewhere.
I'll help you look.

48
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,320
-Great.
-In three minutes.

49
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,520
Are you gonna open the presents
without Chandler?

50
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,560
No! I'm just..

51
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,560
They're calling out to me. This
little guy even crawled up in my lap.

52
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,520
Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just
one present. What do you think it is?

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,760
A little mirror that,
when you look into it..

54
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,600
you see yourself as an old woman.

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,840
A tiny salt shaker!

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,760
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

57
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Oh, wow! Okay. Well, that was fun.
That was fun.

58
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,280
Okay, I'll just wait for Chandler
to open up the rest of them.

59
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,080
Although, you know, this is part
of a salt-and-pepper set.

60
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,640
It may just count as only half
a present. What do you think?

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,000
I guess it's okay to open one more if it's
part of a set. It's probably this one.

62
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,840
Or this one!

63
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,360
-How are you? Got any morning sickness?
-The guys don't know yet, do they?

64
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,880
Joey and Ross don't know anything.
Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

65
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,080
That's right.
Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.

66
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,200
He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling
or offered to carry my bags.

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
I feel bad for the woman
who ends up with him.

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,480
After you, of course.

69
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't worry. You only have to be
pregnant for a few more hours..

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,040
because I'm telling the father today.

71
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,080
Is it someone in the building?
That tall guy on the first floor?

72
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,880
-No!
-What? I think he's cute.

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,240
-Then you have his baby.
-Believe me, I'm trying.

74
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,760
It's so weird.
You're gonna tell this guy today..

75
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,400
and he has no idea
what's gonna happen.

76
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,400
You're just gonna knock on his door
and change his life forever.

77
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,880
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,680
Or the raw sexual magnetism.

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
Yeah, well, I guess
it is pretty big news.

80
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,680
Pretty big? It's huge!
God, this guy doesn't have a clue.

81
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,600
He's just walking down the street thinking,
"I had sex with Rachel Greene. I rock!"

82
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,080
Then, bam! He's a father,
everything's different.

83
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,240
It's only different if he wants it to be.
I'm not gonna ask him for anything.

84
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
He still has this huge decision
to make.

85
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,480
Now he's walking around thinking,
"Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam!

86
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,320
What was that "bam"?

87
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,040
I don't know.
He's hit by a bus, or something.

88
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,520
Joey, what would you do if someone you
slept with told you she was pregnant?

89
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,200
Who called here?

90
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,920
Did she sound blond? Did she have
an accent? I gotta make a call.

91
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,960
Should have never walked
into that Sunglass Hut!

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's not you!
You didn't get anybody pregnant.

93
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,480
Why would you scare me like that?
What the hell's going on?

94
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,800
Is somebody pregnant?

95
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,680
Oh, yeah! That's me.

96
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,840
Oh, my God, Pheebs!
You're gonna have a baby?

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,680
Yes, I am.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!

98
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,360
-Wait a minute, who's the father?
-You don't know him.

99
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,880
It's not important. He wants nothing
to do with me or the baby.

100
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,040
Who is this guy? Because I will
track him down and kick his ass!

101
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,480
-David Linn.
-David Linn!

102
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,720
-Who's David Linn?
-Some guy from my gym. Little annoying.

103
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,960
-Chandler?
-Did you find the cameras?

104
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,800
-No. Did you?
-Yes.

105
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,920
That's why I'm under the table,
celebrating.

106
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,880
I checked in the lost and found. I talked
to the manager. No one's turned them in.

107
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,760
Great. Those cameras were the only thing
that was gonna cheer Monica up today.

108
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,600
You just got married.
Why is she so depressed?

109
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,920
All my energy is going
into not asking that question.

110
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,000
-I can't believe I screwed this up!
-I'm sorry, man.

111
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,000
Here's a thought.
This is the same ballroom.

112
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,520
There's a band. There's gonna be
plenty of dressed-up people.

113
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Are you suggesting
we dance our troubles away?

114
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,360
No, I'm saying we buy more of these
at the gift shop..

115
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,920
throw our tuxes back on
and take a few pictures.

116
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
We just have to make sure
not to get anybody's faces.

117
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,520
Are you serious?

118
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,960
I'm thinking about
your new bride at home.

119
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,160
Do you want to start your life together
by letting her down?

120
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,240
Marriage advice? Really?

121
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,160
I'm telling you,
this looks exactly like your wedding.

122
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,400
-Aren't these the same flowers?
-I don't know. Monica picked them.

123
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
-What about the chairs?
-Those too.

124
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,520
-The place settings?
-Her.

125
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,720
-What did you do?
-I was in charge of the cameras.

126
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,520
Gift shop?

127
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,280
-Did you do it yet?
-Not yet.

128
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,000
Then what are you doing here?
Are you about to do it?

129
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,920
Is it Gunther?

130
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,000
-It's not Gunther!
-Thank God. Because that hair on a baby?

131
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,760
The father is not here, okay?
I haven't told him yet.

132
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,200
-I don't think I can tell him at all now.
-Why not?

133
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,880
I was walking down the street, thinking,
"I'm gonna tell the father." And then, bam!

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,440
Bus?

135
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,600
No, you! You freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this all is.

136
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,040
But it is huge.

137
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,520
I know. But I was just thinking about
how huge it was for me.

138
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,400
I didn't even go to how huge it'll be
for the father.

139
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,000
You're thinking about this way too much.
Just tell him and get it over with.

140
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,200
It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,
quick and painless. Watch.

141
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,200
Oh, mother of..!

142
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,040
See?

143
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,280
-Are we opening presents?
-No. I shouldn't have even opened these.

144
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,240
Joey, I am out of control!
You have to do me a favor.

145
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,640
No matter what I say,
no matter what I do..

146
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,720
please, do not let me open
another present. Okay?

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,760
Give me one more.

148
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,760
Oh, good, you're here.
Pheebs? Listen..

149
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,400
-Sit down, I got something I wanna say.
-All right.

150
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,280
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

151
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,080
I've always felt that you
and I have a special bond.

152
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,680
So..

153
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,400
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

154
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh, my God!

155
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,560
Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.

156
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,400
-You can't marry him!
-Hey, lady, your day's over. It's my turn.

157
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,840
-Why can't she marry me?
-I can and I will.

158
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,720
She's not pregnant.
Rachel's the one who's pregnant.

159
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,720
Oh, my God!

160
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
He'd notice when you didn't
have a baby in nine months!

161
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,240
It's Joey!

162
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,920
I love you.

163
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,320
Wait, I can't believe it!
Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?

164
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
We don't know.

165
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,520
-I wonder if it's that dude.
-There's a dude?

166
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,120
Who is it?

167
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,360
About a month ago
this guy spent the night with Rachel.

168
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,880
I didn't see who it was, but..

169
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,120
Was that story over?

170
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,720
The guy left this.

171
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,320
Oh, my God!
I know who the father is.

172
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,080
People have got
to finish their stories.

173
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,360
Hello.

174
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,840
I don't know if we're both in.
Come closer.

175
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,120
Nice aftershave.

176
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,480
If you want some,
I've got eight mini bottles in my bag.

177
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,320
-Excuse me, could you take a picture of us?
-Of course.

178
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,640
Would you take one of us?

179
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,280
Yeah, sure.

180
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,880
Click.

181
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,400
-It didn't click.
-I heard it.

182
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,880
-But there was no flash.
-Why won't you take our picture?

183
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,600
Oh, yeah. I'll take your picture.

184
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,360
Your finger was covering the lens.

185
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,400
Who are you, Ansel Adams?
Get out of here!

186
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,160
Look, I feel really bad about
how I freaked you out before..

187
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,360
so I asked the father to meet you here
so you could tell him.

188
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,440
What? Wait a minute.
How do you even know who the father is?

189
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,720
I may play the fool at times..

190
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,360
but I'm more than a pretty blond girl
with an ass that won't quit.

191
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,320
I believe this belongs
to the father of your baby..

192
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,360
Oh, God. He's in there right now?

193
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,120
You can turn around, or you can go rip
the Band-Aid off. What do you want to do?

194
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,720
-Let's rip.
-Are you sure?

195
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,160
-Phoebe!
-Okay. Sorry.

196
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,440
Hey, Rach.

197
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,280
Why don't you go up on-stage.
I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.

198
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,280
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre
please see the front desk?

199
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,600
Your car is about to be towed.

200
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,160
That's my car!

201
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,240
-A '95 LeSabre?
-Yes.

202
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,120
-A green LeSabre?
-Yes!

203
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,440
-I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
-Yes, green-blue.

204
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,880
Well, go. Go move it!

205
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,280
Ready for the last picture?
Get ready to run.

206
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,240
Congratulations on your wedding.

207
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,280
So, what's this about?

208
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,880
Rachel has something
she wants to tell you.

209
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,120
And I believe that
this is your red sweater.

210
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,200
No, this is my red sweater.

211
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,240
Oh, no.

212
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,880
Could I get anyone a coffee?

213
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,200
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

214
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,520
What's going on, Rach?

215
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,880
Nothing.
Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

216
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,000
But you do wear that sweater a lot.
Are you involved in some kind of dare?

217
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,800
I'm actually glad Phoebe called.

218
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
I know we broke up because you thought
I was immature, but I've grown up.

219
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,280
I think we should get back together.

220
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,000
It's just not the right time.

221
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,760
It is the right time.
I'm ready for more.

222
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,200
Come on, Rach.
Let's give it another try.

223
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,320
I'm having a baby.

224
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,480
-You can go.
-Thank you.

225
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,240
I don't know how
any of these got opened!

226
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,240
-You opened them all?
-I know, I am a terrible person.

227
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,120
Chandler's never gonna trust me
with anything ever again.

228
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,200
You got my parents' gift.

229
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,000
-What is that?
-I think it does something to salami.

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,280
-How'd it go?
-What did Tag say?

231
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,720
Tag is not the father.
And Joey knows now?

232
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,680
I do, Rach, I do.
And I am so happy for you.

233
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,640
Wow, you didn't even try
to unhook my bra.

234
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,200
-So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
-I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.

235
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,160
No matter what this guy says,
you're not gonna be alone in this.

236
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,040
-I'm not?
-No. Listen..

237
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,400
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

238
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,680
I've always felt like you and I have
this special bond, you know?

239
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,280
-Rachel Greene, will you marry me?
-What?

240
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
-What?
-What?!

241
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,120
-Pheebs, give me the ring back.
-No!

242
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,480
Joey, you're so sweet, so sweet, honey.
But I'm not looking for a husband.

243
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,760
I understand.

244
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,440
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go and lie down.

245
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,440
What? I proposed to you.
It balances out.

246
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,440
I can't say that didn't hurt.

247
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,720
But I'll take you back, Joey Tribbiani.

248
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,200
-Listen, about that, I only offered..
-Ooh, a Salami Buddy!

249
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,760
There you go!

250
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,000
-We're back!
-Great.

251
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,520
We're hanging in the kitchen.
Let's stay in the kitchen.

252
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,840
-It's picture time.
-You're gonna love these.

253
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,120
Here's a picture of Ross.

254
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,760
And that's me.

255
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,080
And that's me and Ross.

256
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,360
And here's a picture of our first kiss
as a married couple.

257
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,720
Wow, that is a great picture. Yeah!

258
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,080
And interesting, because I found
the cameras in one of our bags.

259
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,560
Didn't see that coming.

260
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,680
So this isn't a picture
of our first kiss..

261
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,680
but it is a picture
of my first kiss with this lady.

262
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,760
Which, by the look on your face, I'm sure
you'll remember, so there's no need..

263
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,680
-I'll take the real pictures to get developed.
-Good idea.

264
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,600
You opened all the presents without me?
We were gonna do that together.

265
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,960
You kissed another woman?!

266
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
-Call it even?
-Okay.

267
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,680
-I'm gonna go get these in some water.
-You stole those from that wedding?

268
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,920
No, the hotel lobby. They think they can
charge me for some dirty movie..

269
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,400
and a bag of Mashuga Nuts,
they got another thing coming!

270
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,000
Hey, my sweater!

271
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,360
I've been looking for this
for, like, a month.

272
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,960
Oh, my God!

273
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,280
Oh, my God!

274
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,560
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good. Long time no see.

275
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,000
-Like your sweater.
-Right back at you.

276
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,240
-It's crazy about Rachel.
-Well, she's one crazy lady.

277
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,680
-So whose is it?
-I don't know, some Italian guy.

278
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,200
Come on, read your own label.
See you later. He is so weird.
