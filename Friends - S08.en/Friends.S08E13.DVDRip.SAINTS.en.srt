1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,280
All right, it's a new day.
That stuff about Rachel?

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,880
You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
You're fine. You're better than fine.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,320
You are, as your friend Tony
would say, "Great!"

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,080
Everything's normal.
She's just your friend, Rachel.

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,720
Your friend, Rachel.
Your friend. Rachel.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,720
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!

7
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,760
Are you..? Are you high?

8
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,960
I just had the most amazing bath.

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
-Really? I don't like baths.
-You like them with me.

10
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,800
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
It's the wet, naked lady.

11
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,120
-Baths are so relaxing.
-Really? What do you do?

12
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,520
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.

13
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,600
How dirty do you think I am?

14
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,240
If you had some candles and bubbles
and music, you would love it.

15
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,480
It would take all of your stress away.

16
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,080
It's 2:00 on a Wednesday
and I'm watching Road Rules.

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,360
How stressed do you think I am?

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Hey, Chandler. You got a minute?
I really need to talk to you.

19
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh, yeah. Is this a cold-pizza talk
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
Well, neither.

21
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, my God, what's up?

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,560
I don't know. It's just..

23
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Lately, I've been feeling..

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,360
Okay, here's what it is.

25
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,920
You know what?
I feel a lot better. Thanks.

26
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,240
No. Come back here and talk to me,
mon frere.

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,640
-Who?
-Just come back.

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,960
Okay.

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,320
You and Monica,
friends for a long time.

30
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,840
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
But that's different. There are rules
there too, you know what I mean?

32
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,920
Do you?

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,400
It was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place, right?

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,720
-In London?
-Yeah.

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,320
Yes, when Monica and I were
in London, we were both in London.

36
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,720
You know what. This is a bad idea.
Forget all about it.

37
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,040
And listen, do me a favor,
this conversation between you and me.

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
If that.

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,080
How do I keep losing at tic-tac-toe?

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,040
Oh, no, no, honey.
My circle always stays in the middle.

41
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,360
Oh, Ross, don't forget we have
that doctor's appointment tomorrow.

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,600
-To find out the sex of the baby?
-No. We don't wanna know.

43
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,080
All we care about
is that it's happy and healthy.

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,440
Yep, happy and healthy. And cute.

45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,280
-And smart. With an aptitude for science.
-Popular.

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,400
Are you two talking
about the same baby?

47
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,360
-Hey, have you thought of names?
-Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch.

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,520
-Really? Me too.
-Me too.

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,800
Really?

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,760
If it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,320
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
to have a backup, you know?

52
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,720
-Rach, what were you thinking?
-Okay.

53
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,760
I was thinking if it's a girl..

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,160
how about Sandrene? It's French.

55
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,400
That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.

56
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,800
-Okay, fine. What do you have?
-It's for a boy.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,280
I know it's a little out there, but..

58
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
Darwin.

59
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,800
Oh, my God. Our child will be beaten
to death in the schoolyard.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
Yeah, by Sandrene.

61
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,320
You're saying that
because I said no to your name.

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm really, really not.

63
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,200
How about you each get five vetoes?

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,600
-That sounds fair.
-I don't think you'll need it. Check this out.

65
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,120
If it's a girl, Rain.

66
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
-Veto.
-Why?

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,480
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,120
I have my own kiln,
and my dress is made out of wheat."

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,760
I know her!

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,440
I bought a homemade soap
from her at a Dead show!

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,280
-Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
-Why do you hate our child?

72
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,320
-Fine, you go.
-Okay. James.

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
-But only if it's a girl.
-Veto.

74
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,440
I like Ruth. What about Ruth?

75
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,680
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we having an 89-year-old?

76
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,480
-How about Dayton?
-Veto. Stewart.

77
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,280
Veto. Sawyer.

78
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,720
-Veto. Helen.
-Veto.

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,880
Is it me, or is Veto starting
to sound really good?

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,120
Sex on the balcony?

82
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,640
No. But someone's not gonna
get over that idea.

83
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,480
-What is it?
-I drew you a bath.

84
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,480
I don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of us having sex on the balcony?

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,360
Please. Will you just try it for me.
I used all my best stuff.

86
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,680
I lit candles, I put on music.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

87
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,880
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,040
-This does butch it up a bit.
-I swear, if you try it, you will love it.

89
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,200
If I do this, can we at least discuss
sex on the balcony?

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,640
Absolutely.

91
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,680
But I know how
that discussion's gonna go.

92
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,160
All right, this isn't so bad.
I like the flowery smell.

93
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Which is okay,
because I've got my boat.

94
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,560
I can actually feel my tension
just melting away.

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I could fall asleep in here.

96
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,200
I could drown in here.

97
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Drowning.

98
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,320
-So?
-Oh, my God.

99
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,840
I told you you were a bath person.
Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.

100
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,880
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

101
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,960
I don't think you had an open mind
about the name Ruth.

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,280
I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller?
How cute is that?

103
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,520
Oh, my God, I can practically
hear the mahjong tiles.

104
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,880
Okay. All your tests look fine. Are you
interested in knowing the sex of the baby?

105
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,960
-No, we're not.
-But you have it right there in that file?

106
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,240
You could tell us
whether it's a boy or a girl?

107
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,680
Dayton or Sandrene?
Phoebe or Pheebo?

108
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,240
That's right.
But if you don't wanna know..

109
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,040
-No, we wanna wait. Right?
-Right. Right.

110
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,320
Oh, I'll be right back.

111
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,480
I know it's really not my place..

112
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,000
but please don't name
your child Pheebo.

113
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,040
So which of these babies
do you think is the ugliest?

114
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,080
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

115
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,040
They're babies.
They're all beautiful.

116
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,520
-Third one from the left?
-Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

117
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,320
I think it knows I'm talking about it.
Don't you..? You're looking!

118
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,920
-I didn't!
-I saw you!

119
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,520
Fine, I did,
but I didn't see anything.

120
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,160
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

121
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,680
-Okay. But listen to me, I didn't..
-Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,320
I couldn't even if I wanted to,
because I don't know!

123
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,200
I swear I didn't see anything! I don't want
to know. It was just a momentary lapse.

124
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,400
Momentary lapse?
Don't you have any self-control?

125
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,840
Okay. A couple months late
on the lecture, Ross.

126
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,520
Hello?

127
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,520
I'm in the bathroom. Can you come in here?
I think there's something wrong.

128
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,720
You know what?
I think I'll wait out here.

129
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm in the bathtub.

130
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,480
-What's wrong?
-I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong.

131
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,160
The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve
and is now lodged places.

132
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,080
And the scents I used don't compliment
each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile?

133
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,640
-What?
-Bath salts.

134
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,120
They're starting to effervesce.

135
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,600
It's different.

136
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,640
It's interesting.

137
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,680
Okay. Let's talk about something else.

138
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,600
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?

139
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,880
I actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.

140
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,520
He was talking about rules
and right and wrong.

141
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,640
-I had the same conversation.
-You did? What was he talking about?

142
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,080
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since we saw him in Macbeth.

143
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,400
That was a long night.

144
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,720
All right, let's break this down.
What exactly did he say to you?

145
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,840
He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.

146
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,240
-He didn't say that to me.
-What'd he tell you?

147
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,440
He was asking questions
about you, me and London.

148
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,000
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.

149
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,640
Okay. So you, me and London.

150
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,000
Looking at people differently.

151
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,200
Maybe he wants to do what you and I
did in London with someone.

152
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,680
But what'd he mean by "rules"?

153
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,480
Wait. He stopped talking
the minute Phoebe came in.

154
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,680
-Because he was looking at her differently.
-And Phoebe is his friend.

155
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,920
So he thinks that would be
breaking the rules.

156
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,240
My God, he wants to do it
with Phoebe in London!

157
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,600
-You guys?
-Just a minute!

158
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,960
-That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
-You don't say anything.

159
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,080
Why would I say anything?

160
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,640
That two of our friends could start
the greatest love affair of their lives?

161
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,360
They would have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!

162
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,560
-I'm not gonna let you say anything.
-You just stay here.

163
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,840
Oh, God!

164
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,520
Hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.

165
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,120
Oh, you had that? I thought I lost it.
I got a new one a month ago.

166
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,360
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.

167
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,720
-What?
-Nothing.

168
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,600
I really shouldn't say.
I'm really not supposed to.

169
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,040
Fine.

170
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,800
It's a humdinger.

171
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,840
Well, then it's really too bad
that you can't tell me.

172
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,360
Somebody likes you!

173
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,800
Is it Chandler?

174
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
-No!
-Then tell him to stop staring.

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,160
It's Joey.

176
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,880
Really? Joey? You don't say.

177
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,280
-Is it something you'd be interested in?
-I don't know, I don't know.

178
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,440
You know, I mean, on the one hand,
"Mother, may I?"

179
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,360
But, you know, on the other hand..

180
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,800
No. No, I can't. We're friends.

181
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,560
Oh, no. I don't wanna risk
what we have.

182
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,840
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?

183
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,800
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.

184
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,240
Well, I must say, I am on fire!
First Chandler, now Joey.

185
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,120
-Not Chandler. Just Joey.
-Sure.

186
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,840
You know what? I've been thinking about it.
I'm coming around on the name Ruth.

187
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,640
I think I would actually consider
naming our child that.

188
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,480
Rach, I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

189
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,320
Wait a minute.

190
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,560
Wait a minute. You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?

191
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,320
Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.

192
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,280
You did see. You know it's a boy!

193
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,640
I didn't see anything.
I actually changed my mind about the name.

194
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,600
I don't think so.
You're giving me Ruth..

195
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,920
so you get to name him
when it's a boy.

196
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,800
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
I would.. Sequoia!

198
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,280
-Veto.
-Fine.

199
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,920
Unless..

200
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,040
you anticipated
that I would figure all this out..

201
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,480
and you know that
it actually is a girl.

202
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,040
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.

203
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,680
Well, I'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!

204
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,600
-But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
-Not like this!

205
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,600
What's up?

206
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,800
-Joey, I know.
-What?

207
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,680
-I know.
-What?

208
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,800
-I know about your feelings.
-Oh, my God, you do?

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sorry. Things worked out for
Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.

210
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,200
I know. And this is so much more
complicated than it was for those guys.

211
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,760
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

212
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,720
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

213
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,880
I know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.

214
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,760
She's my pregnant friend
who's Ross 'ex!

215
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,040
Yeah, that's Rachel.

216
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,880
Beat me over the head with it.

217
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,760
What am I gonna do? I keep trying
to get rid of these feelings.

218
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,600
I stayed up all last night and made a list
of everything I don't like about her.

219
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,560
-You wanna hear it?
-Yeah.

220
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,760
"She made me switch to light mayo."
That's it! That's all I got!

221
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,200
You know what? Tastes the same
and my pants fit better.

222
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,760
Joey, I think you're getting upset for
nothing. This is probably just a crush.

223
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,360
You think?

224
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,280
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but then it goes away.

225
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,800
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. It's a crush!

226
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,800
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.

227
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,760
There you go.
Crushes happen all the time.

228
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,440
I know I've had them for all you guys.
Except for Ross and Chandler.

229
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,000
-And I'm sure you've had them for us.
-Not really.

230
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,280
Throw me a bone here.

231
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,160
So I called the doctor.

232
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,720
-Now we both know the sex of the baby.
-What?

233
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,880
That's right.
The student has become the master.

234
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,800
-Ross, I swear. I don't know.
-Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,400
A what?

236
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,880
You really didn't know?

237
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,480
-We're having a girl?
-No.

238
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,480
-That's what you said.
-No.

239
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,640
-You said girl.
-Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

240
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm not! We're having a girl!

241
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,120
Sometimes I can't believe it's with you,
but still, we're having a girl!

242
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,480
I know! You know what?
I'm putting Ruth back on the table.

243
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,840
Yes, we'll have ourselves
a little baby Ruth.

244
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,560
-Permission to veto.
-Yes, please.

245
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,720
Do I smell essential oils?

246
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,280
Yeah. I'm gonna take a bath.
I was just gonna get a magazine.

247
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,200
What do you think you're doing?

248
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,280
Leaving my troubles behind?

249
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,360
I know that you're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

250
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,080
It's so hard to care
when you're this relaxed.

251
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,120
Okay, fine. You can have the bath,
but I am taking your boat.

252
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,320
Now you're just a girl in a tub.

253
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,600
Hi, bubbles. Manly.

254
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,520
I thought I would drop by
and let you know how it went.

255
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
You told her?

256
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,040
She pulled it out of me!
She's like a conversational wizard!

257
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,960
-How did it go?
-You were wrong. He doesn't like me.

258
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,320
How would you like it if I sent you
to Lee Majors' house..

259
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,520
and I told you he liked you
and you went there..

260
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,680
and you found out that he didn't like you.
How would you feel?

261
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,040
-I don't think I'd care.
-Really? Lee Majors is hot.

262
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,640
-Hello?
-We're in the bathroom!

263
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,040
-Why?
-Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!

264
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,960
-What are you guys doing in here?
-Oh, my God.

265
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,600
A friend he's looking at differently,
but it's wrong.

266
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,120
-It's Rachel!
-You like Rachel?

267
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,000
It's no big deal. Phoebe and I talked.
It's a crush. It'll go away.

268
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,160
Dude, you gotta rearrange
your bubbles.

269
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,160
Mazel tov.

270
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,960
Ross and I were looking for you.

271
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,280
What are we all doing in here?
Oh, my.

272
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,760
-Honey, cover it up with the boat.
-It's not an aircraft carrier.

273
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,320
Hello?

274
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,320
We're all in here,
and we'd love for you to join us!

275
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,920
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.

276
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,480
-Did you tell them?
-No. I was waiting for you.

277
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,080
-Tell us what?
-We're having a girl.

278
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,720
Oh, wow! Really?

279
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,600
I'll get you later.

280
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,120
All right. It's a new day.
And it's just a crush.

281
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
That's all. Just a little crush.

282
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,840
All that worrying I was doing?
That was crazy.

283
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,840
Like my friend the bird here
would say, "It was cuckoo!"

284
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,200
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's just a crush.

285
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,520
-Hi, sweetie.
-I love you.

286
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,240
It's nice to do this together,
isn't it?

287
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,880
Yeah. And what you're doing
feels so good.

288
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,960
I'm not touching you.

289
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,320
-You're not?
-It's the salts.

290
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,760
Oh, sweet Lord,
new realms of pleasure.

291
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,120
Whatever keeps you
off the balcony, big guy.
