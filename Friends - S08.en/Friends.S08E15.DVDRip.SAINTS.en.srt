1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,160
-Oh! Hey, Rach!
-Hi.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,040
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,720
How's living at Ross'?

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,320
It's good, except he makes us watch
the Discovery Channel all day long.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,760
Something really boring happened
to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,320
Oh, thank you.
I'll see you guys later.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,080
That is one lucky
to-go cup of coffee.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,600
I wish you would get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,320
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,280
Thanks. Maybe later.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,640
-Gunther, can I get a scone?
-Want anything?

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,920
I want a lot of things.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,760
I wanna be with the woman I love
on Valentine's Day.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,840
I want her to love me back.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,560
And I want relief from the wrenching
pain of knowing that won't happen!

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,160
We have red bagels.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,160
Okay.

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,920
So how do you guys
like living together so far?

19
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,720
-Oh, it's been good.
-Yeah.

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,240
Except Ross is more uptight
about crumbs than you are.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,880
There was a drumstick in the couch.

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,480
And I am not uptight about crumbs.

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,040
It's just that, you know..

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,040
crumbs attract mice.
And mice leave droppings.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,040
And that's how the plague started.

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,720
So you wanna relive that again..

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,880
Mice didn't start the plague.

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,200
Rats did.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,600
Rattus norvegicus, to be exact.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Oh, good God, Ross.

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,080
Nick at Nite, once in a while.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,760
All right, I'm going.
Bye.

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,120
Phoebe, will you wait here?

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
-I wanna get your opinion on something.
-Yeah.

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,680
How does Mona feel about
Rachel moving in?

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
I'm on my way to tell her.

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,000
She's been away all week,
but she'll be cool.

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,840
She's been so supportive.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,360
She even got the baby a T-shirt
that says "Fossils are my friends."

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,520
Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,600
So I'm gonna take off.

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,760
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
Rachel wanted to see this tape.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,600
-What is it?
-My friend giving birth.

44
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,400
Could you take it to your apartment?

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,440
"Candy and Cookie"?

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,160
Candy's the mom,
Cookie's the daughter.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
The father's name is also Cookie.

48
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,240
Why am I friends with these people?

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,080
Phoebe, come here.

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,240
I wanna show you
something in the bathroom.

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,960
Monica, grow up.

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,480
-What's behind your back?
-Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,400
-You don't want my opinion?
-Not really.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,280
Come on, I'm your older brother.
Ask me.

55
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,200
Okay, big brother.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,600
Which one would make your best friend
want to do your little sister?

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,640
The red one.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,000
Hey.

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,520
I know you're depressed,
so I brought someone to cheer you up.

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,160
Right outside is a real,
live, furry playmate.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm not sleeping
with your friend Jane again.

62
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,080
Hey, a dog!

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,600
Who, you gotta admit,
looks a lot like Jane.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,400
He's the happiest dog ever.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
So you can keep him
till he cheers you up.

66
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,000
I borrow him myself
from time to time..

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,960
when I get depressed
thinking about..

68
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,600
world hunger, poverty..

69
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,440
Not to trivialize your pain.

70
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,680
Thanks so much, Pheebs.
We are gonna have so much fun!

71
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,760
Oh, not that kind of fun.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
Happy Valentine's!

73
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,320
I'm slipping into something a bit less
comfortable and a bit more slutty.

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,360
"Candy and Cookie"?

75
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,880
"Candy and Cookie"?!

76
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,360
Monica got me porn?

77
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,520
Girl-on-girl porn?!

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,720
She really must love me!

79
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,360
-Yeah, just relax.
-I love you, St. Valentine.

80
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,400
Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.

81
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,000
Now push!

82
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,480
Oh, God, it hurts!

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,920
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!

84
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
-Oh, make it stop!
-I am trying!

85
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!

86
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,560
You're cute, but you're not too smart.

87
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,680
Did I just throw this?

88
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
-Hi.
-Hi.

89
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,920
I accidentally packed these
with my stuff.

90
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,200
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,640
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.

92
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,680
You are so cute. I wish I could play,
but I've gotta go to work.

93
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,120
I hope I stop talking like this
before my meeting. Yes, I do.

94
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,880
Bye-bye, Joey.
Seriously, I can't stop it.

95
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
Come here! Hey!

96
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,080
That's Rachel. She used to live here.

97
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,080
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.

98
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,840
But we can't have her.

99
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,600
I really miss her.

100
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,720
Hey, you understand, right?
You're a guy.

101
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,640
Well, you used to be.

102
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,640
So, what do you think?

103
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,400
I've still got it.

104
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,000
-Why did you get me this?
-What is it?

105
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,840
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.

106
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,320
Oh, the dilating!

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,160
Is this the video of the birth? It's
Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?

108
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,520
I thought maybe you got me porn
for Valentine's Day.

109
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,040
If you thought I was gonna
get you porn for Valentine's Day..

110
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,120
you were right.

111
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,280
It's about a girl who moves
to the city in search of stardom..

112
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,680
but ends up having sex
with a lot of guys.

113
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,280
It got four stars.

114
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,800
Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.

115
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,080
-Anyway, you wanna take a look?
-Well..

116
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,280
-I'm not really in a sexy mood.
-Hey, what's going on?

117
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,280
Remember the first time
you saw Jaws..

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,360
how long it took
to go back in the water?

119
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,120
We can't let this tape
wreck Valentine's Day.

120
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
You gotta get past it.

121
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,440
Just get back on the horse.

122
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,400
Otherwise, the horse is gonna go into the
bedroom and change into her sweatpants.

123
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,560
-Okay, you don't know. You didn't
see it. -Childbirth is beautiful.

124
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,160
Oh, beautiful? Really?

125
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,760
You think this is beautiful?

126
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,080
Oh, my God!
No wonder my mother hates me!

127
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,640
-See, honey, there's..
-Don't touch me!

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,520
-Hi!
-Hey!

129
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,640
-How was Atlantic City?
-Good.

130
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,280
I brought you back a present.

131
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,240
You didn't have to..

132
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,640
Saltwater taffy?!

133
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,320
Thanks.

134
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,280
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater.

135
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,560
It's actually made
with salted fresh water.

136
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,440
That's not interesting.

137
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,920
-I think it's interesting.
-Me too. I missed you!

138
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,040
Me too.

139
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,000
-How was your week?
-Good.

140
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,480
-The baby started kicking.
-How exciting!

141
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,320
It was amazing. The only thing is,
I wasn't there the first time.

142
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,440
-Oh, no.
-I was missing out on all this stuff.

143
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,480
-Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
-Yeah, right.

144
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.

145
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,280
"Have your ex-wife move in.
That wouldn't be awkward."

146
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,280
Imagine, I go away for a few days..

147
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,200
and my boyfriend is living
with a woman he got pregnant.

148
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,240
So, what'd you tell him?

149
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,800
You didn't tell Mona
Rachel moved in?

150
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,480
She seemed to think
it was such a crazy idea.

151
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,600
Plus, she got me taffy.

152
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,520
-Really? I've never had any.
-Ever?

153
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,400
My mom was too busy planning her
suicide to provide saltwater treats.

154
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
Thank you.

155
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,200
Are you gonna tell her?

156
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,000
I will. I want to butter her up first.

157
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,520
I'm gonna take her to dinner,
do all this romantic stuff.

158
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,800
When she thinks
I'm the best boyfriend ever..

159
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,880
I'll tell her my pregnant
ex-girlfriend is living with me.

160
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,800
If I haven't said it before,
she's a lucky, lucky lady.

161
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,640
So where are..?
What the crap is up with this stuff?

162
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,280
Is it gum? Is it food?
What's the deal?

163
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh, it's nice.
May I try a pink one?

164
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,840
So I just have to plan
the perfect night.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,960
Hey, what's the best date
you ever had?

166
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,560
Last year, Greg Hayman took me
to a very nice sushi dinner.

167
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,520
Then we took a romantic walk
to a nearby research lab..

168
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,160
where we trashed the place
and freed 20 monkeys.

169
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,760
I knew it!
I knew I wasn't crazy!

170
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,640
Last year, a monkey
did attack me at the bus stop!

171
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,320
So between her and me being friends,
and her history with Ross..

172
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,520
it just isn't gonna happen.

173
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,840
It'd be like you falling in love
with a cat.

174
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,200
-Hey.
-Hey.

175
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,920
How's my favorite dog, huh?
How's my favorite dog?

176
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,400
You're subdued.

177
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,240
-Did you give him a beer?
-No.

178
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,240
-Will you excuse us? We need to talk.
-Sure.

179
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,320
Oh, me, right.

180
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,560
-He's miserable. What happened to him?
-Nothing.

181
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,080
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?

182
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,600
Rachel stuff.

183
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,360
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
This is the happiest dog in the world.

184
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
He spends a day with you, and look!

185
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,480
He's breathing.

186
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,800
Okay, well, he's watching us
so just look happy, okay?

187
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,840
-I'll take him to Wendy's.
-He's fine.

188
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,120
Look.

189
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,680
Here's your ball!

190
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,040
Get your ball!
Get your ball!

191
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,440
Get..

192
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,760
Of course.

193
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,760
You don't want a tennis ball.

194
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,800
Not when you can have a meatball.

195
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,560
Come on, get the meatball.

196
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,440
God, what have I done to you?

197
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,160
I broke the dog, Pheebs!
I broke the dog!

198
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
Thanks.

199
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm going to pick up Mona.
What are you doing tonight?

200
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,160
Oh, I got big Valentine's plans.

201
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,480
I got my Chinese food on the way,
and your saltwater taffy.

202
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,760
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater..

203
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,120
We actually watched
the documentary together.

204
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,320
Oh, my Chinese food.
I'll get my cash.

205
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,880
Mona?

206
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,560
What are..?
Hi! How are you?

207
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,200
I'm supposed to pick you up.

208
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,120
I made you a Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!

209
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,680
-Oh! Hey, Mona!
-Hi, Rachel.

210
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,880
What's she doing here?

211
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
I have no idea.

212
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,440
I'll be watching TV
if anybody needs me.

213
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
What is she doing?

214
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,880
Lately she just likes
hanging out here.

215
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,280
-Why?
-I think she's lonely.

216
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,240
But it's Valentine's Day.
Can't we ask her to go?

217
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,640
Well, no, she's way too emotional.

218
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,120
And by emotional, I mean crazy!

219
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,440
That's just my Chinese food.

220
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,560
She has food delivered here?

221
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,360
Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.

222
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,200
I'm gonna get in my sweats
and eat this in bed.

223
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,760
And you thought
she was gonna be in our way!

224
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,440
Open the champagne,
and I will be right back.

225
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,840
-I've got a surprise.
-You got another ex-wife back there?

226
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,200
Please start drinking.

227
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,120
-I'm just gonna grab the phone.
-Rachel, wait.

228
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,840
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way.

229
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,280
-What are you doing?
-Do you need the phone?

230
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
No.

231
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,240
Ross is too nice to say it,
but this is his apartment.

232
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,640
We need boundaries, so why don't
you go back to your place.

233
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,720
But, Mona, I live here.

234
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,360
Happy Valentine's Day!

235
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,840
Or, something to remember me by.

236
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,960
-How long has it been this time?
-Ninety seconds.

237
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,840
Ninety seconds is a long time
not to think about it.

238
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,680
Except all I did was think about it.

239
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,480
I know. It haunts me.

240
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,240
Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was
my dad doing shots off the houseboy.

241
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,440
After this, I would gladly
make that my screen saver.

242
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,520
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.

243
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,120
I could do that.

244
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,760
Now all we gotta do
is get rid of this chair.

245
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,920
-Oh, thank God!
-I know.

246
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,000
Come in!

247
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,120
Hi. I'm sorry to barge in
on your Valentine.

248
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,920
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.

249
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,400
-Oh, my God.
-Poor Ross.

250
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,640
We watch him do yoga in his underwear,
but for this he closes the drapes.

251
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,080
You know that birthing tape
you wanted to see?

252
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
It's here.

253
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,440
We should warn you before
you watch it. Don't watch it.

254
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,080
You saw it? Is it scary?

255
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,640
It's ironic how footage
of someone being born..

256
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,760
can make you want to kill yourself.

257
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,520
Honey, she may not have to watch it
but she's going to have to do it.

258
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,520
Now I'm all freaked out.
Will you watch it with me?

259
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,160
No, but I'll leave a sweater that
smells like me right next to you.

260
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,560
Monica, come on.
You want to have kids.

261
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,520
I do.

262
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,000
But the stork
is gonna bring mine.

263
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,680
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me watch this alone.

264
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,280
She's right. Of course not.

265
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,560
Honey, get the tape.

266
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,160
This reminds me of a very specific
part of the tape.

267
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,320
Oh, sure. But if you leave a drumstick
under there and you're a bad roommate.

268
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,000
Here we go.

269
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
Okay.

270
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,440
Oh, my.

271
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,960
Come on, come on.

272
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,360
Why is that baby torturing that woman?

273
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,920
Why have I seen this thing
three times?

274
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,040
It's beautiful.

275
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,640
-It's horrible!
-I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!

276
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,240
What do I do? I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?

277
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,480
-You guys! You guys, look!
-What? Did her ass explode?

278
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,880
No, the baby's out. Look.

279
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,480
Look at those little fingers and toes.

280
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Look how happy the mom is now.

281
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,120
-Oh, Rach.
-Screw you! You don't have to do it!

282
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,760
-Hey.
-Hey!

283
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,440
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.

284
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,320
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?

285
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,800
Lately, I haven't exactly been
the perfect boyfriend.

286
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,520
I didn't tell her
I got Rachel pregnant.

287
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,640
I gave her a key to my apartment
and then had the locks changed.

288
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,280
Then I lied to her about Rachel
moving in with me.

289
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,240
In a way, I judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner.

290
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,080
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.

291
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,800
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?

292
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,800
Joey without a date
on Valentine's Day?

293
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,200
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?

294
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
-Sort of.
-Really?

295
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,800
You don't have to seem
so happy about it.

296
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,480
Maybe I can help.

297
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,440
Whatever it is,
I am sure it has happened to me.

298
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,360
You know, actually,
once I got dumped during sex.

299
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,040
-So anyway, what is it?
-Forget about it. It's no big deal.

300
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,680
-Come on, what is it?
-It's nothing.

301
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,560
Hey, it's me.
Why can't you tell me?

302
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,400
Okay. Sit down.

303
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,760
There's this woman that I like a lot.

304
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,000
But it can't happen.

305
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,680
She's not a Tribbiani?

306
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,360
No!

307
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,600
So is she someone from work?

308
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,080
Yes.

309
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,520
Well, does she like you?

310
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,680
Sometimes I think she could.

311
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,400
But I can't do anything about it.

312
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,680
Why not?

313
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,600
It's complicated.

314
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
She was with this other guy
for a long time.

315
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,840
Someone from work too.

316
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,680
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

317
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Wait, I thought you
hated everyone at work.

318
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,480
No, no. I only say that..

319
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,360
so Chandler won't feel threatened
because I'm his only friend.

320
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,520
Excuse me?

321
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,040
Sorry, sorry.
And I'm your only friend too.

322
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,840
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he still in love with her?

323
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,800
-No, I don't think so.
-Okay.

324
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,720
Is he a good guy?

325
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,160
Yeah, he's the best.

326
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,960
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.

327
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,240
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.

328
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,000
I do, so much.

329
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,920
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..

330
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,480
You know what?
You have to go for it.

331
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,640
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

332
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,200
Here's your warm milk.

333
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,480
I'm gonna put the bourbon
in it at home.

334
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,160
Anyway, seriously,
just talk to the guy, okay?

335
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,720
Let me know how it goes.

336
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,920
It's Rachel.

337
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,360
You're having a baby
and you need to prepare.

338
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,280
You're gonna make yourself watch
the whole thing. Just do it!

339
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,760
I came to the big city
to become a star.

340
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,400
-I'll do anything to make that happen.
-Anything?

341
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,920
Maybe it starts with
how she gets pregnant.

342
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,000
I wonder which one of these guys
becomes the father.

343
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,160
No, no.
Can't get pregnant that way.
