1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,640
All right!

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,400
Yes! From home to the hospital
in under seven minutes! We did it.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,760
Yes, the hard part is truly over.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,080
No, but come on, we're off
to a great start, aren't we?

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,800
I knew I'd get here fast, but this
has gotta be some kind of a record!

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,040
-Oh, you made it!
-Hi.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,000
-How the hell did you beat us here?
-We took a cab. Did you guys walk?

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,760
No, we took a cab too.
But I did test runs..

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,480
Hey, you made it!

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,360
Okay, is there some kind of magic
tunnel to this hospital?

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,520
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,520
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.
I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,640
Right. We have a semi-private
labor room waiting for you, so..

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,040
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,320
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately,
we can't guarantee a private room.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,880
-And, currently, they're all unavailable.
-Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,560
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms
are all we have.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,280
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,680
Yeah?

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,960
-Give her some money.
-I really think they're out of rooms.

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,000
They're not, Ross. They're just
saving them for important people!

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,760
Okay? What if I was the president?

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,720
Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,760
Okay.

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,840
Say, would you mind checking again?

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,200
See if any private rooms
may have opened up?

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,120
This is a hospital.

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,040
Okay, I see.
Could we please talk to the manager?

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,960
There is no manager.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,560
Just nurses, doctors
and semi-private rooms.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,040
Okay, you know what? I have to say,
I don't really care for your tone.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,880
And this is not the only hospital in this
city, and we have no problem.. Oh, gosh!

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,760
-What? What?
-Contraction!

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,560
-Would you like to see a semi-private room?
-Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,040
Well, you're only two centimeters
dilated, and we need to get to 10.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
-It'll be a while.
-Oh, okay.

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
-I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
-Thank you.

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,200
Oh, wait, Dr. Long.
Can I ask you something?

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
Is labor really as painful
as everybody says it is?

40
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,120
Oh, look at that.
My beeper's going crazy.

41
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,240
Hey, don't.. You know what?
You're gonna be fine.

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,960
-I guess we have some time to kill.
-Yeah, guess so.

43
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,880
Oh, check these out.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,880
Never done this before.

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,320
Doesn't feel good.

46
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,240
Yeah, well, it looks great.

47
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,400
Thank you very much.
I think we're ready to..

48
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,360
Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin
this magical day for you.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,760
Oh, no, not at all. It's okay.
Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,960
-Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
-Oh, hi, Rachel.

51
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,240
-Is this your first?
-Yeah, it is.

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,040
Well, little Jamie here is our third.

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,520
So if you have any questions, or
you need anything at all, just holler.

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,560
-That's so sweet.
-Yeah.

55
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,280
-Let me give you guys some privacy.
-Nonsense. We're all in this together.

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,720
We are gonna share every
moment of this with you.

57
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,560
-I think we're gonna have some fun.
-Yeah.

58
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,800
-Oh, okay, I guess.
-Hey, smile!

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,920
-I don't know if..
-I really don't want any..

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,200
Oh, thank you.

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,520
Oh, Ross!
Here comes another contraction.

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,760
Okay, just breathe.

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,360
-Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
-Oh, my God!

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,040
Hey, look at this.

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,200
-Here you go!
-Oh, no!

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.

67
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,960
The miracle of birth
sure is a snooze-fest.

68
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,560
-Hey, you wanna see something?
-Sure. What?

69
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,800
This is gonna be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.

70
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,000
-Honey?
-Yeah?

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Listen, I've been doing
some thinking..

72
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,240
and I don't know whether
it's because we're here..

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,040
or Rachel's giving birth..

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,000
but I think we should
try to have a baby.

75
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Okay.

76
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,800
What's that now?

77
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,040
Okay. I've been thinking about it too,
and I think we're ready.

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,800
Are you kidding? You think
we're ready to have a baby now?

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,360
This is fun.

80
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,120
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!

81
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,880
You said you were ready too.

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,120
Yeah, but I was just screwing with you to
try to get your voice all high and weird..

83
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,600
Like mine is now!

84
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,680
Yes, but haven't you
wanted a kid, like, forever?

85
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,120
Yeah, but no one ever wanted
to have one with me. I mean..

86
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,200
Now I'm just gonna have a baby if I
want to. Oh, what are you doing to me?

87
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,560
I'm sorry I brought it up.

88
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,200
Okay, then, back off, mister!

89
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,360
Because I am ready to have a baby.

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,960
I just want Joey to be the father.

91
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,280
-What? Are you crazy?
-That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!

92
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,480
I am sorry. The doctor insisted
on closing the curtain for the exam.

93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,800
Oh, that's very..
Really, very, very okay.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,440
Julie's cervix is dilated seven
centimeters. That's about four fingers!

95
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
-Doctor let me feel it myself.
-Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,680
-No, I don't.. We're not gonna do that.
-We won't be doing that.

97
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,120
Well, if you like, you could feel
Rachel's, then feel mine to compare.

98
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,880
-Am I interrupting?
-Yes! Thank you! Later.

99
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,600
-No, you can't leave me alone with them.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,560
No, Ross? Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!

101
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,120
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna
be a while. I wish you'd called first.

102
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,800
That's all right.
I'm coming back later with your father.

103
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,960
-I needed to talk to you before the birth.
-Okay. What's up?

104
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Ross, I want to talk
to you as your mother..

105
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,840
even though I know that you and I
are also very close friends.

106
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,320
I really don't know what
you're talking about, but okay.

107
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,960
I brought something
that I want to give you.

108
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,640
Assuming, of course, that you want it.

109
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,320
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?

110
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,600
This is your grandmother's engagement
ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.

111
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,120
-Mom, no. Come on. Thank you.
-Just hear me out..

112
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,880
No! Okay? We've been through this.

113
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,920
We're not gonna get married
just because she's pregnant. Okay?

114
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Honestly, Ross, this isn't just some girl
you picked up in a bar and humped.

115
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,880
You think young people use
that word more than we actually do.

116
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,080
Ross, a child should have a family.

117
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,880
You know what? I can't deal
with this right now. I'm sorry.

118
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,440
Go.. Hey, go talk to Monica.

119
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,120
She got a new haircut.
You'll hate it.

120
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,040
Just think about it. If you don't,
I'll talk more about humping.

121
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
Give me.

122
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,840
-Hi, dear.
-Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

123
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,800
Ross, get in here!

124
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,360
You wanna see something funny?

125
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,400
Monica.

126
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,960
Okay. All right, stop it.
You're freaking me out.

127
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,800
Do it again. Do it again.

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,800
Hey, Rachel had the baby.

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,400
-What?
-Really?

130
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,520
No.

131
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,600
I don't know why
I thought that'd be funny.

132
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,120
You said hi to Mom
before she left, right?

133
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
I thought that was her.

134
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,520
Yeah, I called her name,
and she ducked into a stairwell.

135
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,760
Well, you know what?
Consider yourself lucky.

136
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,360
She pulled me out of the labor room
to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.

137
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
-Oh, my God.
-How annoying.

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,520
Yeah.

139
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,800
-Why aren't you with Rachel?
-You're kidding, right?

140
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,760
Look, we're not gonna be together
just because we're having this baby.

141
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,120
And I know she's not
just some girl I humped..

142
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,640
Oh, humped?

143
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,760
Come on, Ross.

144
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,840
But it just seems that
you two belong together.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,840
Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this
right now. I have to go have a baby.

146
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,520
Right. And with who again?

147
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,880
He's crazy. Why doesn't
he wanna be with Rachel?

148
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
I know.

149
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,480
Seriously, she's like the perfect woman.
I mean, I know she turned me down..

150
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,960
but if she hadn't
and she wanted to be with me..

151
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,760
I would take her in my arms and..

152
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,680
I haven't bummed you guys out
like this in a while, have I?

153
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,640
-Hey.
-Hey.

154
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,320
-Who's that?
-New people.

155
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,760
What happened to the Disgustingtons?

156
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,080
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!

157
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,800
Right after you left,
they wheeled her off into delivery.

158
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,880
Oh, but not before she gave me a nice,
juicy shot of little Jamie crowning away.

159
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,600
Wow. Sorry.

160
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,320
So how are the new people?

161
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,080
Well, they have some unusual
pet names for each other.

162
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,320
Including "Evil Bitch"
and "Sick Bastard."

163
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,160
-Oh, gosh, a contraction.
-Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.

164
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,280
-Are you looking at her?
-No!

165
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,480
-Don't you look at her, you sick bastard!
-Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!

166
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,720
She's in labor. You like that,
you sick son of a bitch?

167
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,560
I'm just gonna..

168
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,400
See? It's because you were looking,
you fat pervert.

169
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,920
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.

170
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,600
You miss your girlfriend?

171
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,000
Just ignore them.

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,560
-You okay?
-Yeah.

173
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,240
-Ross.
-What?

174
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,920
-He's looking at me.
-Hey!

175
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,920
You wanna live to see your baby?

176
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,240
Don't you talk to my husband like that,
you stupid bastard!

177
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,520
Oh, good God! If you want
a baby so bad, just go steal it!

178
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,880
Oh, don't worry.
These babies are far too ugly for us.

179
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,640
What is going on with you.
Since when are you so crazy about babies?

180
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,960
I'm not crazy about babies.
I'm crazy about us.

181
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,600
What?

182
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,440
We've always talked about having
babies someday, not now..

183
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,640
but I'm starting to think that we
can handle it. We're good.

184
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,400
We're really good.

185
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,760
We are pretty good.

186
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,960
But nothing has to happen
until you're ready.

187
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,560
Well, maybe I'm ready now.

188
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,560
I mean, it's a little scary,
but maybe it's right.

189
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,680
What? It's not right!
We're not ready to have a kid now!

190
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,920
-What?
-I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.

191
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,320
So we're gonna try?
I mean, we're trying?

192
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,120
We're trying to get pregnant.

193
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,600
I'm not comfortable doing
this in front of the babies.

194
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,960
-So when do you want to start trying?
-All right, hold on a sec.

195
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,880
-Period math?
-Yeah.

196
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,560
Well, we could start trying now.

197
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,240
-Right here?
-No, not here.

198
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,680
Maybe here.

199
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,880
It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill,
and we're in a building that's full of beds!

200
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,200
And it's so clean!

201
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,400
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!

202
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,280
-It ate your money?
-No.

203
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,080
-I'll see you downstairs then.
-All right.

204
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,400
Hey, I got one! I got one!

205
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
-Hi.
-Hi.

206
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,760
-Oh, up or down?
-Oh. Down, please.

207
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,000
I hate to be a ball-buster,
but can I just do it?

208
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,040
-Could you press up too?
-Sure.

209
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,640
-I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.
-Yeah? How'd yours happen?

210
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,160
Well, it's a long story,
it's kind of embarrassing.

211
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Let's just say there was a
typographical error with a sex manual.

212
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,880
-How about you?
-Car accident.

213
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,800
Some idiot on a cell phone
wasn't paying attention?

214
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,720
Yeah. Me.

215
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,640
-Sorry.
-Oh, no. No, don't be.

216
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,760
Nobody else got hurt.
And I was pretty lucky.

217
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, I, for one, am glad you made it.

218
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,720
Are you sure?
I mean, you don't know me.

219
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,800
I could have been sent
from another planet to destroy Earth.

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,520
Couldn't press the "down" button.
I think Earth's okay.

221
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,360
Oh, hey, that's me.

222
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,080
Hey, I take it you're
just visiting someone.

223
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
Well, if you have some time
and you wanna visit someone else..

224
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,240
Yeah, I would like that.

225
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,000
-Great. I'm in room..
-Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!

226
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,680
You gotta press the button.

227
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,240
The nurse said
they're bringing in another woman.

228
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,520
Oh. Is she pregnant yet?

229
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,120
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before I do.

230
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,680
-Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
-Oh, okay. Here, here.

231
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,520
That's it.

232
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,000
-Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
-Yeah, it was.

233
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,760
Mine haven't been so bad.
Oh, here comes one now.

234
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,720
Oh, that was a big one.

235
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
That was, like, the biggest one yet.
Are you okay, honey?

236
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,520
I'm okay, honey.

237
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,720
Well, I got some bad news.
It gets worse.

238
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,760
And when you get to the end,
they get really big..

239
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,360
and they come, like, every minute.

240
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, mine are pretty close together.
I think..

241
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,560
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, that's quite all right.

242
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,880
Oh, by the way, my name's Johanna.
What's yours?

243
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,600
Excuse me, could you help me
with something?

244
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm looking for a man.

245
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,520
Well, who isn't?

246
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,520
You. You aren't.

247
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,320
Good for you.

248
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,200
Anyway, the patient
I'm looking for has a broken leg.

249
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,560
He's in a wheelchair. He's early
to mid-30s, very attractive.

250
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,880
Even you would think so.

251
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,960
-I know who you're talking about.
-Great! What room number is he in?

252
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,640
I'm sorry.
Patient information is confidential.

253
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,480
No, I'm not gonna bother him.
We were talking earlier..

254
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,240
Ma'am, I'm sorry. That information
is restricted to hospital staff.

255
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,840
-She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
-Dr. Drake who?

256
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,440
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.

257
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,560
-A doctor at this hospital?
-Damn it, we're losing precious time.

258
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,640
You want this man's blood
on your head..?

259
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,760
-Hands.
-Hands!

260
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,560
It is absolutely essential that you tell me
what room he is staying in.

261
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,960
He's a patient of mine.
I've treated him for years.

262
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,560
-He's in room 816.
-816. Thank you.

263
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,400
-And what is his name?
-No.

264
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,080
-I think we found a place.
-Okay.

265
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,880
Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?

266
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,360
Hello, Monica.

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,320
-Not like that.
-Oh, okay.

268
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,880
-We'll dim the lights.
-Okay.

269
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,960
Or turn them out altogether.

270
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,920
No scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.

271
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,720
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.

272
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,360
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.
Do we have a condom?

273
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,680
Oh, right!

274
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,080
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.

275
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,800
This is it!

276
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,400
-That's him!
-Great. Go get him!

277
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,880
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.

278
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,480
He's not really my type.

279
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,720
Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him
questions and see what he's like.

280
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,400
-People tell doctors everything.
-You said he was this great guy.

281
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,840
All the guys I meet seem nice at first,
then turn out to be big jerks.

282
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,160
-You do attract some stinkers.
-Yeah, I know.

283
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,480
Dr. Long, I've been at this
for 17 hours.

284
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,120
Three women have come
and gone with their babies.

285
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,840
You gotta give me good news. How many
centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?

286
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,080
-Three.
-Just three?

287
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,560
I'm dilated three!

288
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,760
We are moving along just slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.

289
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,160
-I'll be back soon.
-Thank you.

290
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,960
You know what? I'm not waiting.
I'm gonna push this baby out.

291
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,840
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?

292
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,840
-Actually, it's more like this.
-Oh, stupid metric system.

293
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,080
We're gonna need to take you straight
to the delivery room.

294
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,080
Oh, for the love of God!

295
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,920
It's coming! It's coming!

296
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,200
And here it is!

297
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,560
Oh, come on!

298
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,600
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few
routine questions I need to ask you.

299
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,960
Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.

300
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,120
I know. I'm a neurologist.
Just to be on the safe side..

301
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,160
Dr. Wells wanted a more
comprehensive overview. So he sent me.

302
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,880
Dr. Wells is a woman!

303
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,920
That was a test. Good response.

304
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,560
-All right. Full name?
-Clifford Burnett.

305
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,920
-Date of birth?
-November 16, 1968.

306
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,520
Age?

307
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,240
-Can't you figure that out?
-I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.

308
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,960
-I'm 33.
-Okay.

309
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,120
-And are you married?
-No.

310
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,520
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would
you say you have commitment issues?

311
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,920
Are all the questions this personal?

312
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,560
Yes.

313
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,800
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.

314
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,280
-Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
-Yeah.

315
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,120
I lost my wife five years ago
to a mild cardial infarction.

316
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,720
-A heart attack, doctor.
-Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, mild car..

317
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,960
Are you experiencing any dizziness?

318
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,160
No.

319
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,560
-Has the pain been getting worse?
-No.

320
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,760
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

321
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,880
-No.
-Excellent. Excellent.

322
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,480
And finally, are you into any weird
stuff, you know, sexually?

323
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,560
-No!
-Wrong answer.

324
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,120
-This room's available.
-Okay! Wait, you listen to me!

325
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,600
Since I have been waiting,
four women..

326
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,320
that's four, one higher than
the number of centimeters I'm dilated..

327
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,600
have come and gone with their babies.
I'm next. It's my turn. It's only fair.

328
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,840
If you bring in one more woman who has
her baby before me, I will sue you.

329
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,160
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.

330
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,000
-Rach?
-You get back on that case, honey!

331
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,120
I don't think the next
patient is very far along.

332
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,760
Okay. Well, then bring her in.

333
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,800
Oh, my God!

334
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,640
I can't believe this!

335
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,480
And yet, somehow, it's true.

336
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,320
I mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!

337
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,800
Squeeze your legs together
and cover the baby's ears.

338
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,280
-Hi, sweetie!
-Hi, sweetheart.

339
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,120
This is my husband, Sid. I don't think
you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.

340
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,840
I nabbed him a year ago
at the dermatologist's office.

341
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,760
Thank God for adult acne!

342
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,720
I still can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

343
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,640
Really?

344
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,640
What'd he say?

345
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,520
You have to speak very loudly,
he's almost completely deaf.

346
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,000
-Oh, there you go.
-Of course he is.

347
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,000
Congratulations, you two.
I didn't even know you got married.

348
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,280
-Oh, we didn't.
-What?

349
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,720
We're just having this baby together,
but that's all, you know.

350
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,600
Why?

351
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,760
We're just not in that place, you know?
But we're very excited about this.

352
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,680
Oh. Well, then shut me up.

353
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,920
Just tell me how.

354
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,520
Oh, I feel another one coming.

355
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,000
Sid, you lucky, deaf bastard.

356
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,840
-What else? What else?
-He's 33.

357
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,600
A widower.

358
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,040
He seemed like a standup guy.
And he's not into anything weird sexually.

359
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,720
Enter Phoebe!

360
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,680
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty
private room right next door to hers?

361
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,840
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

362
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,840
Well, let me think about that
while I remove my pants!

363
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,040
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!

364
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,480
Does that sound like Janice?

365
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,480
If it's not, then there's two of them.

366
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,240
And that would mean
it's the end of the world!

367
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,840
Hey.

368
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
-Hey.
-Hi.

369
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,200
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How you doing?

370
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,240
Not bad. You know that feeling, trying
to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?

371
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,320
And soon someone will call her "Mom."

372
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,840
Weirdest thing. Did I hear..?

373
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,400
Mother of God, it's true!

374
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,120
Chandler Bing!

375
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,240
Janice.

376
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,920
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.

377
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,520
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.

378
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,080
You remember, Chandler.

379
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,360
I feel so bad for you.

380
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,840
She's your ex. And I have Richard.

381
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,040
Janice, I didn't even know
you were pregnant.

382
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,840
Who's the unwitting human
whose essence you've stolen?

383
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,760
It's you.

384
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,160
This is yours.

385
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,920
What?

386
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,000
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!

387
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,800
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?

388
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,120
Okay, I've got one for you.
If you had to, which would you eat?

389
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,560
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

390
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,000
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

391
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,760
Because at least I could explain to him
that you're making me eat him.

392
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,760
-Oh. Somebody went to college.
-Yeah.

393
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,800
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

394
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.

395
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,720
Oh. I'll get it.

396
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,680
I usually get to know a girl better
before I let her spoon me.

397
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,040
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

398
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,880
When. When.

399
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,160
Thank you. Listen.

400
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,840
You seem to really know
what to do with a utensil.

401
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?

402
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,440
-Yeah, I'd really like that.
-Yeah?

403
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,440
Yeah. And I promise I won't make
you eat any remarkable animals.

404
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,480
I was thinking..

405
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,560
I'd kind of like to make a move.

406
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,280
But, you know, with the leg.

407
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,280
Oh, yeah.

408
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,480
Maybe a little help.

409
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,760
Okay.

410
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,800
Let me fix your pillow.

411
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Cliff, you're so forward.

412
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,160
Oh, it was really nice meeting you.

413
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,520
Sid!

414
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,080
That's the first time I heard her voice.

415
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,000
I didn't care for it.

416
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,680
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies..

417
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,200
and I have had no babies.

418
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,080
Why doesn't she want to come out?

419
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,480
You know what I think it is?
I think you made such a nice home for her..

420
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,520
over the last nine months
that she just doesn't want to leave.

421
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,440
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.

422
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,520
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Okay.

423
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,200
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

424
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,600
Doctor, you gotta do something!
Get me drugs..

425
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,640
or light a fire up in there
and just smoke it out!

426
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,560
Actually, I think you're ready to go
to the delivery room.

427
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,720
What?

428
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,120
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.

429
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,680
Oh, my God. Okay.

430
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,040
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.

431
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,720
Is this the same spoon
that was in my cast?

432
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,480
You know what?

433
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,920
This one is.

434
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,320
Oh, my God! That's the doctor
who was in my room before.

435
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,880
Well, it must be one of those
closed-circuit hospital channels.

436
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,480
No, no. That's a soap opera.

437
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,240
This is a very dramatic hospital.

438
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,800
I'm telling you,
the guy from that show was here..

439
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,520
asking me all these weird questions.

440
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,760
Okay, Mr. Percocet.

441
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,920
I swear to you, that's the guy.

442
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,360
Okay, Cliff.

443
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here in your room?

444
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,320
What probably happened was you were
watching this, you drifted off to sleep..

445
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,840
and you dreamt he was here.

446
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Rachel's having her baby!

447
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,560
Which is of no interest
to me as a neurologist. I..

448
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,640
That's him! You know him?

449
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,280
Wake up, Cliff!

450
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,320
What is going on?

451
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,680
Okay. Okay. I.. Okay.

452
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,720
I sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.

453
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,680
If it.. You know, if it helps,
you came off great.

454
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,400
A lot better than I'm coming off
right now.

455
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,520
I don't believe this. You got him
to pretend he was a fake doctor?

456
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,160
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

457
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:26,400
-You tried making me think I was crazy?
-That was wrong. I'm so sorry.

458
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,720
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?

459
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,000
I don't think so.

460
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,960
If I may? You told me a lot
of personal stuff about you, right?

461
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,960
Now, maybe it would help if you knew
some personal stuff about her.

462
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,440
She was married to a gay ice dancer.

463
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,840
She gave birth to her
brother's triplets.

464
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,720
Her twin sister used to do porn.

465
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,840
-We're trying to dial down the crazy.
-Right.

466
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,280
We don't really know each other,
so it'd be easy to forget about this..

467
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,440
but there's something between us.
I don't know about you..

468
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,200
but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

469
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,520
-It doesn't happen to me either.
-Me neither!

470
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,160
-The baby! Rachel!
-Right, right!

471
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,200
Oh, I love this scene.

472
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,760
Okay, look. I gotta go too.

473
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,600
But.. What do you say?
Can we just have that dinner?

474
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,560
The triplets.

475
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,120
You and your brother didn't..?

476
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
No! No, they implanted embryos.

477
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,800
-Then dinner sounds great.
-Great! Okay.

478
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,480
All right, then I'll see you later.

479
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,120
Our friend's having a baby.

480
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,960
-Her own?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

481
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,000
No, she's really old-fashioned.

482
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,560
Push. Push. We're gonna push
for five more seconds.

483
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,400
Five, four..

484
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,800
Three, two, one! Oh!

485
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,680
The next contraction should be
in about 20 seconds.

486
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,640
-I can't push anymore!
-You're doing great.

487
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,880
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

488
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,320
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

489
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,280
-Come on.
-Push. Wait.

490
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,960
-I see something.
-What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!

491
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,160
-Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!
-What is that?

492
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,720
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.

493
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,920
-I thought she had two heads.
-Oh, God!

494
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,320
Is she gonna be okay?

495
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,880
-She's gonna be fine.
-Okay.

496
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,120
She's in a more difficult position,
so you have to push harder now.

497
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,560
-Okay.
-That's it. Push. Push.

498
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,560
You're gonna have to push even harder.

499
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,120
-I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!
-Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

500
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,440
I had no idea.
Please, you do it for me!

501
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,800
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

502
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,240
Good.

503
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,960
Keep pushing!

504
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,560
Are you okay?

505
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,120
You have no idea how much this hurts.

506
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,240
Keep going! Keep going!

507
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
Here we go!

508
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,800
She's upside down, but she's coming!

509
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,520
-Oh, God!
-Oh! Oh, my God!

510
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,520
Oh, my God, she's here.

511
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,400
Oh, she's perfect.

512
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,360
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.

513
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,360
-Where'd she go?
-They're just wrapping her up.

514
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.

515
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,280
Here she is.

516
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,160
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

517
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,000
I know. Oh.

518
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,400
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

519
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,000
-Do we have a name yet?
-No, not yet.

520
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,600
That's fine. For now we'll just
call her Baby Girl Greene.

521
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,280
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.

522
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,400
Hello, Baby Girl.

523
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,560
-Can we come in?
-Oh, come on in.

524
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,480
-Oh, there she is.
-Oh, she's so beautiful.

525
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,080
Here.

526
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,200
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

527
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,160
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.

528
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,680
It's incredible. I mean,
one minute she's inside you..

529
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,960
and then 47 hours later,
here she is.

530
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,960
She looks so real.

531
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,240
You know what I mean.

532
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,800
She's this whole tiny little person.

533
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,600
And she already has eyelashes
and knees and..

534
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,000
-What?
-Oh, no, no. It's okay.

535
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,880
For a second, I counted six fingers, but one
was from the other hand. So we're good.

536
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,640
-Okay, my turn. My turn.
-Aunt Phoebe.

537
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,960
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!

538
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,040
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

539
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,680
I won't.

540
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,200
-Honey, what's the matter?
-Nothing. I just can't stop crying.

541
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,080
The doctor said it's normal, with all
the hormones, plus you're sleep-deprived.

542
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,320
So. You guys are all sleep-deprived.

543
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,360
I don't see you weeping because you
put your slippers on the wrong feet.

544
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,400
Oh, God.

545
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,960
-What's the matter now?
-I was reliving it.

546
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,800
Do you know what you're gonna
call her yet?

547
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,040
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
I thought that was so original.

548
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,560
Actually, we've narrowed it
down to two names.

549
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,480
And you know what? I love them both.
So just pick one, and that'll be it.

550
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,120
Wow, okay. Everyone..

551
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,200
this is Isabella.

552
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,120
-Hi, Isabella!
-Hi.

553
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,840
What?

554
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,640
That's not her name.

555
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,160
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an Isabella.

556
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,000
So then I guess Ferdinand is out.

557
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,680
-What was the other one?
-Delilah.

558
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,480
Oh, great! Suddenly she
sounds like a biblical whore.

559
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,840
So I guess we're back to Baby Girl.

560
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,600
What are we gonna do?

561
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,400
-It's okay. You'll find a name.
-Easy for you to say.

562
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,280
You already know what your
kids' names will be.

563
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,680
-You do?
-I had them picked out since I was 14.

564
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,640
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after
some snack or baked good, isn't it?

565
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,640
-Well, tell us, what are they?
-Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

566
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,080
-And if it's a girl?
-I don't wanna say.

567
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,160
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.

568
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,720
Okay. It's Emma.

569
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,840
Emma.

570
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,360
See, I don't want it.

571
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,560
Do you have any other totally perfect
names that you're not gonna use?

572
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,640
-Take it.
-What?

573
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,840
She's clearly an Emma.

574
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,200
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

575
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,760
Yeah, but I love you more.

576
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,920
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.

577
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,280
Hi, Emma.

578
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,680
Yep, that's you.

579
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,880
You're our little Em.

580
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,320
What's that, honey?

581
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,800
What?

582
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,480
Oh, you want a little cousin?

583
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,720
You want a cousin right now?

584
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,280
Do I look like a giant
sperm to all of you, or..?

585
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,360
-That was amazing.
-I know.

586
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,920
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?

587
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,240
We may have started our family.
In nine months we could be here..

588
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,560
having our own baby.

589
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,920
And if not, we got to do it
on a bucket.

590
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,320
I love you so much.

591
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,680
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

592
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,240
You wanna do it again?

593
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,600
This time just for us?

594
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,600
Probably.

595
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,280
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.

596
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,760
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?

597
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,560
He's a keeper.

598
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,400
Look at the little munchkin.

599
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,320
Don't you worry. By the time
you're old enough to date him..

600
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,520
he's gonna have a different nose.

601
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,000
-How you feeling?
-Oh, I'm fine.

602
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,520
I really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.

603
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,240
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

604
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,640
Sure. Now. But what happens when he
meets somebody else and gets married?

605
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,960
Well, then he gets a divorce.
It's Ross.

606
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,840
I'm telling you, Rachel, listen to Janice.

607
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,920
They all say they're gonna be there,
until they start their real family.

608
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,320
-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
-That's what I thought.

609
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,600
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
a weekend with her father..

610
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,080
and little Miss New Boobs.

611
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,920
Really?

612
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,560
I hate to be the one to say it..

613
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,600
but, honey, you two are on your own.

614
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,480
Well, that's.. You know, that's..

615
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,760
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.

616
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,520
Maybe we won't be alone.

617
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,440
Because lately things have been
happening between me and Ross.

618
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,160
And right before I went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?

619
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:59,040
So it might be the beginning
of something.

620
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,240
-Hey, Janice.
-Oh, hi.

621
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,680
Who's this little guy?

622
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,040
-Aaron, your future son-in-law.
-Oh, no, no.

623
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,240
No.

624
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,560
-I'm gonna leave you three alone.
-Okay.

625
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,160
Man, you see the kid on that nose?

626
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,080
You know what I was thinking about?

627
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,000
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?

628
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,960
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

629
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,760
But we.. We gotta be careful.

630
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,160
We.. You know, we can't let
that happen again, you know?

631
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,560
Right.

632
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:56,880
-We don't want to go down that road.
-No. That's why I brought it up.

633
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,080
-They didn't have any sodas?
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

634
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,160
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.

635
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,600
And so it begins.

636
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,000
She in there?

637
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,520
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.

638
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,120
Isn't it amazing how
every baby is beautiful?

639
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,240
Except that one.

640
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,960
What is this? A petting zoo?

641
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,480
Look. Look at Emma.

642
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,400
I can't decide who she looks like,
you or Rachel.

643
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,800
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.

644
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,640
I'm sorry. For the last time,
why aren't you two together again?

645
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,600
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.

646
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,840
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.

647
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,560
It's complicated, okay?

648
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,320
Yeah, that's true.

649
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,640
You love her, you always have,
you have a child together.

650
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,000
There's no right answer.

651
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:22,240
Look, we've been together.
Then apart. Then together, then apart.

652
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,240
And now we have a baby.

653
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,080
It's just, if we got together again
and it didn't work out..

654
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,680
I could never do that to Emma.

655
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,880
I mean, she came into this world
thinking everything.. Now me.

656
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,640
What, do they put something
in the water here?

657
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,600
It's just, Rachel and I,
we're doing really well now.

658
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,440
I know. If you try to make it more,
you might wreck it.

659
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,440
-Yeah, exactly.
-Right.

660
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,040
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were 15.

661
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,280
Hey.

662
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,840
I saw a woman breast-feeding
twins at the same time.

663
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,680
It is like a freak show up here.

664
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,120
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

665
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,880
What is it? Hey.

666
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,200
-Really, it's nothing. I'm..
-Rach, come on. What?

667
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,800
I've just been thinking about how
my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

668
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,960
What are you talking about?
What about Ross?

669
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,080
Please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.

670
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,280
Okay, how long
was I watching that woman?

671
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,440
I'm just saying that, you know..

672
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,640
someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody..

673
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,520
and he's gonna have his own life.

674
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,960
Right?

675
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,840
Yeah, I guess so.

676
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,920
I just never thought I'd be raising
this baby all by myself.

677
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,800
That's pretty dumb, huh?

678
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

679
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,160
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

680
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,840
Okay? I promise
I won't let that happen.

681
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,440
Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would I do without you?

682
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,040
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?

683
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,480
Could you grab me my other box
of tissues?

684
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,120
-They're under Ross' coat.
-Sure.

685
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,160
Oh, my God!

686
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,520
Joey?

687
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,960
Oh, my God.

688
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,080
Okay.
