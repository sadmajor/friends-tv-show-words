1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,120
-What's up?
-I left my guitar here.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,680
Okay. No problem.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,760
Okay. Here you go.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,280
-What?
-You want to hang out or something?

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,120
You caught me at a bad time.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,880
-Are you and Chandler..?
-Exactly.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,920
-Can I play for you?
-No.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,400
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,880
You ask an intriguing question,
Chandler Bing.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,600
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
You never let me massage you.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,440
Phoebe, I can explain.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,200
You see..

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,800
God, I gotta get better at lying.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,720
You said you hate massages.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,960
Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
Don't let Phoebe in.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,960
How long has this been going on?

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,760
-Well, Alexandra has..
-It has a name?

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,960
Phoebe, don't get upset.

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,240
Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
Come on, Chandler, let's go.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Well, I thought I'd..

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,160
Yeah, what the hell.

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,800
One more push.
Come on, we're almost there.

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,520
I'm happy things worked out for us
and we're having this baby. I love you.

24
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
I love you too.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,960
I hope it's not
an inappropriate time to say..

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,720
you're the best sex I've ever had.

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,720
That's always appropriate.

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,440
Okay, come on, one more push.
One more push.

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,880
There we go.

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,120
Here is your beautiful baby.
Congratulations.

31
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,680
I hope you're a better father
than you are a friend!

32
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,360
Joey!

33
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,520
-What's going on?
-Come feel my belly.

34
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,560
-The baby's kicking for the first time.
-Really?

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,240
Yes.

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,920
You know what? Maybe you..

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,080
Maybe you should come to me.
I'm not wearing any bottoms.

38
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,320
It's unbelievable!

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,960
Wow, she is kicking so much.
She's like..

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,040
Who's that annoying
girl soccer player?

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,120
-Mia Hamm?
-Mia Hamm!

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,520
-It's amazing.
-One hand on the sheet, Joe.

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,720
Sorry.

45
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
Hey, babe.

46
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,840
We got a wedding gift from Bob and
Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?

47
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,360
Who says you can't get
a nice punch bowl for under $6?

48
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,120
-Maybe we can take it back.
-Where would we return it?

49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,320
How about to the street,
from the balcony?

50
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
We can't do that.
What if they come by for a visit?

51
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,240
Let's cross that bridge when my aunt
and uncle who I haven't seen in 15 years..

52
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,120
drop by unexpectedly and
demand a giant bowl of punch.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,760
Why don't we just find a place for it?

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,960
In that cabinet?

55
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,480
That's for canned goods. Have you
forgotten everything from orientation?

56
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,160
How about the closet by the bathroom?

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,520
-Okay. Let me do it.
-No, I'll do it.

58
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,600
You have to relax and let me
take care of things once in a while.

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,920
It's locked. You have to help me.
Why is it locked?

60
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,320
No reason.
I keep private things in there.

61
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,600
I've been here a while,
and I've never seen what's in there.

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,720
What is in there?

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,640
Feminine stuff.

64
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,160
Don't try to make me uncomfortable
with feminine stuff!

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,720
Nothing in there concerns you.
If you love me, you'll just let it go.

66
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,560
-Fine.
-Thank you.

67
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Love you.

68
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,880
Hello, Chandler.
Lovely day, huh? You.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,920
If it helps, Alexandra's only
been massaging her for three years.

70
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,760
If! I said, if it helps.

71
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
Why won't you let me massage you?

72
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,360
I'd be self-conscious.
You're my friend. I'd be naked.

73
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,320
We lived together for years.
I've seen you naked.

74
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,840
That's different. We were roommates.
And when?

75
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm curious about the human body.

76
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,480
You can understand
why this would be weird.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm a professional
and I'm really good.

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,000
If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
Give me a chance. Please?

79
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,720
If it means that much to you.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,800
It does. How would you feel
if you couldn't share your cooking?

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,160
Or how Ross would feel
if he couldn't teach us about dragons.

82
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,200
-Dinosaurs.
-Potato, potahto.

83
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,160
Ross, the baby's kicking.

84
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,360
What? It is?

85
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,400
It's not kicking now.

86
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,800
Although we would love
to see you do that again.

87
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
When? What happened?

88
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,640
Last night. I went into Joey's room,
and he was sleeping.

89
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,360
A dreamless sleep.

90
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,640
My God, the baby's kicking.
That's great.

91
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,200
I wish I would have been there to feel
the kicking for the first time.

92
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,000
I got some stuff going on
if you want to feel.

93
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,600
I'll pass, but you look radiant.

94
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,800
I don't want to miss any more baby
stuff. Here's my pager number.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,440
Anytime anything pregnancy-related
happens, use it.

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,680
I don't care if it's 3 a.m.
and you want ice cream.

97
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,400
Can I get a copy of that?

98
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,600
-Are you under the sheet?
-Yes.

99
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,000
Great, let's begin.

100
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,400
How's the pressure?

101
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,320
It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.

102
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,240
Stating the obvious, but thank you.

103
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,400
-And it's not weird, is it?
-No.

104
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,400
That's right, you just enjoy.

105
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,800
Oh, yeah!

106
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,800
-Oh, yeah!
-Okay.

107
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,400
Oh, God, Phoebe!

108
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,600
That's it! That's it, right there!

109
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,440
I wasn't trying to open
your closet, I swear.

110
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,080
Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,
doesn't she? What are you doing?

111
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,400
Monica has a secret closet.
She won't let me see it.

112
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,840
-Why not?
-I don't know! What's she hiding?

113
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
I don't know.

114
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,760
I bet it's Richard.

115
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,440
-What?
-Before you say I'm wrong..

116
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,880
let me ask you something.

117
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,000
When was the last time you saw him?

118
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,360
Why would she keep Richard in here?

119
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,720
Off the top of my head..

120
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,200
maybe she's having her cake
and eating it too.

121
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,680
You being the "cake,"
Richard being the "too."

122
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,840
-That was off the top of your head?
-Yeah.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,480
-Or..
-And here we go.

124
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,000
I saw a movie where there was a door.
Nobody knew what was behind it.

125
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,760
When they finally got it open,
millions of bugs came pouring out..

126
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,360
and they feasted on human flesh!

127
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,960
It wouldn't kill you
to respect your wife's privacy!

128
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,560
Stupid closet full of bugs!

129
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,080
Joey, something feels weird
and not good weird. I don't..

130
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,400
When my sisters were pregnant..

131
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,840
they got weird feelings
and it was always nothing.

132
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,680
-Really?
-Absolutely.

133
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,120
But we'll stop by the hospital
just to be sure. I'll page Ross.

134
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,280
Rach, look at me. Everything's fine.
Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.

135
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
Crushing bones!

136
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,880
Good thing we're going to a hospital.

137
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,640
-Open it.
-Why'd you..

138
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,760
Watch your feet.
There's bugs everywhere.

139
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,440
-So?
-She's fine.

140
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,520
She had Braxton Hicks contractions.
Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.

141
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,520
Mild discomfort? I take it you've had
one of these Braxton thingies?

142
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,440
-Everything's normal?
-Yes.

143
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,760
-There's no danger?
-No.

144
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,000
Contractions can be unnerving,
but she's fine.

145
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,840
Thank you, doctor.
And thank you for being nice and calm.

146
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,880
I wasn't calm! I've never been
more scared in my life.

147
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,920
-You said everything was okay.
-What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

148
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,880
-But everything is okay. I'm fine.
-You sure?

149
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,760
Yes. I got half a mind
to contract that doctor's uterus.

150
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,920
Mild discomfort!
What's he talking about?

151
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,760
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

152
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,920
Your page said, "Come to
the hospital." What happened?

153
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,880
Something called
Braxton Hicks contraction.

154
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,040
That's no big deal.
Most women don't feel them.

155
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,360
No uterus, no opinion.

156
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,920
What's with the candy?

157
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,280
I was at the concession stand
at the movies.

158
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,120
-You went to the movies by yourself?
-Mona!

159
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,040
-I gotta go back in there.
-What's wrong?

160
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,480
-I just gotta..
-No, really, tell me. What's up?

161
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,080
Look, I forgot my underwear.

162
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,520
Thanks for bringing her to the hospital.

163
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,440
Don't worry about it. No big deal.

164
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,280
But still, it should have been me.
I'm the dad.

165
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,440
-Here's information on Braxton Hicks.
-Thanks.

166
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,520
You did the right thing by bringing her in.

167
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,080
You'll make a wonderful father.

168
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,440
Hey, not as good as this guy.
He brought Twizzlers.

169
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,520
-There has got to be a way.
-Easy there, Captain Kirk.

170
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880
-Do you have a bobby pin?
-Yeah.

171
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, no, wait.
I'm not a 9-year-old girl.

172
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,320
Then why do you throw like one?

173
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,720
-Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
-Oh, sure, "Monica."

174
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,520
So how's the inappropriate
crush on Rachel coming?

175
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,000
Really good. I should be ready
to kill myself any day now.

176
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,360
Well, you sure found that quick.

177
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,360
I wish I didn't feel this way about
Rachel. I wish things could be normal.

178
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,320
I love living with her, and
helping out with the baby is amazing.

179
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
But now I think Ross feels left out.

180
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,880
When I took Rachel to the hospital,
the doctor thought I was the father.

181
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,240
You should have seen
the look on Ross' face.

182
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,960
I have no idea what I'm doing.
For all I know, I'm locking it more.

183
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,600
-You try opening it with a credit card?
-That's a good idea.

184
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,280
So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?

185
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,360
-I feel terrible.
-It's not your fault.

186
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,600
What are you gonna do, not take her?
You're doing nothing wrong.

187
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,120
Except for harboring love
for the woman carrying his baby.

188
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,440
Well, there is that.

189
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,360
Richard, if you're in there,
could you pass me my credit card?

190
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,360
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.
That massage felt so good.

191
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,800
No, I got that.

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,560
-Can we make it a weekly appointment?
-Okay.

193
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,680
You should know though,
I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.

194
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,680
-Okay.
-I mean 500.

195
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,560
-What?
-600.

196
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,160
What's going on?

197
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,440
You make sex noises
when you get massaged.

198
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,760
It freaked me out. After a while,
I tried to hurt you. It spurred you on.

199
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,960
You're crazy. There's nothing sexual
about the noises I make.

200
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,960
There's nothing sexual about this?

201
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,520
Oh, God!

202
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,280
What are you looking at?

203
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,000
I mean, hi.

204
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,400
Oh, that's why Alexandra wears earplugs
when she gives me a massage.

205
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,800
It's not because she hates Enya.

206
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,480
This is embarrassing.
I'm never getting a massage again.

207
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,600
Don't let this stop you
from getting massages.

208
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,240
I have lots of clients
that make those noises.

209
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,920
-Really?
-Well, not clients. Lovers.

210
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,160
We'll try it again. Come back,
and we'll work through it.

211
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,080
-You sure?
-Yes.

212
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,320
-I guess.
-Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.

213
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,080
So did you hear something you liked?

214
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,480
Hey, Ross, check it out!
I learned a new trick.

215
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,720
You know, if you stick one hand down your
pants, you're the spitting image of Joey.

216
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,360
Hey, I brought you some lunch.

217
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,640
Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.

218
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,520
-Did you put pickles on this?
-Well, yeah.

219
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,640
What? What? Rach, what?

220
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,760
-What's going on?
-I made her tuna with pickle.

221
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,560
Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.

222
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,600
Giving her pickle is like giving me salad.

223
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm sorry, I didn't know. You okay?

224
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,600
I'm fine, but someone make sure
it's gone when I get out?

225
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,840
I'm on it!

226
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,800
I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.

227
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,160
-It could happen to anyone.
-Not to you. You know this stuff.

228
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,040
I don't know any of it and I'm the father.

229
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,000
I wish I could be more involved, you know?

230
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,240
Well, if anyone is keeping score,
I no longer eat tuna.

231
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,640
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

232
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,200
-Yeah.
-What's up?

233
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,480
Sit down.
I wanna talk about our situation.

234
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,400
Are you breaking up with us?

235
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
The thing is..

236
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,840
because I live with Rachel,
I'm here for a lot of stuff.

237
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,320
And Ross is missing everything. So..

238
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,960
Yeah?

239
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,680
You two should live together.

240
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,760
Are you asking me to move?
You don't want me here?

241
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,200
No, I love living with you.
It just seems that..

242
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,600
if you're gonna have a roommate,
it may as well be the father.

243
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,640
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me
to move in and disrupt his life.

244
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,440
Or he does.

245
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,000
I would love to be around
for you and the baby.

246
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,480
We can just try it,
like on a temporary basis.

247
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,440
-But it's you and me.
-It wouldn't be anything romantic.

248
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,440
I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!

249
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,400
I was supposed to meet her
an hour ago. What is wrong with me?

250
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,760
So, what do you think?

251
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,160
Living with the father of the baby.
It's a little conventional for us.

252
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,200
Yeah, but hey, hey.
You always have liked my building.

253
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,400
And there's more room. I mean,
you could have a closet dedicated to shoes.

254
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,840
Oh, you do know your audience.

255
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,640
-I don't know. Is it crazy?
-No.

256
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,800
Joey, this is a smart idea.

257
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
Well, I was due.

258
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,960
-Let's do it.
-Really?

259
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,280
Rach, that's great. That's great.

260
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,280
And you know what?
Don't worry about any of the moving.

261
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,120
I'll take care of everything.
In fact, I'll start right now.

262
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,760
Ross, Ross. Mona?

263
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,160
Unbelievable.

264
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,960
Not too shabby.
I got this all off myself..

265
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,800
using my wife's tools.

266
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,800
Oh, my God.

267
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,600
How did you get in there?

268
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,880
You're messy.

269
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,960
-No! You weren't supposed to see this!
-I married Fred Sanford.

270
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,760
Chandler, you don't understand.

271
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,640
You know,
how I organize everything, right?

272
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,600
Okay, well this is all of the stuff
that doesn't fit into any category.

273
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,040
So you see, I'm not messy.

274
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,120
I'm just so organized that..

275
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,200
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know.
I'm sick.

276
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,400
No, honey, you're not sick. I don't
love you because you're organized.

277
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,560
I love you in spite of that.

278
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,600
Really?

279
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,280
-Promise you won't tell anyone?
-Yes.

280
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,000
Now that I know, if I've got extra stuff,
can we share the closet?

281
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Well.. It's just..

282
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm afraid you might mess it up.

283
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,320
-Hey.
-Hey.

284
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,240
So Rachel's all moved out?
How you taking it?

285
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,200
I wanted to have a few beers..

286
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,480
but I got rid of those because
Rachel couldn't stand the smell.

287
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,160
I have thrown back a lot
of orange juice with calcium.

288
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,960
It's a couple weeks past its expiration
date, so it's got a bit of a kick.

289
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,760
-Are you okay?
-You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.

290
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,120
I'm better than great. I am good.

291
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:03,000
Now that she's gone, I can do stuff
around here that I couldn't do before.

292
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,000
Like..

293
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,600
I can walk around naked again.

294
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,600
I can..

295
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,200
I can watch porn in the living room.

296
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,680
This is good for me.

297
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,840
I like being on my own.
I'm better off this way.

298
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,360
I'm a lone wolf.

299
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,360
A loner. Alone.

300
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,160
All alone. Forever.

301
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,480
What's a wolf gotta do
to get a hug around here?

302
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,600
That's it, just relax.

303
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,960
-Come on, more.
-Oh, God!

304
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,640
You like that, don't you?

305
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,240
-Yeah, right there.
-Want it there? Take it there, baby.

306
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,840
-Phoebe?
