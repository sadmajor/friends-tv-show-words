1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,560
Previously:

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,280
There's this woman that I like a lot.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,600
But it's complicated.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,040
She was with this other guy
for a long time.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,480
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,640
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he a good guy?

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,400
The best.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,040
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,440
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,240
I do, so much.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,120
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,640
You know what?
You have to go for it.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,480
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,480
It's Rachel.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,040
I'm sorry, did you just say
it's Rachel?

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,640
You like Rachel?

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,600
Yes. I like Rachel.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,960
Rachel?!

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,360
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know..

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,840
You know who else I like? You.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,680
And it doesn't get said enough.
I like you, Ross.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,200
-"Rachel" Rachel?
-It's not a big deal.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
It's not a big deal?
I'm sorry, I just..

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,040
What about the stuff you said?

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,760
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,720
I'm an actor, you know?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,720
As a group, we tend to be
overdramatic.

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,440
I know it's bad.
And I know it's wrong, okay?

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,640
It's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,720
These are just feelings.
They'll go away.

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,400
You know, I gotta go.

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,840
Hey, Ross..

35
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,840
You know, I just have one...
Rachel?!

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,600
Rachel?!

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,440
Okay, she's kicking.

38
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,720
She's growing inside you.

39
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,520
-That was a big one.
-That's the youngest girl to reject me.

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
-You guys!
-Hey there.

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,200
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?

42
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,640
Oh, yes, I do.

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,520
There's one person out there
for everyone.

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,600
You know how you find him?
Stop looking.

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,720
I've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,680
He'll find me.

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,040
And you?

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,200
No. I believe that certain people
are more suited for each other, but..

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,920
-Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
-Good.

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,800
-Why?
-Well, last night, I met Monica's.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,640
What?

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,600
I had a date with this guy.
I swear he's her other half.

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,760
You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?

54
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,720
Well, what's he like?

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,200
-He's tall. He has brown hair.
-Of course.

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,680
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,800
-He works with food.
-Oh, sure. Older?

58
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,400
-Obviously. And he's British.
-I was just gonna ask!

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,880
And he's so centered,
and mature and confident.

60
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,440
It's so sad they never met.

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,040
Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

62
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,920
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.

63
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,000
We're going out again.
I'll find out more.

64
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?

65
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,320
He may not be my soul mate,
but a girl's gotta eat.

66
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,200
Rachel?!

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,880
I didn't know Joey was on JAG.

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
-Hey.
-Hey.

69
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,280
I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,400
I still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
It's like you and me going out,
only weirder.

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,560
I know you're hurting..

73
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,720
but don't say that again.

74
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,360
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

75
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
You don't need to worry.

76
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,200
He'll never tell her how he feels.

77
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,200
If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.

78
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,240
Sure, women never like Joey.
I think he's a virgin.

79
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,040
-He isn't thinking about going for her.
-He's not?

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,800
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,840
It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.

82
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
-Why?
-He wants to leave the country.

83
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,400
He thinks you hate him.

84
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,040
Hate him?

85
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,000
No, I don't hate him.

86
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,240
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

87
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,360
I can't even imagine how hard
this must be for you..

88
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,400
but I don't want you
to lose Joey over it.

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,880
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.

90
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, I'll talk to him.

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,800
I'd do it soon.

92
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,760
He just asked me how to convert
his dollars into Vermont money.

93
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,760
-Hi!
-Hi.

94
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,240
-Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
-Hello.

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,320
Hello, nice to meet you.
How are you?

96
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,080
Soul mate.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,320
-What are you guys doing?
-We had lunch at Adriatica.

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,000
-What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?
-I know! Is this 1985?

99
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,760
-That's what I said! Isn't it strange?
-Not really.

100
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,480
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,000
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

102
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,600
No?

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,440
-What restaurants do you like?
-Octavio. 27-and-7.

104
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,800
-There's this place, Alessandro's.
-Oh, my God! I'm the chef!

105
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,760
You're kidding!
Your food is fantastic!

106
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,880
I want to talk about your menu.
Anyone want coffee?

107
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,240
If you're talking about me,
I'll go with you.

108
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,480
I'll have a mocha-ccino.

109
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,400
What are you doing?

110
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,480
I swear, I didn't know you guys
would be here.

111
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,040
You don't believe in soul mates, so..

112
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,040
I believe in handsome strangers
who hit on my wife.

113
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.

114
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
Phoebe? Good work.

115
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,440
He's great. I love him.

116
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,840
Don't worry, we'll find you
someone else.

117
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,000
I understand if you came by to hit me.
I deserve it.

118
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,400
No, I don't want to hit you.

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,000
What, then? Kick me?

120
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,520
No.

121
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
Bite me?

122
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,240
I don't want to do anything to you.

123
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,560
I just want to say I'm not
mad at you..

124
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,120
and that I certainly
do not hate you.

125
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,800
I just came here to say that.

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
Hey, wait, Ross?

127
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,200
You wanna come in
for a beer or something?

128
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Yeah, sure.

129
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
You got any beer?

130
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,200
All I got is melon stuff
that Rachel left.

131
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,960
Okay.

132
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,280
You need to understand something.

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,200
I am never gonna act
on this Rachel thing, okay?

134
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,040
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.

135
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,760
Thank you.

136
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,760
Anyway, it'll just..

137
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,200
It'll take me a while to get over her.

138
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm not sure how to do that.
I've never been in love, so..

139
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,080
What?

140
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,000
You're in love with her?

141
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,720
-Yeah. I thought you knew that.
-No.

142
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,800
Look, if it helps, I don't want
to feel this way, honest.

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,200
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?

144
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,200
But it just keeps getting harder.

145
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,720
I don't know what to do, you know?

146
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,200
What do I do?

147
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,720
-You need to tell her how you feel.
-That's the green stuff talking.

148
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm serious.
You need to find out where she is.

149
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,000
If she's not where you are,
you can start to move on.

150
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,240
But what if,
and I'm not saying she will be..

151
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,640
If she is where you are..

152
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,120
then my feeling weird
shouldn't stand in the way.

153
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,080
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

154
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,040
If she ends up with somebody else..

155
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,000
the truth is,
she couldn't find a better guy.

156
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,440
Hey, thanks.

157
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,760
-So when are you gonna talk to her?
-Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

158
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,160
I haven't thought about it.
What should I say?

159
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,040
I'm understanding,
but let's not get carried away.

160
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,400
What am I gonna say?

161
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,520
Yeah, tell me about it.

162
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,040
I'm phasing out the wine importing
and focusing more on the cheese.

163
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Cheese, you say?

164
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,480
That's some
pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

165
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,560
-Excuse me?
-Cheese. It's smelly.

166
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,760
You must smell a lot of the time too.

167
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,920
Not really. But with cheese,
I think the smellier, the better.

168
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,640
Me too! Chandler hates it.
I can't have blue cheese in the house.

169
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,800
And you're still married to him?

170
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,280
I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese.

171
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,680
Not even bread. Just cheese.

172
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,720
No, I want the bread.

173
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
And pastries.

174
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,480
And pate.

175
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,360
I'm really not high.
I just used to be fat.

176
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,520
I have a villa in the Loire Valley
you can stay in.

177
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,760
Is it made of cheese?

178
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,040
No. A house made of cheese,
wouldn't that be incredible?

179
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,000
-I'd move in tomorrow!
-Oh, come on!

180
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,800
-Listen to this!
-I'm so sorry.

181
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,160
-What do we do?
-They both want a house of cheese.

182
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,600
I don't know how you fight that.

183
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,920
Okay, okay. I can do this.
I can tell her how I feel.

184
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,400
Okay, stand up straight.

185
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,400
Take a couple deep breaths.

186
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,760
Look confident.

187
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,360
Joey? What's up?

188
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,800
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.

189
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,240
What's up?

190
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,280
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?

191
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,800
I'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?

192
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I just came by to tell you that..

193
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,560
I want to have dinner with you.

194
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,400
Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.

195
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,520
Okay. That's good.

196
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.

197
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,320
Don't you people ever knock?

198
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,480
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
Wouldn't that be nice?

199
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,080
Sure. Set it up.

200
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,400
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.

201
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,760
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

202
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,480
Yeah. Fine. Not perfect.

203
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,520
But good enough.

204
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,520
Jeez, what's with you?

205
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,640
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

206
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,080
-What's going on?
-Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

207
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,400
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.

208
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,680
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.

209
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,800
-You don't believe in soul mates?
-No, but I'm sure "tomahtoes" does.

210
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,040
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

211
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,480
-You don't?
-Nope.

212
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,200
We weren't destined
to end up together.

213
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,880
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.

214
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,680
Some days we work really hard.

215
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,320
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?

216
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,280
No, I've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

217
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,880
-I love you.
-I know.

218
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

219
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,960
I found this place that makes
the greatest jalapeno poppers.

220
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,560
No? They taste so good.

221
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,960
It happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.

222
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,920
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

223
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,960
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, sure.

224
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,240
Look, the reason..

225
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,160
Is it hot in here?

226
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
Why don't you take off your sweater?

227
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,320
This is a nice place..

228
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,160
and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

229
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

230
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
Yeah, sure.

231
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,640
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.

232
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,160
How long have we known each other?

233
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,160
Seven, eight..

234
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,880
Eight years. Wow.

235
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,560
A long time.

236
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
But over the past few weeks, I..

237
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,280
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
but it is mega-jammed in here.

238
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,160
Our specials tonight..

239
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,880
-Could you give us a second?
-Sure.

240
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,360
Second's up!

241
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,920
Not that kind of table.

242
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,560
So you were saying?

243
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,680
I'm not sure.

244
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,280
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.

245
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,760
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half..

246
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,360
and now here we are.

247
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,640
Yeah. Here we are.

248
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
I think I'm falling in love with you.

249
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,320
What?

250
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,120
I'm falling in love with you.

251
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,040
Who are you talking to?

252
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,240
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

253
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,080
Funny. It's funny!

254
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,320
I don't get it.

255
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,800
Okay.

256
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,920
Wow.

257
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,520
Okay, so the specials are..

258
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,200
Are you..?

259
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,600
How did..?

260
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,840
When?

261
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,520
Does it really matter?

262
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,800
Wow. Wow.

263
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,160
It is hot in here.

264
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,000
I know this is a lot.

265
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,360
You don't have to say anything.

266
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,640
You take as much time as you need.

267
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,600
Okay, you gotta say something.

268
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,800
Joey, I love you so much.

269
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,000
-But..
-But.

270
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,200
Joey?

271
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,960
Right. Hey, that's..

272
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,400
That's okay. That's fine.

273
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,320
It's pretty much what I was expecting.

274
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,120
It's no big deal, all right?

275
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,840
-I think I'm gonna go.
-Please don't leave like this.

276
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,640
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

277
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,040
Don't start doing that.

278
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,680
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me..

279
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,800
Oh, there we go!

280
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,160
-Can I?
-Sure.

281
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,440
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose..

282
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,680
Hey, hey.

283
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,000
You can't, okay? Ever.

284
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,560
I'm so sorry.

285
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,720
Please don't be sorry.

286
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,080
Okay? Don't be sorry.

287
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,840
You know, I was only kidding.

288
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,280
Yeah, that was a real good one.

289
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,400
-Is this your table?
-Yeah.

290
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,960
-You'll be here all night.
-I know.

291
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,720
I haven't even read the specials.

292
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,600
What's the matter?

293
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,400
I don't know.
I think maybe one of them is dying.

294
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,520
I kind of hope it's the girl.

295
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,400
The guy is really cute!
