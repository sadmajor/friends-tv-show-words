1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,000
Joey? Are you in there?

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,680
-That's Rachel.
-You have to talk to her.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,440
I can't. Not after the other night.
It's too weird.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,560
Don't tell her I'm here.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,960
Don't eat that!

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,480
-Hey!
-Hey, Rachel.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,120
Is Joey here?

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,320
-I don't see him. You?
-No.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,840
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
Joey? Nope.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,560
Well, at least you make
each other laugh.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,480
-What's up?
-I haven't seen him since he said..

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,240
how he, you know..

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,960
I don't know,
I think he's avoiding me.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,760
Why is that bagel on the floor?

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,840
-We were playing a game.
-Was Chandler naked?

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,080
Sort of like a ring-toss
kind of situation?

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,720
-Sure!
-What? No! No!

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,160
All right, listen. If you see Joey,
will you just tell him that..?

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,080
Tell him I miss him.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,080
-Okay. Did you hear that?
-Yeah. That naked bagel game?

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,080
Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty
small hole.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,120
-You've gotta talk to her.
-I can't.

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,360
You guys don't know what it's like
to get shot down.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,680
I don't know what that's like?

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,600
Until I was 25, I thought the response
to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,040
No rejection?

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,280
I got shot down at fat camp.

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,480
Boy, kids are mean
when they're hungry.

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,720
So, what do I do?

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,000
It's Rachel.
You're gonna never talk to her again?

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,160
It's weird and it's awkward,
but you gotta at least try.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, okay.

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,760
I forgot this was on your..

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,240
We didn't play it!

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,240
I'll look at your tea leaves
and tell your fortune.

36
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,360
-You read tea leaves?
-I've done it for years.

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,680
I actually stopped
because I was so accurate.

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,200
And one of the great joys
of life..

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,320
is its wondrous unpredictability,
you know?

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,360
And also,
tea tends to give me the trots.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,080
-Okay. I'm done. Read mine.
-Okay.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,360
I see a ladder.

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,280
Which can mean either a promotion
or a violent death.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
I'm the head chef.
I can't get promoted.

45
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,320
Who's next?

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm done. Do mine.

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,560
Okay.

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,960
Oh! Okay, I see a circle.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,680
Which can either mean
you're having a baby..

50
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,560
or you'll make
a scientific discovery!

51
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,080
Well, I have been spending
a lot of time in the lab.

52
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,360
-What does yours say, Pheebs?
-All right.

53
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,840
Wow! Yay!

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,040
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy!
And really soon!

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,480
He's gonna be the man of my dreams.

56
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,360
Probably not the guy
I had a dream about last night.

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,120
Has anyone seen my shirt?

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,760
It's a button-down, like
a faded salmon color?

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,160
You mean your pink shirt?

60
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,920
Faded salmon color?

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,520
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,200
I must have left it at Mona's.
I knew it!

63
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,640
I'm sure you can get another one
at Ann Taylor's.

64
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,640
That's my favorite shirt.
I love it.

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,720
Ask Mona to give it back.

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,640
I don't know. I could.

67
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,280
We didn't really end things
on good terms.

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,400
If I went, I'd be ignoring the
one thing she asked me to do..

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,200
jump up my own ass and die.

70
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,120
Oh, wait a second, you guys?

71
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,320
I've been seeing that guy
everywhere I go.

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,840
We take the same bus,
go to the same bookstore.

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,640
Maybe he's the tea guy.

74
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,200
Did you see that?

75
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,920
He totally checked you out!
And he is so cute!

76
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,280
Mine is a picture of the Village
People. What does that mean?

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
Hi.

78
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,400
Hey.

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,400
-Hi.
-Hi.

80
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,960
Tea gives Phoebe the trots!

81
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,160
I thought Joey and I
would be okay..

82
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,800
but we don't know
how to be together.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
By the way,
I've been meaning to say this.

84
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,680
If you guys knew about this,
a heads-up would have been nice.

85
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
Just a little, you know.

86
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,240
"Joey loves you.
Be prepared."

87
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,120
-Sorry.
-Well, for next time.

88
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,920
-It's tough, but things will improve.
-How do you know?

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,440
What if it gets worse and worse..

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,240
to the point where we
can't be in the same room?

91
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,560
I'm not great at the advice.

92
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,040
Can I interest you
in a sarcastic comment?

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,280
Some cheese?

94
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,000
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,920
If I can't find the right case,
I use the nearest one.

96
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,680
-Where is the Cat Stevens CD?
-The James Taylor case.

97
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,480
-Where is that CD?
-I'll save you time.

98
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,080
Two hundred CDs,
not one of them in the right case.

99
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,400
Okay. No need to panic.
Deep breaths, everyone.

100
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,040
We'll just have to put the CDs
in their right cases.

101
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,360
If we do that, we should
come up with some kind of order.

102
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,880
We have to talk this through.

103
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,840
Oh, my God, you have such
problems! I feel so terrible for you!

104
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,560
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.

105
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,920
You're both focusing on
this uncomfortable thing.

106
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,960
Change the subject.

107
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,120
Get him talking about something else.

108
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,800
Yeah, that makes sense.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,160
Maybe you need his advice
on a work problem..

110
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,200
-I could do that.
-Good.

111
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,520
The Miami Vice soundtrack?
Really?

112
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,800
They were just giving those away
at the store.

113
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,960
In exchange for money.

114
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,840
Hey.

115
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,840
I really don't know what to tell you.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,440
Maybe Joey could help you out
with your big work problem.

117
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,800
-What?
-Yeah, Joey, she's..

118
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,600
Rachel's got this big work problem.
It is a head-scratcher.

119
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,520
Know what? If we're gonna make dinner,
we're gonna have to leave.

120
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,960
Yeah, Joey, maybe
you could help her out.

121
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,720
-Okay.
-Oh, and you know what?

122
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,720
While you're helping
solve this problem..

123
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,720
you might want to do something with
your hands. Like, off the top of my head..

124
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,040
maybe put the CDs
in their right cases.

125
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,200
Here we go.

126
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,480
So you have a big work problem?

127
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,680
Yeah. It's, uh..

128
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah, it's, uh..

129
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,760
You know, it's nothing.

130
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,160
Okay.

131
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,240
So I think I'm gonna take off.

132
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,800
No, wait, Joey, it is.
It's something. It's..

133
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,480
It's my boss.

134
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,600
-Yeah?
-Yeah. And, uh..

135
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
And my baby.

136
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,720
Yeah?

137
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,680
My boss wants to buy my baby.

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,640
What? Oh, my God!

139
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,880
I know, I told you,
it's a really big problem!

140
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,680
-He wants to buy your baby?
-Can you believe that?

141
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,560
-That's crazy.
-That's what I told him!

142
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,280
-How did this even happen?
-Well, I'll tell you.

143
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,000
See, my boss and his wife,
they can't have children, so..

144
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,440
And then when we were
at the Christmas party..

145
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,000
he got drunk and said to me,
"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."

146
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,440
When you said it was a problem
about your boss and the baby..

147
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,360
I figured it was
about maternity leave.

148
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Oh. Yeah.

149
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,880
Yeah, that would have been
a much simpler problem.

150
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,040
-Oh, hello.
-Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.

151
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,160
I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.

152
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,080
Hi, Jim-Jim Nelson.
I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.

153
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,920
-We've seen each other a lot lately.
-Yes.

154
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,760
Maybe we'll see each other at
dinner tomorrow. Around 8:00?

155
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,760
Well, maybe we will.

156
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,760
Mona?

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,040
Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be?

158
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,840
Upstream.

159
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,600
Damn, nobody's here
for my good ones.

160
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,000
I am so sorry I spilled wine
all over your shirt.

161
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,200
-It's okay.
-No, it's still wet.

162
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,720
Let me get it out before it sets.
I have something you could wear.

163
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
Here.

164
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
I don't know if I want to wear
a woman's shirt.

165
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,800
-That's a man's shirt.
-Awfully pink.

166
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,720
It's not pink!

167
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,520
Honey, we are so meant
to be together.

168
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,920
-We both have the Annie soundtrack.
-Honey, both yours.

169
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,920
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.

170
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,320
-The work problem?
-It was perfect.

171
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,600
It felt like he was my friend.

172
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,520
-What problem did you say you have?
-Oh, that's not important.

173
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,520
The point is,
I think everything's gonna be okay.

174
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,840
May I help you?

175
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,480
You think you can just buy
my friend's baby?

176
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,760
Isn't it funny how we kept meeting?
It's as if someone wants us together.

177
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
Someone does. Me.

178
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,520
Witty banter. Well done. Good.

179
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,720
-Tell me a little bit about yourself.
-Okay. I'm a masseuse.

180
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,400
-And I used to work at this place..
-Do you like to party?

181
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,360
I like parties.

182
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,920
You're wild, aren't you?

183
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,800
-Yeah, I guess. A little.
-Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.

184
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,240
So anyway..

185
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,560
I've lived in New York,
somewhat wildly, I guess..

186
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,760
for, well, since I was 14.

187
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,240
I'm sorry. I'm staring.

188
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,320
It's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.

189
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,120
-Oh, stop it.
-And your breasts!

190
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,400
Okay.

191
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,360
Look, you're coming on
a little strong.

192
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,280
I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt.

193
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,840
The universe wants us
to be together.

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,960
Why don't we start over?
You can tell me about yourself.

195
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,960
-All right.
-Okay.

196
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,960
I write erotic novels..

197
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,640
for children.

198
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,640
-What?
-They're wildly unpopular.

199
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,280
Oh, my God!

200
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,160
Also, you might like to know
I have a Ph.D.

201
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,120
-Wow! You do?
-Yep. A pretty huge..

202
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,600
All right.

203
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,880
-Hey.
-Joey, honey, listen.

204
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,520
Thanks for talking to me yesterday.
It meant a lot.

205
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,800
Not a problem.
Just so you know..

206
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,280
that guy won't be bothering
you about that baby thing anymore.

207
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,720
-What?
-Let's just say I took care of it.

208
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,600
Let's say more.

209
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Don't worry. I told him, very nicely:

210
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,680
"You don't go buying people's babies!
So back off!"

211
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,040
-What?
-What?

212
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,360
No, no, no!

213
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,520
He doesn't want to buy my baby!
I made that up!

214
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,800
What? Why?

215
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,000
So we would have something
to talk about!

216
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,840
And you couldn't think
of anything else?

217
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,400
You said your boss
wants to buy your baby?

218
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,840
You yelled at my boss!
I'll lose my job! What am I gonna do?

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,720
You could always sell your baby.

220
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,680
I can't believe you brought
my boss into it! I'll be fired!

221
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,640
-You lied to me!
-Well, she told me to!

222
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,080
Chandler has two copies of Annie!

223
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,560
Oh, my God!

224
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,480
-Ross!
-Hello!

225
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,800
What are you doing?

226
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,600
Not touching myself, if that makes
anyone less uncomfortable.

227
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,360
Okay, then. I'll call you.

228
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,360
Morning. You wanted to see me?

229
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,280
Please, come in. Have a seat.

230
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,360
-Look, Mr. Zelner..
-It's best I speak first.

231
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,720
Yeah.

232
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,240
Lee from Human Resources is here
as a witness to our conversation.

233
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,840
Oh, God.

234
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,720
If I in any way implied
that I wanted to buy your baby..

235
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I am sorry. Okay?

236
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,600
Last week, when I asked you
when your due date was..

237
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,960
I certainly did not mean that
I felt that I was "due" your baby.

238
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,120
I want to be very clear..

239
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,480
that I understand
that it's your baby..

240
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
and it is not mine to purchase.

241
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,440
Well, as long as we are clear
about that.

242
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
There it is.

243
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,920
-Not your regular cleaners.
-I know.

244
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,200
That creep goes there.
I had to find a new one.

245
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,960
I have to find a new bank,
adult bookstore, grocery store..

246
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,240
-What?
-A new grocery store.

247
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,560
The universe said I'd meet a nice guy.
I got that?

248
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,440
When I get up there,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

249
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,640
You'll meet someone. If I can meet
a great guy, so can you.

250
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,600
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.

251
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,720
-You didn't have to come in.
-You kidding?

252
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,640
This is where they get out stains.
This is like Disneyland for me.

253
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,080
I'm gonna be over here watching
the dance of the clean shirts.

254
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,160
Excuse me.
I think you dropped..

255
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,720
-Wow!
-What?

256
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,400
Sorry.
You're just so incredibly beautiful.

257
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,560
Well, I'm sorry about that too.
But what are you gonna do?

258
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't think I'm crazy,
but I was meant to pick this up.

259
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,960
-Do you believe in that kind of thing?
-A little.

260
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,160
Now you're talking.

261
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,800
-Want to go for coffee?
-I'd love to. Let me tell my friend.

262
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,240
An ink stain!
Can I watch how you get this out?

263
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
She must have left.

264
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,240
-So? What happened?
-It's all gonna be okay.

265
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,280
They're so happy I'm not suing, I got
an extra month paid maternity leave.

266
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,520
So long as I understand the money
should not be construed..

267
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,880
as a down payment on this
or any other child.

268
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,760
Ralph Lauren is going
out of their way..

269
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,240
to show they're not
in the baby-buying business.

270
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,080
-Give us a minute?
-Kicking me out of my living room?

271
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,200
Yeah.

272
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,400
I'll be in there.

273
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,920
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I was just trying to make things..

274
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,480
I know. I know.

275
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,880
It kind of worked.

276
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,440
I don't know about you,
but I haven't thought about our thing.

277
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,280
Yeah, you're right.

278
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,640
Yeah. It's kind of been
like "us" again, a little bit.

279
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,960
-Yeah, I know. I've missed that.
-Me too.

280
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,560
I haven't thought about
how I put myself out there..

281
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,360
and said that stuff.
How you didn't feel the same..

282
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,360
and how it was really awkward.

283
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,640
My gynecologist tried to kill me.

284
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,040
Item J437-A.

285
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,080
Color: winterberry.

286
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,840
Hi, listen.
Come here. Come..

287
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.

288
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,880
But what did I tell you about leaving
your key outside the door like that?

289
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,480
I mean, you're lucky it was me
and not someone else.

290
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,560
I guess lucky is too strong a word.

291
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,400
Anyway, Mona, I'm really, really sorry.
It's just..

292
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,200
Listen, you don't have to apologize.
I understand why you were there.

293
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,560
-You do?
-Yeah. You still have feelings for me.

294
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,360
To be honest,
I still have feelings for you.

295
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,240
I wish we could work it out,
but we can't.

296
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,360
It's too complicated with you
and Rachel and the baby. I just..

297
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,480
It just wasn't meant to be.

298
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,680
Oh, God. You're right.

299
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,920
Ross, we have to be strong.

300
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,160
Okay, I'm gonna go.

301
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,720
Can I? To remember you?

302
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,480
No.
