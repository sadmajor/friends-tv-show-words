1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,080
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors!

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,920
You did the windows! I have been begging
you for months! And you did, you cleaned.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,000
-And nagging works!
-No, I didn't actually do this.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,840
Oh, no. Was I cleaning
in my sleep again?

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,440
No, it wasn't you.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,240
-Well, then, who?
-I got a maid. Yay!

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,080
I hope by "maid" you mean "mistress"
because if some other woman was cleaning..

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,720
Now, honey, I know you don't like
to relinquish control.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,240
"Relinquish" is just a fancy word
for "lose."

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,640
She's nice, and she mentioned that she
adored the way you arranged the sponges.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,880
Did she really say that?

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,640
Yes, I distinctly remember because
I thought it was a joke.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
-Now, just give her a chance, okay?
-Fine, I can do it.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,440
-What's the matter?
-Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean.

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,720
Whose cell phone is that?
It's just so annoying. Everywhere you go.

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,680
I think it's coming from your bag.

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,280
I never get calls!

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,080
Hello?

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,160
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween
party. Ursula's fiance.

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,840
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
Wait, how'd you get this number?

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,120
I have a friend who's a cop,
and he got it for me.

22
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,160
Wow. What an incredible violation
and wonderful surprise!

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,360
Listen, I just.. I thought you should know
I broke up with Ursula.

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,200
Oh, you did?
He did it, he did it!

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,680
-What did he do?
-I'm talking!

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Anyway, I was wondering if you were
the sort of person who eats lunch?

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,280
Are you asking me out?

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,800
Because it'd be kind of weird since you
just broke up with my sister.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,480
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Bye.

30
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,480
No, no. Wait! I was just saying that
so you'd think I was a good person.

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,480
Fight for me.

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,280
I won't take "no" for an answer.

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,920
Not great, but we can
work on it at lunch.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,280
I can be at your apartment
in two hours.

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,800
Great. How do you know where I live?

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,480
I've got friends too.

37
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,880
Okay, bye.

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,040
Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,680
This day is really gonna be so much better
than I thought it was gonna be.

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,680
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.

41
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,000
So apparently I'm available
for lunch.

42
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,720
I can't. I'm busy.
I'm apartment hunting.

43
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,320
You're moving?

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,480
I can't live with Joey
once the baby comes.

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,240
I don't want my child's first words
to be, "How you doing?"

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
So does Joey know you're moving?

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,000
I haven't discussed it with him,
but I know he'll be relieved.

48
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,920
Last week, he brought this girl over,
and I talked to her about morning sickness.

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,400
Then I showed her pictures
from my pregnancy book.

50
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,080
-That's not really porn?
-Not so much.

51
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,160
I heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.

52
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,080
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,680
I don't know, but how great would that be?
You living in my building?

54
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,760
I could take care of the baby,
I could come over whenever I want..

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,440
with your permission.

56
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,480
That really would be great.
Well, can we see it?

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,120
Maybe we shouldn't.
I mean, if she just died this morning.

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,520
Yeah. No. No, you're right.

59
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,480
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

60
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,200
Yes?

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
Hi. I'm Ross Geller.
I live in the building.

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,880
And I'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.

63
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,080
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and I am so sorry for your loss.

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,440
-She didn't pass away.
-What?

65
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,080
-My mother's still alive.
-Oh, thank God!

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,480
It looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning, but she's a tough old bird.

67
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
Are you close with her?

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,880
Of course. She and I would
talk all the time..

69
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,160
in the laundry room.

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,880
You speak Dutch?

71
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,680
You know, I would,
but it's just too painful.

72
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,480
So she's really not dead.

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,880
No. She's hanging in there.

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,760
Could you tell me, is she hanging in
in a one-bedroom or a two?

75
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?

76
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,320
Oh, well..
I make it myself.

77
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,520
It's two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. The secret ingredient is..

78
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,680
You know what? We just met.

79
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,720
Okay. I'm gonna go get the clothes
from the laundry room now.

80
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,400
When I come back,
I'll clean behind the refrigerator.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
I love her.

82
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,280
I'll be back in a minute.

83
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,960
Okay.

84
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,480
-See? I told you.
-She stole my jeans!

85
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,680
What?

86
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,880
I've been looking for them all week,
and she is wearing them.

87
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,440
So she stole your pants and then
came back and wore them in front of you?

88
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,480
Don't you see?
It's the perfect crime!

89
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,640
She must have been
planning this for years!

90
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,080
I'll prove it to you, okay.

91
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,200
I dropped a pen in my lap, and it left
an ink stain on the crotch.

92
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,840
When she comes back, I will find it
and show you that stain!

93
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,480
Isn't it possible the company that sold
the jeans made more than just the one pair?

94
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,800
I guess.

95
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,880
Shouldn't we give her the benefit of the
doubt before we snoop around her crotch?

96
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,520
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give
her my secret ingredient.

97
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,000
Out of curiosity,
what is your secret ingredient?

98
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,360
Yeah.

99
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,480
-Hi.
-Come in. I'm so glad you're here.

100
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Yeah. Me too.

101
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,120
Not in the shaky, angry way
that you are, though.

102
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,400
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.
I had to get the engagement ring back.

103
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,760
Just seeing her brought it all back.

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,160
All the lies, the way she used me.

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,480
I just.. I get so angry,
just looking at her..

106
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,080
-Face.
-Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm sorry. It's just,
when I look at you..

108
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,480
I see her.

109
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,080
And when I see her,
I get a little bit angry.

110
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,760
So where do you wanna eat?

111
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,720
Not that I'm not enjoying
watching you flip out.

112
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,480
Sorry.

113
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,600
-Maybe this is too weird.
-Wait.

114
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,240
There's only a problem
when I look at you.

115
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,240
I got it. I got it.

116
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,400
No, don't tear out your eyes!

117
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,080
-I was just gonna take out my lenses.
-Oh, yeah. Try that.

118
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,640
So is that better?

119
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Not really.

120
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,240
You're blurry, but you still
look like Ursula. You're "Blursula."

121
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,800
Okay, wait. Maybe..

122
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,240
If I just don't look at you
for a while.

123
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,640
See? It works. I'm not angry at
all anymore. This is a great date!

124
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,200
Yeah, not so much.

125
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,480
It's kind of hard
to have a conversation.

126
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,440
Oh, no.
Sure, we can have a conversation.

127
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,840
Tell me a little
something about yourself.

128
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, me?

129
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,800
Look, Eric, turn around.

130
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,520
I like you, but it shouldn't be
this hard. This is our first date.

131
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,000
First dates are supposed to be
about excitement and electricity and..

132
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,520
"He just touched my hand,
did he mean to?" and first kisses..

133
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
Second kisses.

134
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,800
Thanks for the coffee, or:

135
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Yeah, we're done.

136
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Hey, Ross. You wanna go see
that new IMAX movie on tide pools?

137
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
-Really?
-No.

138
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,400
But I got Knicks tickets
for you, me and Chandler.

139
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,920
Sweet!

140
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,240
And then afterwards,
we can go to a strip joint.

141
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
-Really?
-No.

142
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,320
All right, let's go.

143
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
I have to stop by my place.

144
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,720
To tape the game? You do this every
time. You're not gonna be on TV!

145
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,680
No, I have to see if this apartment
became available.

146
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,160
-You're switching apartments?
-It's not for me, it's for Rachel.

147
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,320
-She has an apartment.
-When the baby comes, she's gonna move.

148
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,440
-She is?
-Yeah.

149
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,000
You didn't expect her
to live there with the baby?

150
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,760
I didn't really think about it.

151
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,960
Hey, Gunther, you're an ezel.

152
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,280
Damn it!

153
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,440
-Nice jeans.
-Oh, thanks.

154
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,880
-I like your top.
-Oh. You're not getting it.

155
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,880
-What happened?
-Oh. I fell asleep!

156
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,440
I was thinking about taking
my lunch break.

157
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,360
Will you do the top of the cabinets?
That'll work up your appetite for lunch.

158
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,280
All right.

159
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,280
Hello.

160
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,360
What's going on?

161
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,280
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid
before. Is this not okay?

162
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,680
I don't understand.

163
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,240
Why was your head
just between my legs?

164
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,120
That's a fair question.

165
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Well, my head was
between your legs..

166
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,480
because I find you
very attractive.

167
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,920
Are you coming onto me?

168
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,240
Apparently.

169
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,480
-Hey.
-Hey.

170
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,280
-How was the game?
-It was okay. I ate way too much.

171
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,800
I was talking to Ross, and he said
you were looking for a new place.

172
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah. Hopefully across the street.
If certain Dutch people would just let go.

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,720
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.

174
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,520
Joey, I have to go.
There's no room for a baby here.

175
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,120
No room? It's a baby.
It's, like, this big.

176
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,200
You could put it over here.

177
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,400
Or we could put it right here.
It's cute, right?

178
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,920
Or put it over here.
You wouldn't even notice it.

179
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,320
"Where's the baby?"
"Oh, it's right over.."

180
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,640
Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.

181
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,120
A baby changes everything.
They cry all the time.

182
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,920
Imagine bringing home some girl and
trying to score with a screaming baby.

183
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,480
I could use a challenge.
It's getting pretty easy.

184
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,320
It's so sweet that you want me
to stay, but I can't.

185
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,520
It would disrupt your entire life.

186
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,920
It's just..
I love living with you so much.

187
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,080
-I wish things didn't have to change.
-I know.

188
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,120
You know, I blame Ross for this.

189
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,520
I do too, a little bit.

190
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm gonna miss you.

191
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,680
You're the hottest roommate
I ever had.

192
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, no, I have to go.
I have a massage appointment.

193
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,960
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
I'll pay you.

194
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,320
No, I've gotten in trouble
for that before.

195
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,880
-I'll see you later?
-Absolutely.

196
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,240
I love the way you kiss.

197
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,920
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!
You'll see.

198
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,480
Hey.

199
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,320
-Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.
-How come?

200
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,200
Because I put my head
between her legs.

201
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,200
-To see her pants?
-They're my pants!

202
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Are you sure?
Did you see the stain?

203
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,440
No. I was getting into position,
and then everything went dark.

204
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,360
She is not stealing from us, okay.
Will you let this go?

205
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,320
Fine.

206
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,800
-She's wearing my bra!
-Oh, dear God!

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,600
My pink, flowered bra!
I recognize the strap!

208
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,960
Yet you don't recognize
that you're crazy?

209
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,640
Here's the plan. I'm going to leave,
and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.

210
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,520
Here's another plan. No.

211
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,840
I would do it, but she thinks
I'm attracted to her.

212
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,520
-Why?
-Did you not hear where my head was?

213
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,000
We're a team.
We're in this together.

214
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,920
I fear a jury will see it
the same way.

215
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,240
Do this for me. I catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.

216
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,560
You see that?

217
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,200
Do you see this?

218
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,960
All right, yes.
Okay. I get your point.

219
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,880
But if it's not her bra, will you
just let the woman clean?

220
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:55,240
Yes. You'll know it's mine because on
the right cup, there's a very noticeable rip.

221
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,120
You need new clothes.

222
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,600
-Hi. How is she?
-It's not looking good.

223
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,840
Well, I brought her some bloemen.

224
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,520
That's so sweet. Would you like to say
goodbye? It would mean a lot to her.

225
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,920
Oh, I don't know that it would.

226
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,520
-Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
-All right, then.

227
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,120
-Hey!
-Welcome back.

228
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,000
-Shall we pick up from where we left off?
-I'm still tired from this afternoon.

229
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,320
-Why?
-The sex.

230
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,360
-What sex?
-Our sex.

231
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,840
We didn't have sex.

232
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,480
If I didn't have sex with you, I had sex
with somebody that looked like..

233
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,720
-You had sex with Ursula?
-A little bit.

234
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,840
She walked in, I thought she was you
and I kissed her and..

235
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,120
-You didn't notice different clothes?
-I was just so excited to see you.

236
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,400
-This is too weird.
-No, it's not. I don't wanna lose you.

237
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,440
It's like I was saying to Ursula
when I was making love..

238
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,720
Yeah. It's too weird.

239
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,640
So I guess this is it.

240
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,840
Yeah.

241
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,120
Maybe it's for the best.

242
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,000
-You smell just like her.
-Yeah, so do you.

243
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,080
-What are you doing?
-I'm leaning.

244
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,680
This is where I lean.

245
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,240
Okay.

246
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,920
-Brenda, a bee!
-What?

247
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,520
It's flown into your blouse, and you better
undo your buttons lest it sting you.

248
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,800
-I think I know what's going on here.
-You do?

249
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,920
Look, I know it must be hard
that your wife is a lesbian..

250
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,320
but it's wrong. You're married.

251
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,640
-I totally understand.
-Okay, good.

252
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,440
Could I just see your bra?

253
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,440
Hi.

254
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,880
-Where'd you get those jeans?
-You gave them to me.

255
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,720
-No, I didn't!
-All right, I took them.

256
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,480
I figured it'd be okay because
you've got a big ink stain on the crotch.

257
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,320
-Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
-What bra?

258
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,120
-The pink one with the flowers.
-You mean the one you're wearing?

259
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,200
I quit!

260
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,240
Sounds about right.

261
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,120
What is this?

262
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
This is just to give you an idea.

263
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,280
We can put screens here
so that the baby has privacy..

264
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,440
and maybe a mobile over the crib..

265
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,320
and here's a baby monitor which, till the
baby comes, we can use as walkie-talkies.

266
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,400
You're so sweet!

267
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,120
Oh, my God!
And you gave the baby Hugsy!

268
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,560
That's really just to show
where the baby would go.

269
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,200
Why don't I hold on to him
so there's no confusion.

270
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,200
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.
It's gonna be loud.

271
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,880
-I'm loud.
-It's gonna be up all night.

272
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,240
-I'm up all night.
-It's gonna poop.

273
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,720
Hello!

274
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,720
What about all the women?

275
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,520
If I'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand a baby..

276
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,760
then maybe I don't wanna
be with that woman.

277
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,520
Or maybe we'll do it
in the bathroom of the club!

278
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,840
But I won't say stuff
like that around the baby.

279
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,080
Joey, are you sure?

280
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah. Look, I know sometimes
it'll be hard, okay..

281
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,360
but it'll also be really,
really great.

282
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,680
Please, Rachel,
I really want you to stay.

283
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,280
I want me to stay too. Thank you.

284
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,800
-Joey, look at this crib. It's so cute.
-I know. I found it on the street.

285
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,920
Are you..? Really?
This is in such good condition.

286
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,320
Whoa! What's under the cover?

287
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,760
-I don't know.
-It's moving.

288
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,160
It's got a tail! Get it out of here!

289
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,920
Okay!

290
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Well, the old lady died.
And how do I know?

291
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,960
Because her dying wish
was for one last kiss.

292
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,720
And because I'm such a strong,
strapping alleenstaande..

293
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,760
I had to carry her body to the lobby.

294
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,680
You know, and she was
not a slight woman.

295
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,080
But I don't care, because
you got the apartment. Yes!

296
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,040
Yeah. I think I'm gonna stay here.

297
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,240
Isn't that great?

298
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,920
What..? You..
But.. Bu..
