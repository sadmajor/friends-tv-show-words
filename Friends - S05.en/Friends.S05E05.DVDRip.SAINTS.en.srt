1
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,346
Monica?

2
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,885
What time is it?

3
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,586
Nine.

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,327
But it's dark out.

5
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,728
That's because you always
sleep till noon, silly.

6
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,367
This is what nine looks like.

7
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,936
I guess I'll get washed up then.

8
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,067
Watch that sunrise.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,078
I'm getting tired of always
sneaking around.

10
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:54,583
Me too. What if we went away
for the weekend? No interruptions.

11
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,779
We could be naked
the entire time.

12
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,359
All weekend?
That's a whole lot of naked.

13
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,929
I'll say I have a conference
and you can have a chef thing.

14
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,123
I wanted to go to this
culinary fair in Jersey!

15
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,461
Okay.
You know you're not, though.

16
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,432
-Let's go.
-Okay. Wait.

17
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,071
What about Joey?

18
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,447
The One with the Kips

19
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:15,133
I'm going to a culinary fair
in Jersey this weekend.

20
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,031
How weird! Chandler just said
he's got a conference there.

21
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,708
That's funny. Seems like
Chandler's conference could've been...

22
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,639
...in Connecticut or Vermont.

23
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,213
I'm not in charge of where
the conference is held.

24
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,578
Do you want people to think it's fake?
It's a real conference.

25
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,589
-Is Rachel here?
-No, she's out shopping.

26
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,119
-Damn!
-What's going on?

27
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,821
I told Emily to come.

28
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:51,264
And I just need to, you know,
talk to Rachel about it.

29
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,129
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,571
When Emily comes,
you won't see Rachel anymore?

31
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,873
I'm focusing on the
"I get to see my wife" part...

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,981
...and not on the part
that makes me do this.

33
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,613
So you'll never be
in a room together?

34
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,517
How will that even work?

35
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,589
I have no idea.
I mean...

36
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,886
But I assure you,
I will figure it out.

37
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,495
It doesn't seem like it'll work.

38
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,864
Hi, guys.

39
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,497
What's going on?

40
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,007
We're flipping Monica's mattress.

41
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,674
So I'm thinking, basically,
we pick it up and then we flip it.

42
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,280
That's better than my way.

43
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,581
Hey guys, would you flip mine too?

44
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,416
Oh, man.

45
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,255
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.

46
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,931
So, Rach?

47
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,065
You know how Emily's coming?

48
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,900
Oh, yeah. I know.

49
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,766
Can you hear anything?

50
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,969
Yeah, somebody just said,
"Can you hear anything?"

51
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,112
Hey, Joey's ass.

52
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,578
What are you doing?

53
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,224
Remember when they fought
and broke up...

54
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,486
...and we were stuck here
all night with no food?

55
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,996
When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,
I figured it'd happen again.

56
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,264
So I hid this in here.

57
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,067
Candy bars, crossword puzzles...

58
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,138
Mad Libs! Mine!

59
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,505
-Okay, "Name of someone in room."
-Chandler.

60
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,407
Come on, seriously.

61
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,542
What do you got in here?
Magazines, Doritos

62
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,587
Condoms?

63
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,190
You don't know how long
we'll be in here.

64
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,586
We may have to
repopulate the Earth.

65
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,729
And condoms are the way to do that?

66
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,295
Anyway, it all boils down to this.

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,168
-The last time I talked to Emily
-Oh, my God! Our dog died!

68
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:17,013
-What?
-Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog!

69
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,516
LaPooh's still alive?

70
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,392
Sorry.

71
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:31,259
It says he was hit by
an ice cream truck and dragged for...

72
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,658
...nineteen blocks!

73
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,770
-Oh, my God.
-Sweetie, we heard you crying.

74
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,836
-Please don't cry.
-It's LaPooh!

75
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,440
I know, it's LaPooh right now
but it'll get better.

76
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,446
I can't believe it! We're here!

77
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,517
Chocolates on the pillows!
I love that!

78
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,626
You should live with Joey.
Rolos everywhere.

79
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,357
This is so great.
No one's gonna bother us.

80
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,261
And we're gonna do it.

81
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,994
I'm gonna do it with Monica!

82
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,136
Chandler, stop yelling
that you and I are gonna do it!

83
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,903
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

84
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,781
Oh, yes!

85
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,586
Get in here.
There's a high-speed car chase on!

86
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,615
We're switching rooms.

87
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,551
Oh, dear God!
They gave us glasses!

88
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,561
The glasses have lipstick on them.

89
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,287
Who knows what else
they didn't change?

90
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,265
You wanna switch rooms
because they didn't switch the glasses?

91
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,133
I didn't wanna say anything,
but the carpet smells too.

92
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:52,442
I want this weekend to be perfect.
We can change rooms, can't we?

93
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,072
Okay, but let's do it now.
Chopper Five just lost its feed!

94
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,595
Forget it.

95
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:23,971
You know how there was something
I wanted to talk to you about?

96
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,303
Oh, yeah.

97
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,345
I'm trying to work
things out with Emily.

98
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,283
Well, there's this...

99
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,454
...one thing.

100
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,083
Here goes.

101
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,630
I made a promise that

102
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,363
-What?
-Your nose is bleeding.

103
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,125
-Oh, God!
-You're bleeding.

104
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,033
Oh, not again. This happened when
my grandfather died.

105
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,600
Sorry.

106
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,470
Gross.

107
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:02,136
Okay. So I'm sorry.
What did you want to tell me?

108
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,654
Sorry. Sorry.

109
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,529
I can't see you anymore.

110
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,665
I know, it's ridiculous.
I can't see you, either. All right.

111
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,829
I'm just gonna go shove
a bunch of tissues in my nose.

112
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,204
Hey, do you wanna tell me while I do that?

113
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,004
I'm good.

114
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:38,278
-I think you'll like this room more.
-Okay, great.

115
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,284
They say he's only got
half a tank left.

116
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:48,951
Half a tank? Still lots
of high-speed chasing to do!

117
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,360
-I'll bet he's heading for Canada.
-They always do.

118
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,390
-We're switching rooms again.
-What? Why?

119
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,901
This has a garden view.
We paid for an ocean view.

120
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:03,541
Our last ocean-view room
was unacceptable to you.

121
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,536
-The carpet smelled.
-Like ocean?

122
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,937
No, like feet.

123
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:15,153
Excuse me. Can I talk to you
over here for just a second?

124
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,123
These clowns want to take us
for a ride. I won't let them.

125
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,298
We're not a couple of suckers.

126
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,694
I hear you, Mugsy.

127
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,071
All these rooms are fine.

128
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,866
Just pick one so I can watch the

129
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:39,805
Have a perfect, magical
weekend together with you?

130
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,918
Oh, man, he almost hit a gas truck.

131
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,646
Do you ever watch Baywatch?

132
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,796
-This one I like.
-Nothing. Nothing. It's over. Damn it!

133
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,992
This is regularly scheduled
programming!

134
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,037
-I wanted to see them talk to his neighbors.
-Well, I'm standing right here...

135
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,734
-...you could talk to me.
-You didn't know him.

136
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,111
Can we turn the TV off?

137
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,076
Do we really want to spend
the weekend like this?

138
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,411
Am I getting in the way
of the room-switching fun?

139
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,184
Don't blame me for tonight.

140
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,515
Who should I blame?
The nice bellman?

141
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,191
Or the idiot who thought
he could drive...

142
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,328
...from Albany to Canada
on half a tank of gas?

143
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,663
Do not speak ill of the dead.

144
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:40,362
We're supposed to be spending
a romantic weekend together.

145
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,833
What's the matter?

146
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,666
I just want to watch
a little television.

147
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,674
Jeez, relax, Mom.

148
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,842
What did you say?

149
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,713
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."

150
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:02,618
You know what, Chandler?
You like fast getaways? Watch this.

151
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:07,358
I don't like fast getaways,
I like car chases.

152
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,169
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey.

153
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,713
I've been wanting to tell you something
and I just have to get it out.

154
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,408
Okay. What's up?

155
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,043
Okay, before I tell you
I just have to know...

156
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,918
...is your nose okay?

157
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,891
Are all the other family pets in good health?

158
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,623
Well, Davey's still pining after LaPooh...

159
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,529
...but, you know, he's a tough little turtle.

160
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,301
You know how you said to do
whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

161
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,603
Yeah, I told you to give Emily
whatever she wants.

162
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:58,740
And while that was good advice,
you should know that what she wants...

163
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,591
...is for me not to see you anymore.

164
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:13,696
That's crazy! You can't do that.
What are you going to tell her?

165
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,036
Oh, my God!

166
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,335
You've already agreed to this.

167
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,270
It's awful, I know.

168
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,678
But I have to do this
if I want my marriage to work.

169
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:36,321
And I do. I have to make
this marriage work. I have to.

170
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,397
But the good thing is, we can still
see each other until she gets here.

171
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,535
Lucky me! Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!

172
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,071
That's the best news I've heard
since LaPooh died!

173
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:03,881
You have no idea what a nightmare
this has been. This is so hard.

174
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,480
Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?

175
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:10,451
-Let me make this easier for you.
-What are you doing?

176
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,886
-Storming out.
-It's your apartment.

177
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,583
Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!

178
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,770
Damn Rolos!

179
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,204
You're back!
How was your conference?

180
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,678
It was terrible. I fought with
my colleagues the entire time.

181
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,681
Are you kidding with this?

182
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,750
So your weekend was a bust?

183
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,120
No, I got to see Donald Trump
waiting for an elevator.

184
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:52,322
You know, at the Taj Mahal
he has his own private glass elevator.

185
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,955
That's right. Made by Otis Elevators.

186
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,591
And they don't usually do glass.

187
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,037
What kinds of stuff do you know?

188
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,976
You're back too.

189
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,575
Could I talk to you for a second?

190
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,839
-How was your chef thing?
-It was awful.

191
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,643
Some people don't
appreciate good food.

192
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,615
Maybe the food tasted good at first...

193
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,916
...but then made everybody vomit
and have diarrhea.

194
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,465
How much was the room?
I'll pay my half.

195
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,693
Fine. $300.

196
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:32,960
$300?

197
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,265
Just think of it as $25 per room.

198
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,541
What are you guys woofing about?

199
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,547
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!

200
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,322
I was only stealing it back,
the one that she stole from me.

201
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,584
Stealing and now lying.

202
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,822
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

203
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,157
...I constantly find myself
without 20s, and you...

204
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,197
...always have lots.

205
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,904
You should've seen
the look on her face.

206
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,667
I don't want Rachel to hate me.
I don't know what to do.

207
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,006
-You want my advice?
-Yes. Please.

208
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,873
-You won't like it.
-That's okay.

209
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,982
You got married too fast.

210
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,989
-That's not advice.
-I told you.

211
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,159
I'm going to the bathroom.

212
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:37,198
If anyone asked me to give up
any of you, I couldn't do it.

213
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,325
Me neither.

214
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,269
Maybe I could do it.

215
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,775
I know you guys heard about
me and Ross.

216
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:53,451
But I've been obsessing about it
and would love not to talk about it.

217
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,779
I don't know if this falls
under that category...

218
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,115
...but Ross is right back there.

219
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,022
-That's not Ross.
-Not that guy.

220
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,058
He does look like him, though.

221
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,360
Ross is in the bathroom.

222
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,569
Oh, my God! It's happening.
It's already started. I'm Kip.

223
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,931
Yeah, you're not Kip.

224
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,401
Do you even know who Kip is?

225
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,810
Who cares? You're Rachel.

226
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,546
Who's Kip?

227
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,441
My old roommate.
We all hung out together.

228
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,586
Oh, that poor bastard.

229
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,950
You told me the story.
He and Monica dated.

230
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:37,423
When they broke up, you all
promised you'd stay his friend.

231
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,257
And what happened?
He got phased out.

232
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,128
-You won't be phased out.
-Of course I am.

233
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,795
It won't happen to Ross. He's your
brother, your college roommate.

234
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,000
Kip didn't even have to be Kip.
We handled that all wrong.

235
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,440
It was a long time ago.

236
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:58,448
And it was before you and me were around.
They didn't know what they were doing.

237
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:03,044
Chandler had a mustache,
for crying out loud.

238
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,217
It was just a matter of time.

239
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,359
I just assumed Phoebe
would be the one to go.

240
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,963
You live far away,
you're not related.

241
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,633
You lift right out.

242
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,467
Hey, Mr. Bing.

243
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,641
That hotel you stayed at called.

244
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,749
Someone left an eyelash curler
in your room.

245
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,082
Yes, that was mine.

246
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,820
I figured you met
a girl and she left it.

247
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,758
That would have made more sense.

248
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,797
I don't even feel like
I know you anymore.

249
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,327
All right, I'm just going
to ask you this one time.

250
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,938
Whatever you say,
I'll believe you.

251
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,140
Were you or were you not...

252
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,835
...on a gay cruise?

253
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,866
I'm sorry about the whole
"lifting out" thing.

254
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,768
You gotta come with me.

255
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,540
-Where?
-Wherever I go.

256
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,209
You and me, we'll start a new group.
We're the best ones.

257
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,107
Okay, but try to get Joey too.

258
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,453
Phoebe, do you mind if I
speak to Rachel alone?

259
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,886
Sure.

260
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,224
Bye, Ross.

261
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,897
Forever.

262
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,374
Why are you here?
Isn't this against the rules?

263
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,204
I talked to Monica.

264
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,483
Look, I'm the one
who made the choice.

265
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,380
I'm the one who's making
things change.

266
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,090
So I should be the one to,
you know, step back.

267
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,327
No, no, it's okay. Really.

268
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,462
Plenty of people just see their
sisters at Thanksgiving...

269
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,394
...their college roommates
at reunions...

270
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,502
...and Joey at Burger King.

271
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,667
Is that better?

272
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,278
No, it's not better.

273
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,845
I still don't get to see you.

274
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:54,119
What would you do?
If you were me, what would you do?

275
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,864
First, I'd have said
the right name at my wedding.

276
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,975
I can't believe this.

277
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,378
I know.

278
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,711
I am so sorry.

279
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,120
I know that too.

280
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,223
Hey, Rach?

281
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:40,871
Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said
you want to talk to me about a trip?

282
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,975
I just came over to drop off...

283
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,848
...nothing.

284
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,921
So that weekend kind of sucked.

285
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,921
Yeah, it did.

286
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,720
So I guess this is over?

287
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,561
You know, you and me.
I mean, it had to end sometime.

288
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,103
Why exactly?

289
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,602
Because of the weekend.
We had a fight.

290
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,341
Chandler, that's crazy.

291
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,774
If you always gave up
after a fight...

292
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,708
...you'd never be with anyone
longer than

293
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,285
This isn't over?

294
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,091
You are so cute!

295
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,461
No, no. It was a fight.

296
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:46,933
You deal with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.

297
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,366
Really? Okay, great!

298
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,540
Welcome to an adult relationship.

299
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,751
We're in a relationship?

300
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,788
I'm afraid so.

301
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,825
I heard you saw Donald Trump
at your convention.

302
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,160
Saw him waiting for an elevator.

303
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,164
Can I use your eyelash curler?
I lost mine.

304
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,808
It's in the bathroom.

305
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,179
Can I talk to you for a second?

306
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,494
Yes.

307
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,599
Yes.

308
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,169
You?

309
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,432
And you?

310
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,109
But you cannot tell anyone.
No one knows.

311
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,175
But how? When?

312
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,012
-It happened in London.
-In London!

313
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,484
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

314
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:14,385
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone!

315
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,252
You can't.

316
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,730
-Please. Now, I know this is hard.
-It is. It hurts.

317
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,195
We just don't want to deal with
telling everyone.

318
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,874
Please just promise you won't tell.

319
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,673
All right.

320
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,015
Man, this is unbelievable!

321
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,116
I mean, it's great!

322
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,945
But...

323
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,450
I know. It's great!

324
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,184
I don't want to see that!

325
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,395
We're so stupid.

326
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:58,196
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey!

327
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:07,371
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis
is called the overhand Phoebe.

328
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:12,149
If you win, slap your opponent
on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!'"

329
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,884
That's cute.
We really all enjoyed it.

330
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,213
-But it doesn't count.
-For what?

331
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,791
Just count in our heads
as good Mad Libs.

332
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,129
-I gotta go.
-Fun's over.

333
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,958
Wait, if we follow the rules...

334
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,498
...it's still fun
and it means something.

335
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,100
I'm going to take off.

336
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,397
Guys, rules are good!

337
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,607
Rules help control the fun.
