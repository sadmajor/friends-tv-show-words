3
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:11,916
I would never do that.Mom, c'mon, stop worrying.

4
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:18,130
This is a safe street,this is a safe building, there's nothing

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:25,604

This is unbelievable Phoebs,how can you be married?

18
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,862
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know,he's just a friend and he's gay andhe's just from Canada andhe just needed a green card.

19
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:27,035
I can't believe you married Duncan.
I mean how could you not tell me?We lived together, we told each other everything.

20
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:31,903
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you,you'd get really, like, judgemental andyou would not approve.

21
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:38,862
Of course I wouldn't approve,I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who,hello, was gay. I mean,what the hell were you thinking?

22
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:42,100
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.

23
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,508
OK, I wasn't in love with him andI was just helping out a friend.

24
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:51,482
Please, when he left town you stayedin your pajamas for a month 
andI saw you eat a cheeseburger.

25
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:55,062
Huuh.

26
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:57,412
Well, didn't you?

27
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:59,461
I might have.

28
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:01,648
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

29
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,598
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.

30
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:05,306
What have I not told you?

31
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:14,107
Oh, I don't know. Umm,how about the fact that the underwear out thereon the telephone pole is yoursfrom when you were having sex with Fun Bobbyout on the terrace.

32
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:15,814
What!

33
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:21,470
Wait a minute, who told you?

34
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,559
You are dead meat.

35
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:26,356
I didn't know it was a big secret.

36
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:34,225
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know,kinda the same lines as, say,
oh I don't know, having a third nipple.

37
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:38,811
You have a third nipple?

38
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:43,331
You bitch.

39
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:45,382
Whip it out, whip it out.

40
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:49,446
C'mon, there's nothin' to see,
it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.

41
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:54,268
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?

42
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:59,052
I can't believe you. 
You told me it was a nubbin.

43
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:01,809
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

44
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:07,083
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word,
I thought that's what it was.
Let me see it again.

45
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,427
Yeah, show it. Show it.The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.

46
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:11,396
Joey was in a porno movie.

47
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:14,680
Huuh.

48
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,946
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.

49
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:20,503
You were in a porno?

50
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:23,671
Ahh, alright, alright, alright,I was young and I just wanted a job,

51
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:32,341
OK. But at the last minuteI couldn't go through with it
so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copierbut can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.

52
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:35,784
That is wild.

53
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:37,231
So what's it shaped like?

54
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:38,513
Yeah, is there a hair on it?

55
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:41,762
What happens if you flick it?

56
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,715
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?

57
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:57,168
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nippleopens the delivery entranceto the magical land of Narnia.

58
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:04,916
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple isactually a sign of virility.
You get the best huts andwomen dance naked around you.

59
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:09,625
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance,in the tri-state area?

60
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:15,010
You know, you are so amazing,is there anything you, you don't know?

61
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,981
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.

62
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:26,641
Look honey, I wanted you to hook upwith Ross as much as you did.
But he's with her now andyou're just gonna have to get over it.

63
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:35,712
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it.God, see I didn't know that's I had to do,I just have to get over it.

64
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:38,132
Woah.

65
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:39,021
Foxy lady.

66
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:40,232
Where you goin'?

67
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:46,820
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan,he's skating tonight at the Garden,
he's in the Capades.

68
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,139
The Ice Capades?

69
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:55,662
No, no the gravel capades.Yeah, the turns aren't as fast butwhen Snoopy falls. . . funny.

70
00:05:55,662 --> 00:06:00,003
I can't believe you're dressing up for him.
I mean, you're just,you're setting yourself up all over again.

71
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:07,473
OK, no. For your informationI'm going to see himso I can put all those feeling behind me.

72
00:06:07,473 --> 00:06:15,330
OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this isbecause I think it's nice to look nicefor your gay husband.

73
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:26,420
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk.
Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?

74
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:34,591
Oh I see, I see, 
because of the third nipple thing.Ha ha ha ha. . .

75
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:40,504
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.

76
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:41,723

Hey?

82
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:59,300
What?

83
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,002
Can I ask you somethin'?

84
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:02,823
Sure.

85
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:03,864
Naa.

86
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:04,999
What? C'mon, talk to me.

87
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:18,948
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationshipbefore ha, have, having the sex?

88
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:24,923
Why? Who's not having. . .
Are you and Julie not, are, are you and,are you and Julie not having sex?

89
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:28,920
Technically, huh, no.

90
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,968
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed.

91
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:38,920
Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy,makes it feel like school?

92
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:48,383
No, no, she's great and it's not likewe haven't done anything.
I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff,lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .

93
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:52,940
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.

94
00:07:52,940 --> 00:08:02,594
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you knowI've only been with one woman my whole life andshe turned out to be a lesbian.

95
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:13,925
So now I've got myself all psyched out,you know, and it's become, like this,
this thing and I. . .

96
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:17,943
Well, you just must think I'm weird.

97
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:23,477
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think,
I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?

98
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:24,809
What?

99
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:27,941
I think it's sexy.

100
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,349
Sexy?

101
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:38,824
Let me tell you something.
As a woman there is nothing sexier
than a man who does not want to have sex.

102
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:40,004
No kidding?

103
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:41,261
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?

104
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:41,955
What?

105
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,752
I'd wait.

106
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:45,821
You'd wait?

107
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:54,622
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . .
then I'd wait some more.

108
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:56,103
Really?

109
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:03,711
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tellsyou she wants it, I don't care if begs,she pleads, she tells you she,she's gonna have sex with, with another man.

110
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:08,766
That just means it's working.

111
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:11,098
Women really want this?

112
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:19,632
More than jewelry.

113
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,207
Hi.

114
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:31,276

138
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:53,507
But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.

139
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:54,270

150
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:50,587
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.

151
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,951
What's wrong with people having sex?

152
00:11:52,951 --> 00:12:04,504
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensiveand uh, degrading to women and females.

153
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:10,308
And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering.

154
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:15,087
And, Monica help me out here.

155
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:22,044
Hell, I wanna see Joey.

156
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:27,466
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.

157
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:32,662
OK, now wait a minute.
That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.

158
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:35,222
All I say is, she better get the job.

159
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:39,660
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.

160
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:48,907
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come.See I'm comin' to fix the copier,I can't get to the copier,I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . .

161
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:54,514
so I just watch 'em have sex.

162
00:12:54,514 --> 00:13:01,222
And then I say, wait, here's my line,you know that's bad for the paper tray.

163
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:02,434
Nice work my friend.

164
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:07,645
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again.Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me.

165
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:12,569
There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .

166
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,599
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.

167
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:29,275
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.

168
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:33,979
Ohh. . .K. How come?

169
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,379
Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.

170
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,860
What?

171
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,905
Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this.

172
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,622
I'm straight.

173
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:46,249
Huuh.

174
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,632
Yeah, I know, I.

175
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:57,702
I, I don't, I don't understand,how can you be straight?
I mean, you're,you're so smart and funny andyou throw such great Academy Award parties.

176
00:13:57,702 --> 00:14:04,700
I know, that's what I kept telling myselfbut you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.

177
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,387
So how long have you known?

178
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:12,410
Well I guess on some level I always knewI was straight.

179
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:21,033
I though I was supposed to be something else,you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay,I was just tryin' to fit in.

180
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:26,041
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?

181
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:30,243
Her name's Debra.

182
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:35,065
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?

183
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:42,224
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times,back in college,

184
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:46,828
when I'd get really drunk,go to a straight bar and wake upwith a woman next to me.

185
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:53,022
But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.

186
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:54,020
Sure.

187
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:01,724
But now I know I don't have a choice about this,I was born this way.

188
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:02,915
I, I don't know what to say.

189
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:16,189
I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years andyou think you know him and then one day says,'Oh, I'm not gay.'

190
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:19,622
I'm, I'm still me.

191
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:25,471
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?

192
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:30,329
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.

193
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:34,156
That saves us a conversation.

194
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:36,990
Well, listen, this has been greatbut I'm officially wiped.

195
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,584
Me too, we should get goin'.

196
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:45,509
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys,I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty.

197
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:49,868
Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.

198
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:53,555
Rachel, that's all we do.

199
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:57,795
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?

200
00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:59,763
What about Julie?

201
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:06,006
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now andwe don't really know you.

202
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,757
I mean, who is Julie?

203
00:16:08,757 --> 00:16:14,041
I mean, what do you like, what don't you like?
We wanna know everything.

204
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,979
Well, that could take a while.

205
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:22,101
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?

206
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,731
I got the time to get to know Julie.

207
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:25,326
I got time.

208
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:30,632
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go?

209
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:32,511
That's fine.

210
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,340
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood,what was that like?

211
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,440
Well, in a nutshell. . .

212
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,540
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.

213
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,840
So, um, have you told your parents?

214
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:52,502
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool,my brother's straight so. . .

215
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:53,918
Here you go.

216
00:16:53,918 --> 00:17:05,716
You know what,I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this outsooner and um, I had been around,do you think that I would have been the one who. . .

217
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:13,196
no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me,I don't think either answer would make me feel better.

218
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:29,298
I love you Phoebe.

219
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,279
So your brother's straigh huh?

220
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,487
Seriously.

221
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:40,931
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas,

222
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:44,561
and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.

223
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,043
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?

224
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:50,451
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.

225
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:54,071
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?

226
00:17:54,071 --> 00:18:02,108
I'm goin' home.
What?

227
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:04,380
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?

228
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,820
Goodnight.

229
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,300
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .

230
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,002
Oh, no no, I am.

231
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:17,698
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?

232
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:22,837
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.

233
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:30,811
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what,how are you gonna handle it. I mean,are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand,are you just gonna pounce?

234
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:36,307
I uh, I don't know,I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.

235
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:39,104
OK, gook luck.

236
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:42,649
Wha, uhh, what?

237
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:44,965
Nothing, I mean, um,

238
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:55,912
it is your first time with her and,you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's,that's pretty darn hard to recover from.

239
00:18:55,912 --> 00:19:00,921
OK, now I'm nervous.

240
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:02,028
Maybe you should put it off.

241
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:06,880
No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just,

242
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:16,827
God I just,I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know,and now, now I'm actually happy.

243
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:26,342
You know, I mean, really happy.
I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.

244
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:31,841
I know, yeah, sorry.

245
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:34,338
What, it's not your fault.

246
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:40,426
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.

247
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:48,158
I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole,you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.

248
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:49,527
Really?

249
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,228
Yeah, I mean, you know it,

250
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:56,470
I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to,I don't know, like

251
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,222
catch me off guard, you know, with like a really

252
00:19:59,222 --> 00:20:08,305
good kiss, you know really,sort of um, soft at first,

253
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:13,465
then maybe um brush the hair away from my face,

254
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:17,430
and look far into my eyes

255
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,207
in a way that let's me knowthat something

256
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:23,989
amazing is about to happen.

257
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:30,188
Uh-huh.

258
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:38,525
And then, I don't know,I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that,so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you.

259
00:20:38,525 --> 00:21:01,462
And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.

260
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:05,983
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.

261
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:12,837
Ohh, God.

262
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:26,929
Good morning.

263
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:34,228
Well, somebody got some last night.

264
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:40,228
Twice.
