270
00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:05,095
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far.

271
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:12,892
Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys.

272
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:20,782
Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel.

273
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:25,461
She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back,

274
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:29,616
but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman.

275
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:34,289
Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us.

276
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,091
So, how've you been?

277
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:33,865
Oh my god. Oh my god.

278
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:44,459
Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!

279
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:46,108
Rache!

280
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:48,867
Oh, there you are!

281
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:56,210
Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?

282
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,575
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?

283
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:00,328
What?

284
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,211
You're bleeding.

285
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:10,941
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. I wanna hear everything!

286
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:13,615
Well, where do I start?

287
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:17,733
Um... This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.

288
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,890
Hi

289
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,827
Oh... These are, these aren't for you.

290
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:32,696
These are for you. Welcome to our country.

291
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:37,221
Thank you. I'm from New York.

292
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:46,737
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.

293
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:52,178
No way!

294
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:56,219
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!

295
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:05,661
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?

296
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,021
Um, this?

297
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,052
Yes.

298
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:10,575
Guys, you got your hair cut.

299
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:14,493
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.

300
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:23,059
Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.

301
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:33,775
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.

302
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:39,090
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.

303
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,986
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!

304
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:50,177
That's all right, Rache, we got the bags.

305
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:52,891
Hi, hello.

306
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:58,333
Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?

307
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,941
What up?!

308
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,824
Everyone, this is Julie.

309
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:03,783
Julie.

310
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:07,094
Ohh.

311
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:09,466
Hi!

312
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:15,302
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.

313
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:16,465
And bus.

314
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,727
Oh my god.

315
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:18,668
The screaming guy?

316
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:19,850
And the spitting?

317
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,618
You gotta hear this story.

318
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:24,251
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...

319
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:25,740
200 years at least.
- ...and this guy--

320
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:34,128
And the chicken poops in her lap.

321
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:38,330
Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

322
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:46,741
Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.

323
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:51,251
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?

324
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:52,541
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.

325
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:57,973
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.

326
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:00,571
Julie!

327
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:02,579
Julie, isn't that great?

328
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:08,851
I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

329
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,332
It's an expression.

330
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:15,458
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.

331
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,850
And then we've gotta get some sleep.

332
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,975
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.

333
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:27,062
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.

334
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:31,334
Bye.

335
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:39,852
Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee?

336
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:40,732
Yeah, sure.

337
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:41,618
Thank you.

338
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:42,530
Hey, Rache, can I get--
- Did you talk to him?

339
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,262
No.
- Then, no.

340
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:59,422
So what the hell happened to you in China?

341
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:02,817
I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.

342
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:11,968
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?

343
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:14,368
God?

344
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:16,740
It was you, pal.

345
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,053
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.

346
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:24,406
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all.

347
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:28,509
But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time.

348
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:34,026
And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.

349
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,972
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

350
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:38,335
Here's your lemonade.

351
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,819
I didn't order lemonade.

352
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:43,991
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.

353
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:48,892
But--
- Go go go go, come on!

354
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,979
So then, well, what did you find out?

355
00:06:51,979 --> 00:07:02,297
He said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry.

356
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:08,290
But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself

357
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,978
without any outside help whatsoever.

358
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:14,487
How is that the silver lining?

359
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:16,938
You have to really wanna see it.

360
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:26,219
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.

361
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:28,891
Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking?

362
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:34,327
Oh, ok.

363
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:42,363
How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?

364
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:47,165
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.

365
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,046
All right, so what were you thinking?

366
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:53,129
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?

367
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,206
Ohh! No.

368
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:57,499
Why not?

369
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:02,661
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.

370
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:04,326
No you're not.

371
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:09,189
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.

372
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:16,051
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.

373
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,786
Hello? Hi.

374
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:23,511
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?

375
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:24,972
Needs some clothes altered?

376
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:29,011
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.

377
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:30,542
Why don't you go see Frankie?

378
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:34,169
My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15.

379
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:45,253
No wait, 16. No, excuse me, 15. When was 1990?

380
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:51,452
Ok. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!

381
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:02,493
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What?

382
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:06,899
Oh, that is so sweet.

383
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:18,770
No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.

384
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:25,990
Well you didn't hang up either.
- She didn't hang up either!

385
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:32,026
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y--

386
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:44,051
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.

387
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:48,821
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
- Okay!

388
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,664
I'm sorry, we got disconnected...

389
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,072
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me?

390
00:09:55,072 --> 00:10:00,737
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy.

391
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:09,330
Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.

392
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,410
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

393
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,730
I know you did.

394
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,262
I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it.

395
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:24,819
I gotta get out of here.

396
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:29,300
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.

397
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:38,050
You know, I think I was sixteen.

398
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,902
Please, just a little bit off the back.

399
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:44,586
I'm still on "no".

400
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:48,505
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?

401
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:53,751
No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again.

402
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:54,930
What's goin' on?

403
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,369
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.

404
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:59,611
What stupid thing did you do?

405
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:02,134
Bon giorno tutti!

406
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:15,770
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.

407
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,745
Rachel, how did this happen?

408
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,864
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.

409
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:23,930
Where?
 -At his apartment. Is this juice?

410
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,369
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?

411
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:31,008
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.

412
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:34,071
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.

413
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:36,173
People do stupid things when they're upset.

414
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:42,816
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't

415
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:45,645
but this is about your horrible mistake.

416
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:50,532
Hi.

417
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:52,703
Sorry we're late but we were--

418
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,687
well, there was touching.

419
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:00,697
Hey, hey Ross.

420
00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:07,626
Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?

421
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,447
I do Raquel.

422
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:17,467
So, uh, he's back.

423
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:20,049
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?

424
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,935
No, not a problem.

425
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:24,011
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.

426
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,487
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.

427
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:34,936
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension,

428
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,572
I've got pants that need to be altered.

429
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:43,463
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.

430
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:48,011
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?

431
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:52,330
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.

432
00:12:52,330 --> 00:13:02,332
All right. Ok, but, but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.

433
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:03,651
I promise.

434
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:10,452
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't.

435
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:14,710
But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.

436
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:27,529
All right, that's it, I quit.

437
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,370
What? I didn't say anything.

438
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,029
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok.

439
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:38,972
This is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.

440
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:44,665
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.

441
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:51,449
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.

442
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,871
How? who wears it?

443
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:55,973
Demi Moore.

444
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:58,025
Demi Moore is not a he.

445
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:02,619
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.

446
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:07,376
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.

447
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:12,051
Oh, oh, oh my god!

448
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,135
Oh my god!

449
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:17,108
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?

450
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:22,018
She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.

451
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:23,451
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.

452
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:27,131
I KNOW!

453
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,249
How long do you want the cuffs?

454
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,966
At least as long as I have the pants.

455
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:49,768
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.

456
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,291
How is she?

457
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:08,969
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.

458
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:10,567
How's the hair?

459
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:15,373
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good.

460
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:20,050
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.

461
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,708
Can we see her?

462
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,902
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her.

463
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:29,141
Ross, you come on in.

464
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:36,409
How're you doing?
 -I'm ok.

465
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:48,529
Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.

466
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:56,063
Oh, Joey. When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom.

467
00:15:56,063 --> 00:16:04,136
But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me.

468
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:06,151
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.

469
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:09,207
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?

470
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:16,107
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.

471
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:17,587
I don't know, I don't know.

472
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:21,779
Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women.

473
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,391
In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women.

474
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:32,807
The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.

475
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:45,173
Yo, paisan!

476
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:50,217
Can I talk to you for a sec?

477
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:56,254
Your tailor is a very bad man!

478
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:58,019
Frankie? What're you talking about?

479
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,307
Hey, what's goin' on?

480
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:12,180
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.

481
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,409
What?

482
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:16,730
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.

483
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,489
Come on. He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite--

484
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:24,369
what?

485
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:28,770
Cupping.

486
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,893
That's how they do pants!

487
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:42,137
First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.

488
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:45,491
What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?

489
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:54,168
Yes, yes it is. In prison!

490
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:56,247
What's the matter with you?

491
00:17:56,247 --> 00:18:00,691
What?

492
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:07,529
That's not?

493
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,577
Oh my god.

494
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:21,021
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.

495
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:27,414
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.

496
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:30,542
Thank you. My hair is very amused.

497
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:38,378
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City.

498
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:42,937
I know it's crazy, but it's true.

499
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:45,091
Thank you.

500
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,972
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

501
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:48,731
Bye, Rache.

502
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:49,870
Wait, are you leaving?

503
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,647
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"

504
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:54,867
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?

505
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,936
Okay.

506
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,790
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...

507
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,867
That's ok.

508
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,461
What's goin' on?

509
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:23,899
Well, Ok. First of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't.

510
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:30,173
Um, second of all, what?

511
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:35,829
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy,

512
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:41,377
and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?

513
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:44,591
No. No-no-no-no.

514
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:48,144
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum.

515
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:52,287
I hate him. I mean I physically hate him.

516
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:58,332
You know I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.

517
00:19:58,332 --> 00:19:59,865
Really?

518
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:11,385
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know?

519
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:18,216
Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel".

520
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:28,671
You know, someone who makes you feel good, like the way I am with Julie.

521
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:33,261
Was there a second of all?

522
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:44,611
Oh. No, I think that was the whole all.

523
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:54,969
No, I swear to god, Dad.

524
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:58,222
That's not how they measure pants.

525
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:07,941
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andy McDowell's new haircut?

526
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:10,430
Oh yeah, I think I do that.
- Really?

527
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,459
Yeah. You wanna do it right now?

528
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:16,824
Great!

529
00:21:16,824 --> 00:21:20,088
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time.

530
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:25,009
Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

531
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,127
No.

532
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:32,617
No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell.

533
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:36,451
Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.

534
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:38,941
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.

535
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:41,962
You're welcome.
