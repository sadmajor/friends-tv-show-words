00:00:02,312 --> 00:00:04,081
'Previously on friends'

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:06,165
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this,

3
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:09,605
He's right here in New York filming "Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan."

4
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:13,266
Hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel.

5
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:20,876
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...

6
00:00:20,876 --> 00:00:23,892
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.

7
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:37,679
- Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
- Woah, dude, burn.

8
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,190
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,832
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.

10
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:52,071
- Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
- In human terms,  I'd say

11
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:53,428
- Cybill Shepard.
- Woah.

12
00:00:56,951 --> 00:01:00,275
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.

13
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,506
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?

14
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:09,545
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?

15
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:11,746
The one in the director's chair.

16
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:14,331
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.

17
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:17,768
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?

18
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:21,481
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away

19
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:26,585
from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me.

20
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:30,570
Is he lookin', is he lookin'?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
F r i e n d s
Season 213.The One After the Superbowl II

22
00:02:21,278 --> 00:02:23,957
- We've got a problem.
- Tell me.

23
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:28,050
I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.

24
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,312
- Is it bad?
- It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down.

25
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:36,944
Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.

26
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:39,155
I'll talk to her.

27
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:40,426
I hate actors.

28
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,625
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.

29
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:49,764
- Excuse me.
- Ahhhh.

30
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:54,026
Uh, is your name Chandler?

31
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:55,796
Uh, yes, yes it is.

32
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:57,236
Chandler Bing?

33
00:02:57,236 --> 00:03:00,572
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?

34
00:03:00,572 --> 00:03:05,116
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses,

35
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:07,916
I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.

36
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:15,917
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.

37
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:20,195
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.

38
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:23,237
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.

39
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:26,354
Remember the class play?

40
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:30,409
You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.

41
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:37,953
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.

42
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:45,674
- Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
- What what what what?

43
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:47,045
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

44
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:50,290
I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.

45
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,032
Ya think?

46
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:56,593
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?

47
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:57,951
No, was he any good in it?

48
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:01,317
- Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
- Wow.

49
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:04,089
So why don't you go talk to him?

50
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,438
Oh, yeah.

51
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,685
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?

52
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:11,556
He could hear me.

53
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:12,786
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.

54
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,729
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't.

55
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,590
Tell him I cook.

56
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,715
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

57
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:25,807
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm,

58
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:33,188
my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.

59
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:36,632
You don't think I'm cute?

60
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:40,655
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute?

61
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:49,074
OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute.

62
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:50,156
So what should I tell her?

63
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:55,893
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.

64
00:05:02,764 --> 00:05:06,758
- Makeup.
- Oh that's me, I gotta go.

65
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:08,370
Oh uh, o, OK.

66
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,833
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.

67
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,883
Well, uh, let's try one more. . .

68
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:20,997
there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.

69
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:27,881
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.

70
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:35,880
No one was around to hear that?

71
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:41,672
So what'd he say?

72
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:47,796
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out.

73
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:52,154
I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.

74
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:56,277
Well, thanks anyway.

75
00:05:56,277 --> 00:06:00,588
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.

76
00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:04,278
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can.

77
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:06,671
Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...

78
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:10,169
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight.

79
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:13,591
Thank you.

80
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:25,770
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.

81
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,207
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . .

82
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,587
no guys around, huh.

83
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,046
Does anybody need anything?

84
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:39,987
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it.

85
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:42,671
If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.

86
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:46,985
That is so unfair.

87
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:51,744
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.

88
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:55,874
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight,

89
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:59,030
that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.

90
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,953
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?

91
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,718
- Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
- Yeah,

92
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:06,360
unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.

93
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:10,763
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.

94
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:14,160
Stick a fork what?

95
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,075
Like, when you're cooking a steak.

96
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:18,036
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.

97
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:21,715
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?

98
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:25,522
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.

99
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:27,530
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.

100
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,680
- I've met the perfect woman.
- What?

101
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,556
OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says,

102
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,718
'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'

103
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:44,997
- What did you say?
- Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'.

104
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:49,314
I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?

105
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:51,553
Oh, you just know.

106
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,633
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.

107
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,367
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see,

108
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:07,356
what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.

109
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:11,553
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.

110
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:14,912
But um, here's an idea,

111
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:19,647
have you ever worn women's underwear?

112
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,474
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's,

113
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:28,238
and there were three of us in there.

114
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:35,390
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.

115
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:43,068
You want me to wear your panties?

116
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:44,550
Could ya?

117
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,365
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . .

118
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,510
You're swell.

119
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:02,666
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.

120
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,765
- Oooh.
- With mealworms.

121
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:09,963
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles.

122
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:13,191
What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?

123
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:22,810
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh.

124
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:31,150
No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work.

125
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:37,633
No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned.

126
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:41,308
Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.

127
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:50,321
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.

128
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:58,307
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-.

129
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:04,892
Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?

130
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,161
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...

131
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:10,356
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.

132
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,241
That is the most ridiculous.

133
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:14,010
- You sold me out.
- I did not sell you out.

134
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,826
- Yes you did. Absolutely.
- Would you let me talk.

135
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:22,552
Did you just flick me?

136
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:26,277
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus-

137
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,966
Ow. That hurt.

138
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,433
Quit flicking.

139
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:34,712
- Ow, you stop flicking.
- You flicked me first.

140
00:10:55,411 --> 00:11:00,235
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.

141
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:06,430
Ow. Ow. Ow.

142
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,885
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.

143
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:12,244
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?

144
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:13,549
Uh-huh.

145
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:17,670
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?

146
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,193
OK.

147
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,604
Oh that's what you want.

148
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:24,146
Yes.

149
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:26,852
- Fine.
- Fine,

150
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:34,188
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.

151
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,906
- Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
- Forget about it.

152
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:49,005
How you doin there squirmy?

153
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,082
I'm hangin in. . .

154
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:53,197
and a little out.

155
00:11:56,562 --> 00:12:02,311
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.

156
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:05,593
- I have nothing to do with casting.
- So what're you guys gonna eat?

157
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:15,040
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?

158
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:21,594
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.

159
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,129
I want you right here, right now.

160
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:33,610
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa.

161
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:38,914
They do have the shrimp.

162
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:42,870
Meet me in the bathroom.

163
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:50,622
I'm going to the bathroom now.

164
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:00,651
C'mon.

165
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:07,118
Alright mister, let's see those panties.

166
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:08,625
Alrighty.

167
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:15,280
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?

168
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,037
What?

169
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:19,870
- If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
- Oh.

170
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:28,914
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.

171
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:33,995
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.

172
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,357
C'mon hurry, hurry.

173
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:39,727
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?

174
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:44,517
- Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
- OK.

175
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:48,872
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.

176
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:52,312
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-...

177
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:56,012
Susie?

178
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:57,239
Susie.

179
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,768
This is for the fourth grade.

180
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:04,235
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?

181
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:06,951
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean?

182
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:10,030
I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.

183
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,627
What, what's what you mean?

184
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:15,917
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing.

185
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:19,153
I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.

186
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,829
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?

187
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:29,009
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.

188
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:37,865
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.

189
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:55,203
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

190
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,551
Can you beat up that guy?

191
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,410
- Can you beat up that guy?
- Sure.

192
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,870
This is so wild. Ya know,

193
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,750
I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.

194
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,193
Normally, I would not do it.

195
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:14,830
Well, what made you make the exception for me?

196
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,988
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore.

197
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:23,806
By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...

198
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:26,914
- Say you're sorry.
- No.

199
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:34,042
- Say it.
- No.

200
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:37,903
Rachel, you say you're sorry

201
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,247
or your sweater gets it.

202
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:43,546
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.

203
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:47,916
Say you're sorry.

204
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:52,111
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.

205
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,883
What're you gonna do?

206
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:02,395
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.

207
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,964
You don't have the guts.

208
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:12,123
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.

209
00:16:20,157 --> 00:16:23,212
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS.

210
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:28,392
This is crazy.

211
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:31,792
Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?

212
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:37,768
Yes that's right.

213
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:43,437
But still, I-, look at your purse,

214
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,231
look at your sweater,

215
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,476
look at yourselves.

216
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:53,788
I'll help you fix your sweater.

217
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:59,364
I'll help you throw out your purse.

218
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:01,873
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.

219
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,868
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.

220
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,427
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

221
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:34,587
- Joey?
- Ma?

222
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,410
Joey!

223
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:40,322
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.

224
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:42,965
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.

225
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:47,543
- Are you naked in there?
- Not exactly. . .

226
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:51,917
I'm wearin panties.

227
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:56,172
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?

228
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,995
No, no, this is the first time.

229
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,796
Wow, talk about your bad luck,

230
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:09,357
I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.

231
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:14,636
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.

232
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:17,042
- Well, let me see.
- No.

233
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,163
I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.

234
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:21,291
Alright, alright.

235
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:27,916
Woah, someone's flossing.

236
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:35,990
Joey, some people don't like that.

237
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:40,877
- Chandler's wearing panties.
- What?

238
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:43,547
- Let me see.
- No, no, you don't have to see.

239
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,590
Hi Tushie.

240
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:50,520
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.

241
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,771
No?

242
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,950
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.

243
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,705
How can you not be wearing any underwear?

244
00:18:57,705 --> 00:19:00,866
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.

245
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:05,447
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.

246
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:08,232
Hi.

247
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,572
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?

248
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,914
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.

249
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:43,351
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.

250
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:44,727
What happened?

251
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:48,270
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me

252
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,409
and boom, I'm dying on the gurney.

253
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:57,752
Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.

254
00:19:57,752 --> 00:20:03,726
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff.

255
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:07,066
But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.

256
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:13,359
- Oh my God.
- What?

257
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,475
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.

258
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:00,555
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

259
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:07,274
Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken.
 Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

260
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:08,513
How long you been waitin' to say that?

261
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:10,048
About 20 minutes.

262
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:18,720
- Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
- Aaaaagggghhhhh.

263
00:21:20,835 --> 00:21:22,519
Cut.

264
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:25,240
- Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
- Aaaaagggghhhhh.

265
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:29,276
Cut.

266
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,636
- Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
- Aaaaagggghhhhh.

267
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:36,515
- Mommy
- Cut.

268
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:41,366
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
