1
00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:07,072
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?

2
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:12,084
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and,

3
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:18,025
well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.

4
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:21,398
Ok honey, you really need a job.

5
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:23,951
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.

6
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:24,628
Really.

7
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:29,128
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.

8
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:32,510
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.

9
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,106
No, 'cause you just said dad

10
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:39,006
and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father.

11
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:43,811
Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...

12
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:47,634
- which is my father's last name.
- Ahh.

13
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:52,240
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,027
Yes!!

15
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:57,570
And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,030
His indian name?

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,043
No because I chickened out the last time

18
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:08,241
when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.

19
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:11,273
- Freakish. 
- Wow.
- Freaky. 
- Weird, weird.

20
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:12,987
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?

21
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:15,550
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,401
Why?

23
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,550
Hamburger. McDonald's.

24
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,234
Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.

25
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:32,234
F r i e n d s
Season 221. The One With the Two Bullies

26
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:13,987
- Man, I am so beat.
- Oh yeah.

27
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:18,467
- Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
- Yeah alright.

28
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,506
Hey you're in our seats.

29
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:23,808
Oh, sorry we didn't know.

30
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:25,759
Hey, we were sitting there.

31
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,517
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?

32
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,161
Is that supposed to be funny?

33
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:36,325
No actually, I was just going for colorful.

34
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:38,605
- What's with this guy?
- What's with you?

35
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:42,918
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.

36
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:51,714
What just happened?

37
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:58,312
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.

38
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,444
That, that is funny.

39
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:05,547
- Can I have it back?
- No.

40
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:07,252
- No?
- No.

41
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:10,641
Ok, ok, you know what?

42
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:18,209
I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke.

43
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,648
But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.

44
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:23,667
Why should we?

45
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,609
Because it's a special hat.

46
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:34,271
See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...

47
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:41,105
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?

48
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:44,987
- You got a problem with that?
- No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.

49
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,663
Hey, how'd the interview go?

50
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,038
It bit.

51
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:56,872
It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter.

52
00:03:56,872 --> 00:04:00,389
I mean I was a chef at 'Cafe des Artistes'.

53
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,013
I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?

54
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:05,963
So don't do it.

55
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:08,849
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.

56
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,802
Monica, relax, go get a beer.

57
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:13,349
I don't want a beer.

58
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,842
Who said it was for you?

59
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:23,116
Hhhiiii.

60
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:24,707
What's the matter with you?

61
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:27,552
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.

62
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:29,634
- Noo.
- You're kiddin'.

63
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:35,102
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know.

64
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:37,517
- We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
- Oohhh. Hi. 
- Hi.

65
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,907
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.

66
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:49,647
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.

67
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:54,010
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.

68
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:58,152
- Hey, I went up.
- What?

69
00:04:58,152 --> 00:05:01,314
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points.

70
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:07,424
Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...

71
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:10,479
a lot more than that today.

72
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,143
Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.

73
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:13,829
Do what?

74
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,403
Put all my money in me.

75
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:18,147
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.

76
00:05:18,147 --> 00:05:21,390
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls...

77
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,401
Yes Manhattan...

78
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:28,994
yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.

79
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:41,312
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?

80
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:45,609
Oh God, here we go.

81
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:49,555
For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.

82
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:51,624
- We love you, we're here for you.
- Yeah good luck, good luck.

83
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:53,503
Thanks.

84
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,957
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?

85
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:00,643
Ohh, what is in that?

86
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:02,821
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.

87
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,207
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.

88
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:09,410
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.

89
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,804
Run Phoebe run.

90
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:16,115
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.

91
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:17,502
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?

92
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,873
Are you kidding me?

93
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:21,188
Look kibbles, bits.

94
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:26,486
Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap.

95
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:33,930
Ok, alright, we have a problem.

96
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,040
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,767
Ok, here, I know what we can do.

98
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,945
Hey, hey, hey no.

99
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:44,400
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich,

101
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,547
Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?

102
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,909
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.

103
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,488
Are you crazy?

104
00:06:57,488 --> 00:07:01,067
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.

105
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:08,590
- Hey.
- What?

106
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,833
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?

107
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,227
Do you say this stuff to girls?

108
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:27,668
- Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
- And look where they're sitting.

109
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:33,189
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.

110
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,510
- Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
- Yeah.

111
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,442
This couch belongs to us.

112
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:39,792
Alright, I'll tell you what,

113
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:48,876
you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.

114
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:52,716
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.

115
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:54,749
Alright, that's it.

116
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:59,189
I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther,

117
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:02,948
these guys are trying to take our seat.

118
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:05,421
Fellas, these guys were here first.

119
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:07,506
- Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
- Sorry.

120
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:11,486
- There you go.
- Thank you Gunther.

121
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:16,689
We didn't want to have to go and do that.

122
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:20,390
- He told on us?
- You told on us?

123
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,105
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.

124
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,229
- Don't play with his things.
- I know.

125
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:35,191
Alright, let's take this outside.

126
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:40,686
Let's, let's take this outside?

127
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,281
Who talks like that?

128
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:47,465
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.

129
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:50,383
- You had to ask.
- Yeah.

130
00:08:52,584 --> 00:09:00,323
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.

131
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:02,531
Well then here's the deal,

132
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:11,313
you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.

133
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:14,514
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.

134
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,791
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.

135
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:26,119
Yeah, I don't know.

136
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,241
What's the matter?

137
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:34,426
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know.

138
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:39,668
It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know,

139
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:39,639
but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever,

140
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:45,686
despite what she says.

141
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:51,646
And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.

142
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:56,951
I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.

143
00:09:56,951 --> 00:10:02,250
- Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
- Yeah, whatever you need.

144
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,821
Hey, you wanna go home?

145
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:06,907
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again

146
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,871
What was that?

147
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:33,628
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

148
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:42,393
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend.

149
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:45,431
Thank you. Wooo.

150
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:47,044
Time is money my friend?

151
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:54,166
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'

152
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,791
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?

153
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:02,311
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.

154
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:06,392
- How did you make $17.
- Well, my financially challenged friends,

155
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:10,411
I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.

156
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:12,160
How come those?

157
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,154
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada.

158
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:21,463
And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.

159
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:23,708
What happened to uh, MEG.?

160
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,510
MEG was good for me but I dumped her.

161
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,526
Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.

162
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:34,433
That is so not my motto.

163
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:38,924
Hey.

164
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:40,844
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?

165
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:44,550
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate.

166
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,213
Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.

167
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:49,750
- Good.
- Oh, thank God.

168
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,836
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches

169
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:57,191
and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...

170
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:00,364
still hoping.

171
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:06,552
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?

172
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:10,972
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say,

173
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:16,180
like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'

174
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,442
- Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
- Ok.

175
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:24,071
Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.

176
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:27,269
DON'T...

177
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,040
be too long with the phone.

178
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:34,651
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.

179
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:37,323
It's a woman.

180
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,994
So talk to her.

181
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:47,997
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is.

182
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:54,546
I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours.

183
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:56,165
Uh, goodbye.

184
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,268
- Why the voice.
- Hard to say.

185
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,951
- Your cappucino sir.
- Thank you.

186
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,844
- Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
- Absolutely.

187
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,786
How come it's not mixing with the water?

188
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:31,805
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving.

189
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:35,345
Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.

190
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:41,673
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what.

191
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:45,904
After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you

192
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:50,483
and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.

193
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,315
Ok.

194
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:54,049
No.

195
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,427
No?

196
00:13:55,427 --> 00:14:00,032
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee.

197
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:03,865
Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'.

198
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:07,285
I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.

199
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:10,405
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.

200
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,429
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?

201
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:14,750
Yeah, sure.

202
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,368
- By someone besides Monica?
- No.

203
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:20,907
So what. So what if we get beaten up,

204
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:26,652
maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life.Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.

205
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:29,424
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again?

206
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:33,997
Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.

207
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,185
- I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
- What?

208
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:39,919
Hi, welcome home.

209
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,273
- I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
- For what?

210
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:43,661
- I've gotta get back in the game.
- Why, when did you get out of the game?

211
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:47,252
- I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
- Oh no.

212
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:50,035
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.

213
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:52,868
Ok.

214
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:56,608
Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.

215
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,831
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?

216
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,271
- I, I don't have it.
- But I need it.

217
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,446
Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job.

218
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:10,789
You know, with the dancing and the costumes.

219
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:15,730
I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.

220
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,392
Nobody does honey.

221
00:15:21,227 --> 00:15:22,070
Hi.

222
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,963
Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?

223
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:32,481
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose.

224
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,469
She's a vegetarian.

225
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,586
What are these, stitches?

226
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:41,066
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him.

227
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:46,837
You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.

228
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:49,523
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.

229
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:51,688
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.

230
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:52,766
How do you know Frank?

231
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:56,524
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?

232
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:58,168
Yeah.

233
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,263
Frank.

234
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:01,170
Yeah.

235
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,313
What?

236
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:05,991
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.

237
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:09,429
- He went out for groceries.
- Ok so will he be back soon?

238
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:13,729
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.

239
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:20,042
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.

240
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:27,930
Hey lady. Hey wait up.

241
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,236
How do you know my dad?

242
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:34,885
Um well I don't really. Just genetically.

243
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:37,651
He's kinda my dad too.

244
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:40,799
- Heavy.
- Yeah.

245
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,392
So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?

246
00:16:44,392 --> 00:16:47,232
No but he didn't really talk about anything.

247
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:49,108
Oh.

248
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,742
Except stilts.

249
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:52,487
Stilts?

250
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:54,263
Yeah, he loved stilts.

251
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:59,659
One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh,

252
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:05,391
all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window.

253
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,191
He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving

254
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:15,840
- 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
- Wow. 
- Yeah.

255
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,979
- I don't know what to do with that.
- Me neither.

256
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:24,840
So you're like my big sister.

257
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,932
Yeah.

258
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:29,726
This is huge, you can buy me beer.

259
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:31,908
I'm not gonna.

260
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:36,007
But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say,

261
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,921
'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'

262
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:42,391
- I gotta friend named Mark.
- That'll work too.

263
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:45,189
Cool, alright.

264
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:50,256
So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.

265
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:51,866
Yeah, that'd be ok.

266
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:52,762
Alright.

267
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:56,207
- Ok, I'm in the book.
- Ok, yeah. 
- Alright.

268
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:01,348
So um, stilts huh?

269
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:05,667
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.

270
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,512
Ok.

271
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:15,466
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground.

272
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:20,360
- How long does a cup of coffee take?
- Would you come on! Come on!

273
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,146
Thank you.

274
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:37,162
- Ah, there we go.
- I think we proved our point.

275
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:40,199
- You burn your mouth?
- Cannot feel my tounge.

276
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,433
Bullies, big bullies.

277
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:50,714
Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.

278
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,639
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.

279
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,345
Yes, and that's why we're here.

280
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:57,880
Yes, we're standing out ground...

281
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,247
apparently.

282
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:00,923
Let's do this alright.

283
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,917
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?

284
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:06,707
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.

285
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:09,306
- Alright, let's do this.
- Alright.

286
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:14,405
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

287
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:15,316
Whad'ya mean?

288
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:19,968
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.

289
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:23,411
- No, you can't use your watch.
- Ok.

290
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:26,226
- Or your keys.
- Ok.

291
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:32,312
Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there.

292
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:36,585
Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.

293
00:19:36,865 --> 00:19:40,167
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

294
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,036
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?

295
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:46,151
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.

296
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:53,388
Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.

297
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:56,385
Ok, nothing from the neck up.

298
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:59,752
Or the waist down.

299
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:01,670
- Dana's ovulating.
- Oh really, you guys tryin' again?

300
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,024
Yeah.

301
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:06,723
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?

302
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:08,198
C'MON!

303
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:12,594
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
