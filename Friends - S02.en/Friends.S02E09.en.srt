1
00:00:03,951 --> 00:00:08,720
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly
Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,748
Oh my God, you should see
the size of his Christmas Balls.

3
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:15,995
Hey. 
Hey. 
Hey.

4
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,945
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?

5
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:21,364
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you
guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.

6
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:24,350
Oh, actually this year we just
made him homemade cookies.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,259
And twenty-five it is.

8
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:28,544
You gave him cookies?

9
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:30,477
Money is so impersonal.

10
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:33,840
Cookies says someone really cares...

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,402
Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.

12
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:41,283
I can see that. A plate of brownies
once told me a limerick.

13
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:47,432
Phoebs, let me ask you something,
were, were these, uh, funny brownies?

14
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:49,515
Not especially.

15
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:52,355
But you know what, I think they had pot in them.

16
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:57,431
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?

17
00:00:57,431 --> 00:01:00,906
Uhh, the mailman, the super.

18
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:03,029
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.

19
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:05,868
Oh my God.

20
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:07,106
What?

21
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:10,834
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.

22
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:15,910
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies
smashed in the sports section.

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,746
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.

24
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:25,829
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin
musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,071
I can't believe it's Christmas already.

26
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:19,286
Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin'
turkey, the next thing ya know,

27
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:23,846
your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.

28
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:27,746
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,525
Hey guys. 
Hey.

30
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:38,612
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present.

31
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:41,548
I'll open it.

32
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:43,843
It's a Slinky!

33
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:50,742
Remember, huh. Walks down stairs,
alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's...

34
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:55,747
just a big spring. Alright, you still
mad at me becuase of the whole...

35
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:58,386
Horrible and degrading list of
reasons not to be with me?

36
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:02,184
How 'bout from now on we just
call it the 'unfortunate incident'?

37
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,066
Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?

38
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:07,635
Yeah.

39
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,506
Here, go nuts.

40
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:14,144
Hey guys. 
Hey.

41
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:15,184
What's in the bag?

42
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:17,303
Um, just some presents.

43
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:19,752
C'mon show us what you bought...

44
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:21,996
You know you want to.

45
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:31,560
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from
Ben to my parents, huh. 
Cute.

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,949
I got some, uh, hers and hers
towels for Susan and Carol.

47
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,863
And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.

48
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,945
Ross, that is gorgeous! 
Yeah?

49
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:45,771
Look at these authentic fake medals.

50
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:51,557
I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed
at the make-believe military academy.

51
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:52,802
Hey.

52
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:54,151
Hey. Hi Phoebe.

53
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,116
Happy Christmas Eve Eve.

54
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:59,086
Oh my God, where did you get this?

55
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:02,078
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.

56
00:04:02,078 --> 00:04:06,909
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.

57
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,948
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.

58
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:13,719
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.

59
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,871
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.

60
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:17,594
No, that's my stepdad.

61
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:21,027
My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.

62
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,593
How have you never been on Oprah?

63
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,769
OK, look, see, this is him.

64
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:31,185
My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.

65
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:38,945
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy
posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.

66
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:45,690
It's not a blue screen... it's just,
maybe it was just really clear that day.

67
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:50,025
OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.

68
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:53,073
Oh, wait a minute honey. 
Phoebs.

69
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:56,690
Wow.

70
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,249
So anyway, I'm trying to get my
boss's ex-wife to sleep with me...

71
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,800
Joey!

72
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,239
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem,
everyone's all ears!

73
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:11,422
Esther Livingston.

74
00:05:11,422 --> 00:05:13,319
Gone.

75
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:16,700
Hi, Phoe.

76
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,771
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?

77
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:22,587
Oh, just updating the phonebook.

78
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:27,345
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?

79
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:32,986
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?

80
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:38,949
Just, you know, to see... um.

Oh, sure, yeah.

81
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,972
This is the one of you father in a meadow,

82
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:46,755
and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite,

83
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:50,889
and here he is at a graduation....

84
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:55,264
another graduation....

85
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:58,813
another graduation.

86
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:00,965
OK, is this really my father?

87
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:06,989
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.

88
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:11,430
I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause
someone's pants are on fire.

89
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,290
Look, I...

90
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,872
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother
and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.

91
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:23,070
Alright, that is not your father,
that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.

92
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,161
Oh God.

93
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:29,286
It was your mother's idea. Ya know,

94
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:33,190
she didn't want you to know your real father
because it hurt her so much when he left,

95
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,889
and, I didn't want to go along with it, but,

96
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:40,025
well then she died and, and it
was harder to argue with her.

97
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,146
Not impossible, but harder.

98
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:48,165
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon?

99
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:55,791
And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in
a hut in Burma where there's no phones?

100
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,039
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

101
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,950
OK, that makes no sense. Why would
the villagers worship a pharmacist?

102
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:07,666
Honey.

103
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,594
Oh.

104
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:15,343
Anyway, that's all I know.

105
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:20,316
That, and this.

106
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:28,706
This is the real him.

107
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:30,684
Oh.

108
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,070
Ya know I remember my father,

109
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:38,228
all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots,
and the patent leather belt,

110
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:41,159
sneakin around downstairs.
He didn't want anybody to see him

111
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:46,031
but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash
into something and wake everybody up.

112
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,211
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.

113
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,879
Who said anything about Christmas?

114
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:54,994
Hi.

115
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:56,791
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

116
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,307
No, nothin'.

117
00:07:58,307 --> 00:07:59,913
I hope she's OK.

118
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,326
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.

119
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:04,557
How do you know exactly what she's going through?

120
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,582
She told us.

121
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,202
So whaddya got there Monica?

122
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:12,267
Just some stuff for the party.

123
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:15,345
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't
you supposed to be Christmas shopping?

124
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:17,065
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet?

125
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:19,905
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?

126
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:23,911
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?

127
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:27,566
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think
the mailman liked your cookies.

128
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:30,171
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

129
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:37,811
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies,
we just didn't give him enough.

130
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:41,309
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.

131
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,716
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think,
I think I know what'll make you feel better.

132
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:55,597
How 'bout you make a list about me.

133
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:59,318
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand
here and make a list of... 
C'mon Rachel.

134
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:02,908
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive,

135
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:05,874
you are insecure, you're, you're gutless,

136
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:08,244
you know, you don't ever,
you don't just sort of seize the day,

137
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:11,407
you know. You like me for what,
a year, you didn't do anything about it.

138
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:15,956
And, uh, oh, you wear too
much of that gel in your hair.

139
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:23,595
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.

140
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:28,996
Yeah, and you know what? You're right,
I do feel better, thank you Ross.

141
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,025
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have
the number of Frank Buffay...

142
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:42,664
OK, um, in Ithica...

143
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:45,641
alright, um, Saratoga...

144
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:48,010
Oneonta.

145
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,358
Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.

146
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,277
Hey.

147
00:09:57,277 --> 00:10:01,477
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.

148
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:05,829
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me.

149
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:07,151
How's it going?

150
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:13,671
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big,
he's pretty small, you do the math.

151
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:17,225
Well, I think you're better off without him.

152
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:19,745
Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but,

153
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:27,633
but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who
knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.

154
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:33,524
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.

155
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:35,402
I know.

156
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,629
OK.

157
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:44,185
I wasn't completely honest with you when I told
you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.

158
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,827
Whattaya mean?

159
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:52,042
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.

160
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:56,516
If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far.
You can take my cab.

161
00:10:56,516 --> 00:11:00,814
Wow. Thank you.

162
00:11:00,814 --> 00:11:03,485
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.

163
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:08,318
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad.

164
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:15,252
Wish me luck, Grandpa!

165
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:25,786
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

166
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:30,118
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab... hop in.

167
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:32,631
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.

168
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:33,513
Hey, don't worry.

169
00:11:33,513 --> 00:11:37,793
I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house,
they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories,

170
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:40,147
we'll still have plenty of time.

171
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,467
Hey, here she comes. 
Hey.

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,885
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours
I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.

173
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,963
Eeeshk. 
Yeah, big stuff.

174
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,433
OK, let's go. 
OK.

175
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:02,317
Alright, here, you have to hold this.

176
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:07,271
Brake left, gas right?

177
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:09,833
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.

178
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:13,673
Where's my seat belt?

179
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:17,950
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one,
the paramedics had to cut through it.

180
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,286
Hey! 
Hey.

181
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:31,947
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.

182
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:36,710
For the sixteenth time, no...
I do not think you're obsessive.

183
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:40,244
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here. 
Rach, get the heat.

184
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:43,077
Ross, could you turn the heat down please? 
Sure.

185
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:46,161
By the way, there's a difference between being
obsessive and... 
Ross, the heat!

186
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:51,511
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat,
and I'm the obsessive one.

187
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:57,356
OK, this way is on, so this is...

188
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:01,783
off.

189
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:03,195
Did you just break the radiator?

190
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:09,221
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and... here it is.

191
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,445
Well put it back.

192
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:16,010
It uhh, it won't go back.

193
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,269
I'll call the super.

194
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,946
Here, let me try.

195
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:22,915
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.

196
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:26,309
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.

197
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:29,786
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs.

198
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:36,353
Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on
the radiator and it's really hot in here.

199
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:40,602
Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

200
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:44,183
Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6?

201
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:48,762
Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until
Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.

202
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:49,988
OK, tip the man.

203
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:54,035
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad,
I am not gonna be blackmailed.

204
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:58,167
Look if worse comes to worse, it gets
a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.

205
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:02,484
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.

206
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:08,867
Ooh, this is it, 74.

207
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,070
Oh, so that's what this is for.

208
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:17,637
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad.
This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.

209
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,195
Yeah. 
Sure is.

210
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:22,682
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in. 
Alright.

211
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:24,150
Good luck Phoebs.

212
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,108
OK, here I go...

213
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:32,165
here I go...

214
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:34,147
I'm goin'.

215
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:48,920
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party.

216
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,919
You can put your coats and sweaters
and pants and shirts in the bedroom.

217
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,077
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating,

218
00:14:57,077 --> 00:15:02,763
but I use exactly what the gel bottle says,

219
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:09,667
an amount about the size of a pea.
How, how can that be too much?

220
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:16,721
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin. Alright.

221
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:22,206
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.

222
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:24,968
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.

223
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:28,364
Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.

224
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:33,082
Mr. Treeger.

225
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,709
Uhh, you said there was a party.

226
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:38,592
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.

227
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:44,996
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool,
probably 'cause I have so much skin.

228
00:15:44,996 --> 00:15:48,291
Hey, cheese!

229
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:52,910
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give
him cash, Rachel give him your earrings.

230
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,322
Something, now, anything.

231
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:57,148
No, I will not cave.

Yeah, I'm with Mon.

232
00:15:57,148 --> 00:15:59,869
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day?

233
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:02,505
Well, alright, even though he's your super,

234
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:04,434
I'm seizing.

235
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:10,509
Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.

236
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:16,910
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.

237
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,911
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright.

238
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:24,189
Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance
you could fix that radiator now?

239
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:28,997
No can do, like I told the girl,
I can't get a new knob until Thursday.

240
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,919
Ross. 
Yeah.

241
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,227
Looks like he's playin' baseball.

You mean hardball?

242
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:39,475
Whatever.

243
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:40,585
What'cha gonna' do?

244
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:42,952
Excuse me, I'm seizing.

245
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:49,045
Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah.

246
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:52,364
Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?

247
00:16:52,364 --> 00:16:56,568
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday.

248
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:59,146
Am I not saying it right.

249
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,509
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?

250
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:07,877
Oh, yeah, they were so personal,
really showed you cared.

251
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:15,749
Nice seizing... gel boy.

252
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:21,989
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?

253
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:27,191
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.

254
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:33,357
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.

255
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:37,908
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.

256
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,236
OK.

257
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:54,055
How far'd ya get?

Mailbox.

258
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:58,266
Alright, we're gettin' closer.

259
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,267
Phoebs, what's goin' on?

260
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:03,146
No, it's just like, ya know,
it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know.

261
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:08,325
It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this,
like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and,

262
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:11,546
ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and...

263
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:15,391
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's
this really cool pharmacist guy.

264
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:17,187
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

265
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:22,925
You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and,
and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad.

266
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:27,683
Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and
everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know,

267
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:29,746
I'm Franks daughter.

268
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:31,603
Well, so why not go knock?

269
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:40,041
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if,
what if he's not this great dad guy?

270
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:45,706
I mean, what if, what if he's just still the
dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us?

271
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:55,266
You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week

272
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:58,451
and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

273
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:04,629
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.

274
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:05,319
Yeah?

275
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,072
Yeah, and someday when you're ready,
you'll make it past the hedges.

276
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:13,869
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.

277
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:15,629
You guys.

278
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:20,872
I'm sorry about your shopping.

279
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:24,430
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.

280
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:27,594
Uh, listen Phoebs,

281
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:32,853
I know you're not goin' in there but do you think
it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom?

282
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:36,319
Oh, that's fine, never mind.

283
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,748
Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.

284
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,427
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!

285
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,982
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?

286
00:19:56,982 --> 00:20:00,188
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.

287
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:02,435
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.

288
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,088
Oh, I couldn't go in.

289
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:06,868
Honey, I'm sorry. 
Are you OK?

290
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:11,675
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean,
I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.

291
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:15,449
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.

292
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:25,271
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just
turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.

293
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:39,506
Rach, these are for you.

294
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:43,684
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.

295
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:48,790
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.

296
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:52,804
OK, Phoebs, your turn.

297
00:20:54,843 --> 00:21:00,904
Ahh, toilet seat covers!

298
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:03,790
Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?

299
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,388
You guuuyys.

300
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:10,074
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.

301
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:15,070
You got me a cola drink?

302
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,801
And, a lemon lime.

303
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:26,520
Well this, this is too much, I feel like
I should get you another sweater.

304
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,590
