Wow, I don't know what to say.

11
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:51,771
Wow, I, I don't know what to say.

12
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:55,398
- Heh, what d'ya say?
- I don't know.

13
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,354
It's a bracelet.

14
00:00:57,354 --> 00:01:00,040
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,631
To my best bud.

16
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,429
Thanks best bud.

17
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:12,609
- Put it on.
- Oh, now?

18
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:17,715
No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.

19
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:20,957
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything.

20
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:25,558
You put this on, you're good to go.

21
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:29,735
Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.

22
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,009
I so am.

23
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,551
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?

24
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,633
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first

25
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,847
but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.

And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?

Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.

Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper.
Make me a salad.

31
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:48,389
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.

32
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:51,503
No, just a salad will be fine.

33
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:53,336
You got it.

34
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:58,501
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.

35
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:01,716
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.

36
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:02,978
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?

37
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,725
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.

38
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,613
Don't, I like it dirty.

39
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:11,980
That's your call.

40
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,289
So, uh, what are you going to do next?

41
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:17,670
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.

42
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,687
Are they, uh, firm?

43
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:23,372
They'r alright.

44
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:27,990
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?

45
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,415
No really, they're OK.

46
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:36,105
You gonna slice them up real nice?

47
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:39,292
- Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
- Aaaahhhhhhh.

48
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:44,016
I'm outa here.

00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:54,676
Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message?

50
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:59,911
Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band?

51
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,864
OK, bye-bye.

52
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:06,715
- Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?
- Oh, some guy she met at the movies.

53
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,453
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?

54
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:12,579
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . .

55
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:17,119
ya know, make a little love. . .

56
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:20,645

57
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:27,004
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it,

58
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:29,241
I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close.

59
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:32,803
Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies?

60
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:36,883
I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or,

61
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:42,769
Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.

62
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:46,951
- Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
- Wha, OK, now how do you know that?

63
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:51,120
Because she's your lobster.

64
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:54,617
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.

65
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:59,359
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,121
You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank,
ya know, holding claws like. . .

67
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:14,827
Hey, you feelin' better?

68
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:18,421
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.

69
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:20,694
So, do you have any other possibilities?

70
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,394
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.

71
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:26,986
- Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
- No no no,

72
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:31,370
- if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
- Oh OK.

73
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:34,040
Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad?

74
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,680
You feel guilty and tense around them already.

75
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,423
You might as well make some money off of them.

76
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,429
Ya know, the man's got a point.

77
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,979
What is that sparkly thing?

78
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,653
That thing, it's a uhh. . .

79
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:51,761
yeah it's, it's a little flashy.

80
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,275
No no, no no,

81
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:58,228
it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.

82
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,654
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.

83
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:10,999
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi darling.

84
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,295
- So, what's this.
- Some of your old stuff.

85
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:19,002
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.

86
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:24,893
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?

87
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:30,976
Gosh, we talked about that
but your brother has so many science trophies
and plaques and merit badges,

88
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:34,694
- well we didn't want to disturb them.
- Oh, God forbid.

89
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,751
- Oh, hi Rachel.
- Hi.

90
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:43,935
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.

91
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:47,616
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.

92
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:51,495
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised.

93
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:55,069
Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them.

94
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,868
Especially after that incident in Hawaii.

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,249
What, what incident?

96
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:06,887
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me.

97
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,076
Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.

98
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:16,396
- Do you want a refill?
- No, I'm alright, thanks.

99
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:24,201
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right.

100
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:30,992
Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out.

101
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:36,401
That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.

102
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:48,294
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

103
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:52,502
- I'm Gail.
- Chandler.

104
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:56,259
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.

105
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,275
What?

106
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:08,459
Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs,

107
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,183
but no, he has to get me the woman repeller,

108
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:15,805
the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.

109
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:17,251
It's not that bad.

110
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:21,070
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.

111
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,467
Chandler, Chandler.

112
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:27,021
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . .

113
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:29,706

Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her.

117
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:55,669
It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.

118
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,399
I think she's OK.

119
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,371
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge.

120
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:05,263
Alright, I'm gonna do something.

00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:55,250
I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.

151
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:57,827
Well, but, but. . .

152
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:04,297
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.

153
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:08,599
E-except, except that what?

154
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:14,755
- No, no, ACC-cept that.
- Oh.

155
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,697
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin?

156
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,343
Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing.

157
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,892
Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say?

158
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,646
OK, that's my bad.

159
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,864
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.

160
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:50,698
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though 
I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?

161
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,302
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?

162
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:57,944
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank.

163
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:01,181
But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.

164
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:04,802
Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times,

165
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:08,958
I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist.

166
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,097
But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, 
you know, you just uh, you stay in there.

167
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,153
You know what the. . .

168
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:22,733
I am here, on my knees,

169
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:29,284
holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret,

170
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:32,506
much like they did in biblical times.

171
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:35,838
Though you may haveth anger now. . .

172
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:45,386
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush.

173
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:48,309
I'm just saying, it's right there.

174
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,373
- Hey guys.
- Hi, darling.

175
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:53,382
Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?

176
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:55,748
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.

177
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,494
A woman in my office is a lesiban.

178
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:02,098
I'm just saying.

179
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:05,543
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.

180
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:11,456
Where have you been?

181
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,632
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?

182
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:18,421
- No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
- C'mon Monica, do it.

183
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,493
Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.

184
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:30,965
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, 
I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.

185
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:36,938
- Why?
- Because they made me.

186
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,801
You were fired? What're you gonna do?

187
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:45,110
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about.

188
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,164
We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?

189
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:50,326
In the bank.

190
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:56,171
There you go. So she dips into her savings, 
that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine,

191
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,394
and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.

192
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:01,939
Anything larger back there?

193
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:05,070
I can't believe it.

194
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:09,490
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.

195
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:12,449
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay.

196
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,466
Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars 
to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with.

197
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:18,513
Bring on the hay.

198
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:20,560
Hey.

199
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:27,036
I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?

200
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:30,598
Hey now you have two.

201
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:34,254
Oh, now you have two.

202
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:38,441
What am I gonna do, huh?

203
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:39,378
Hey.

204
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:42,350
Hey.

205
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:44,345
How come you have two?

206
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:49,018
Well this one's for you.

207
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,169
- Get out.
- No, I can't.

208
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:57,945
No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you 
and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,

209
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:03,859
it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.

210
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,370
Wow, is this friendship? I think so.

211
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,320
Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.

212
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,674
That's what they'll call us.

213
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:18,414
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.

214
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:21,797
You have dinosaur checks?

215
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:26,035
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and 
you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?

216
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:30,289
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus.

217
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,179
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.

218
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:40,371
Hey, Mon, what is this?

219
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:44,682
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.

220
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:50,038
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.

221
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,697
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?

222
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:54,232
Hey, you got me, put it in.

223
00:15:57,511 --> 00:16:00,001
- Oh.
- Hi.
- Hi.

224
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:05,434
Over here Jack. OK.

225
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:09,334
I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty.

226
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,241
Jack, get this.

227
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,222
Oh my God.

228
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:16,968
What is with your nose?

229
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,460
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.

230
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:26,525
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.

231
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:30,791
- You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
- Oh.

232
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,706
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.

233
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:36,664
Oh yeah we do. C'mon.

234
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:39,148
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.

235
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:40,904
Over here dad.

236
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:47,193
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.

237
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:51,822
Some girl ate Monica.

238
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:56,091
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.

239
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:58,977
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?

240
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:04,622
Oh, you look so great.

241
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,381
Ahh, so do you, beautiful.

242
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,117
- Oops.
- What?

243
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:10,616
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.

244
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:13,278
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.

245
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:17,091
Everybody smile.

246
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:20,132
- Oh, dad, turn it off.
- It is off.

247
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,903
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?

248
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:24,789
It's the off light.

249
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,122
Right Ross?

250
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:36,238
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.

251
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:42,660
- You look pretty tonight.
- Oh, thanks.

252
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:48,241
So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?

253
00:17:48,242 --> 00:17:51,651
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.

254
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,396
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .

255
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:07,787
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .

256
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:10,011
Oh, the guys are here.

257
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:11,406
this summer?

258
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:12,896
Work on your music?

259
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:24,036
- Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
- Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times.

260
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,883
His name was in the paper.

261
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:30,138
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?

262
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:35,564
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.

263
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,526
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.

264
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:51,989
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.

265
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,472
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.

266
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:57,023
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.

267
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:02,236
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.

268
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:04,732
Doubtful.

269
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,931
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.

270
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,655
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.

271
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:19,435
- Dad, she won't want to go with me.
- Of course she would, you're a college man.

272
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:23,470
- I don't know.
- Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?

273
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:31,286
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.

274
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:35,847
- OK. Hold my board.
- Atta boy.

275
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,781
OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.

276
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:39,507
No, no, no.

277
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:41,189
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.

278
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,400
C'mon kid, let's go.

279
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,276
- Ahh, are you hadsome.
- Let's show 'em.

280
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:51,953
Uh, just a sec dad.

281
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:55,745
OK, be cool, just be cool.

282
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:10,731
- OK dad.
- Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . .

283
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:12,234
oh no.

284
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:14,038
Bye.

285
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:21,182
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?

286
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:24,395
- Press the button.
- Which one? Which button, Jack.

287
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,319
The button, the button.

288
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:31,941
I can't believe you did that.

289
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,336
Yeah, well.

290
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:05,971
See, he's her lobster.

291
00:21:13,094 --> 00:21:15,204
Dance with him.

292
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:18,450
- Mom, I'm hungry.
- Dance with your father.

293
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:22,761
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.

294
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:25,001
Alright.

295
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:36,760
- Oh, Jack.
- Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy.

296
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:41,578
Oh, ohhhhh.
