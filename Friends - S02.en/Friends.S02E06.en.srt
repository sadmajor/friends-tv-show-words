1
00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:04,317
Who da wenny-Benny boy?

2
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:15,987
You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry.

3
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:18,416
Why is he still crying?

4
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:25,785
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.

5
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:27,206
Maye it's me.

6
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:31,027
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.

7
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:34,789
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants.

8
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:38,077
Lovely girl, kinda moody.

9
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:40,370
There we go. All better.

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,147
There's my little boy.

11
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,847
Can I uh see something?

12
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:04,986
Cool.

13
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:07,793
He hates me. My nephew hates me.

14
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:08,866
Come on, don't do this.

15
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:11,710
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? 
What am I gonna do then?

16
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,546
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts.

17
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:18,117
Do you know how long it's gonna be before
you actually have to deal with this problem?

18
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:22,944
I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet.

19
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,426
Joey, she does not look fat.

20
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:21,997
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!

21
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:24,831
That is so funny. Let me see that.

22
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:32,762
Are you ok, Ross?

23
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:36,229
I don't know.

24
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:37,879
What's in this pie?

25
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,628
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--

26
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:46,080
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.

27
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,031
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.

28
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:53,787
And that's what's gonna kill me.

29
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:55,481
I'm allergic to kiwi.

30
00:02:55,481 --> 00:03:01,225
No you're not. You're, you're allergic
to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.

31
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,677
Oh my god.

32
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:05,985
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.

33
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,186
Is your tongue swelling up?

34
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,521
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.

35
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:12,753
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.

36
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:15,562
Is he gonna be ok?

Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.

37
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:22,021
You know, you know, actually it's getting better.
It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?

38
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:23,640
Jacket now.

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,963
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.

40
00:03:27,963 --> 00:03:29,984
We'll watch him.

41
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:32,556
I don't think tho.

42
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:37,245
What? I have seven Catholic sisters.
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

43
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:39,387
Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?

44
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:44,425
I was looking forward to playing basketball,
but I guess that's out the window.

45
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:47,466
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk,
you might wanna bring his hat,

46
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:50,368
and there's extra milk in the fridge,
and there's extra diapers in the bag.

47
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:54,547
Hat, milk, got it.

48
00:03:54,547 --> 00:04:02,107
Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!

49
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:03,834
Consider it done.

50
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:04,823
You understood that?

51
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:09,502
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

52
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:12,489
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?

53
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,044
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song
I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon?

54
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:22,650
I wrote it this morning in the shower.

55
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,640
Ok.

56
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,520
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song.

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,632
Stop me if you've heard it.

58
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:40,244
My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet,

59
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:45,599
and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.

60
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:53,165
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?

61
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,386
What's up?

62
00:04:57,386 --> 00:05:03,343
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional
musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.

63
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:07,489
Her name is Stephanie... something.
She's supposed to be very good.

64
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,315
But what about Phoebe?

65
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:12,830
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad,

66
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,909
it's that she's so bad,

67
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:25,814
she makes me want to put my finger through
my eye into my brain and swirl it around.

68
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:31,391
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean,
come on, you cannot do this to her.

69
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,524
Uh--

70
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:37,279
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no.
I have to do this to her?

71
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:47,966
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse,
repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.

72
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,757
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff.
Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?

73
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,130
I'm telling you It's gonna be worth it.

74
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,118
It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ?

75
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:07,141
Women love guys who love babies.
It's that whole sensitive thing.

76
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:11,557
Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.
Maybe one of them will break away.

77
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:16,026
No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left.
All right, gimme the baby.

78
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,228
No, I got him. 
No, seriously.

79
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:20,763
Oh, seriously you want him?

80
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:24,687
Hello. 
Hello.

81
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:26,466
And who is this little cutie pie?

82
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:31,928
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?

83
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:33,290
You wanna smell him?

84
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,867
I assume we're talking about the baby now.

85
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:43,074
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

86
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:46,106
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.

87
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,369
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?

88
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,319
I think it's great you guys are doing this.

89
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,430
Well, we are great guys.

90
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,566
You know, my brother and his boyfriend
have been trying to adopt for three years.

91
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:57,226
What agency did you two go through?

92
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:04,707
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play.

93
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:10,685
My, my name is written out there in chalk.
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

94
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,468
Honey, I'm sorry.

95
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,985
And he's going to be paying this woman?

96
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:19,246
Why doesn't he just give her like a throne,

97
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:25,368
and a crown, and like a, you know,
gold stick with a ball on top.

98
00:07:25,368 --> 00:07:29,183
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're
always saying "Terry's a jerk!"

99
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:32,824
That's where that came from.

100
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:37,996
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.

101
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:43,003
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me
just see what else I can do.

102
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:44,263
All right, look, look.

103
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,523
Why don't you just let her go on after
Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean,

104
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:50,275
you won't even be here. You don't pay her.
It's not gonna cost you anything.

105
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:51,389
I, I don't know.

106
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,584
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.

107
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:57,404
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?

108
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:04,470
Of course I clean it. I mean, I, I will cleeeean it.
I mean, I will cleeeean it.

109
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,262
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.

110
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,993
Done. 
Really?

111
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,792
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?

112
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:20,665
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting.
How much am I gonna get?

113
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:22,627
What?

114
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,633
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.

115
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:30,988
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying
that other woman beause she's a professional.

116
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:34,370
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one
who's not getting paid.

117
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,322
Well, but Pheebs.

118
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:39,224
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not
some like sloppy second,

119
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:41,431
you know charity band.

120
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:43,947
You know what, there are thousands
of places in this city

121
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:46,677
where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.

122
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:51,010
When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity.

123
00:08:51,010 --> 00:09:00,248
Thank you! La la la la la la la....

124
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,999
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.

125
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:07,668
Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt
it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.

126
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:13,651
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see
someone's having an allergic reaction.

127
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:18,503
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please?

128
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:22,279
My brother has a slight phobia about needles.

129
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,624
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?

130
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:31,520
My brother, the PhD would like to know
if there's any way to treat this orally.

131
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,521
No, under these circumstances it has
to be an injection, and it has to be now.

132
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:41,745
Tho? Ohhh.

133
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:45,143
That's good, have a seat. Um,
the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.

134
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:51,190
You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?
Can you do that for me?

135
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,184
Ok.

136
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:57,172
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good.

137
00:09:57,172 --> 00:10:00,008
You wanna squeeze my hand? ok.

138
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:01,985
All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

139
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:04,465
Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!

140
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,712
Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!

141
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,067
That's a good plan, Joe.

142
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:15,186
Next time we wanna pick up women, we
should just go to the park and make out.

143
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:17,041
Taxi, taxi!

144
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:23,205
Hey, hey, look at that talent.

145
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:27,064
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.

146
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:32,793
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

147
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:38,438
Ok, but can you tell him that,
because he thinks he's too pink.

148
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,910
So what are you guys out doing today?

149
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,114
Oh we're not out.

150
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:45,290
No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys,

151
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:51,527
hanging with the son of our other heterosexual
friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.

152
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,874
You done? 
Yeah.

153
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:55,467
Oh, there's our stop.

154
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:58,426
Get outta here. This is our stop too.

155
00:10:58,426 --> 00:10:59,608
You guys live around here too?

156
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:05,284
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the
building by the uh sidewalk.

157
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:07,997
You know it?

158
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:13,632
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all,
what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?

159
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:19,666
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?

160
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,635
Oh, sure, they love us over there.

161
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:23,441
Where's your baby?

162
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:36,588
Ben! Ben! Ben!

163
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:40,024
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear
you and pull the cord.

164
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:46,359
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!

165
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,439
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.

166
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:54,953
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

167
00:11:54,953 --> 00:12:01,144
And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.

168
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:05,997
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry!

169
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:09,626
Hey! Hey! I got my s's back!

170
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:15,161
Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.

171
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:22,198
... with the double double double-jointed boy.

172
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:26,624
Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?

173
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:28,718
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.

174
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:34,366
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake".

175
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:38,112
So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?

176
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,160
All of them.

177
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,566
Oh yeah, so you know D?

178
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:42,704
Yeah.

179
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:45,244
Ok, do you know A minor?

180
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:46,187
Yeah.

181
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:50,722
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?

182
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:53,184
Yeah.

183
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:57,707
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?

184
00:12:57,707 --> 00:12:58,824
No.

185
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:03,678
Oh. Mine does.

186
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:08,278
Stephanie knows all the chords.

187
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,504
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority?

188
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:15,480
Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book,

189
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,386
and I was wondering what someone
might do if they left a baby on a city bus.

190
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:24,232
Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.

191
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:26,985
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today.

192
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:29,601
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.

193
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,275
Oh, and there was a baby in it.

194
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:36,683
He wants to talk to you again.

195
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:40,108
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice
warm Central Perk welcome to--

196
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:45,382
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work,
and I hate Central Perk!

197
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:51,966
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.

198
00:13:55,688 --> 00:14:00,894
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that
I wrote for the first man I ever loved.

199
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:05,528
Zachary.

200
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:09,210
You're all invited to bite me!

201
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:21,355
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby.
We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?

202
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:22,869
He's here.

203
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:31,112
I'm assuming one of you is the father.

That's me. 
I'm him.

204
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:35,626
Actually, uh, we're both the father.

205
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:46,745
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!

206
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:55,143
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.

207
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:59,154
Well, well that one has ducks on his
t-shirt, and this one has clowns.

208
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:04,195
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

Ok. 
Or clowns.

209
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:08,385
Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember,
he had that cute little mole by his mouth.

210
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:09,389
Yeah? 
Yeah.

211
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:15,526
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.

212
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:17,745
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?

213
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:20,985
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.

214
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:22,144
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?

215
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,591
You got a better idea?

216
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:26,545
All right, call it in the air.

217
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:27,745
Heads.

218
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:29,562
Heads it is. 
Yes! Whew!

219
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:35,549
We have to assign heads to something.

220
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:44,031
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads,
because ducks have heads.

221
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:51,197
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?

222
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:31,962
Hey. 
Oh, hi.

223
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:34,790
Here. I thought you might be cold.

224
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,983
Thank you.

225
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,716
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.

226
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:48,483
Eight dollars and 27 cents.

227
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:52,428
But not really, 'cause I put in the first two,

228
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:57,103
just to, you know, get the ball rolling,
and to make myself feel better.

229
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,225
Do you?

230
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:04,385
No. This whole like playing-for-money
thing is so not good for me.

231
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:10,122
You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide",

232
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:16,078
I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat",

233
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,358
I got 25 cents and a condom.

234
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:25,187
So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.

235
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:30,629
Well, you know, honey, I don't think
everybody gets Smelly Cat.

236
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:37,265
You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!

237
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:42,743
It's not even that. I used to do my songs
because it made me happy,

238
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:49,064
but now it's like, it's just all about the money.

239
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:54,704
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact,
there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".

240
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:56,907
Really? From who?

241
00:17:56,907 --> 00:18:04,927
Well, from me. And I know it's not your
big money song, but it's my favorite.

242
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:14,640
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case?

243
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,143
It's kind of an emergency.

244
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:18,479
Yeah. Here you go.

245
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:22,461
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!

246
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:33,221
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today.
And I'm sorry I, I almost broke your hand.

247
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:37,307
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.

248
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:40,843
Yeah. Hey, remember the time
I jammed that pencil into your hand?

249
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:46,144
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?

250
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:49,399
Wait, what about the time I hit you in
the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?

251
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:52,490
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck
that broom in your bike spokes,

252
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,954
and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?

253
00:18:54,954 --> 00:19:00,319
No. But I remember people telling me about it.

254
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,425
I hope Ben has a little sister.

255
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:07,281
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.

256
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:10,156
I'm gonna get a new band-aid.

257
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:13,505
Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?

258
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:16,104
That was you?

259
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:21,405
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.

260
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:28,705
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one.

261
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:38,386
There's my little baby Ben. Hey,
my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.

262
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:45,226
Hey, he's not crying.

263
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:52,506
Yes! There's still pie.

264
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:57,805
I'm here. How's my little boy?

265
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:02,079
Want Daddy to change your diaper? I know, I know

266
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,505
So, did you have fun with Uncle
Joey and Uncle Chandler today?

267
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:12,634
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.

268
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:21,036
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question.

269
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:28,520
How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?

270
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,769
You, you are gonna love this.

271
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:35,306
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.

272
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:40,073
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!

273
00:20:44,513 --> 00:20:50,552
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?

274
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:59,186
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".

275
00:20:59,186 --> 00:21:02,983
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...

276
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:04,623
Better. Yeah. 
Yeah?

277
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:08,024
Yeah, much better. And you know what,
don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.

278
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,183
Yeah.

279
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:11,421
You wanna try it again?

280
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:12,944
Yeah. From the top?

281
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:20,143
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat.

282
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:23,784
Um, why don't you just follow me?

283
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:37,834
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.

284
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:40,210
That's too much. Sorry.
