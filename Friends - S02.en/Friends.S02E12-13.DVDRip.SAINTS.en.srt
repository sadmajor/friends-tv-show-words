1
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,507
Can't get the monkey off your back?

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,005
Then put it in your mouth...

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,872
...with Monkeyshine Beer!

4
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,682
Get it, monkey

5
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,751
Get it, get it, monkey

6
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,254
Monkey, monkey

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,583
Monkeyshine Beer.

8
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,220
Because it's a jungle out there!

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,089
That commercial always
makes me so sad.

10
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,629
But then the guy opens his beer
and girls run at him...

11
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,767
...so everything works out okay.

12
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,238
I meant because the monkey
reminds me of Marcel.

13
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,532
I can see that.

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,405
Because they both have those big
brown eyes and the little pouty chin.

15
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,272
And the fact that
they're both monkeys?

16
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,845
I wonder if I did the right thing,
giving him away.

17
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:58,285
Ross, you had to. He was
humping everything in sight.

18
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,357
My Malibu Barbie will no longer
be wearing white to her wedding.

19
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,262
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,266
...and when you got it back,
there'd be monkey raisins in it?

21
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:17,335
When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss's hat...

22
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,678
Suddenly, I had this big
"attitude problem."

23
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:27,817
The One With the Super Bowl

24
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,095
Hey, check it out!
Guess what I got?

25
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,560
Rhythm?

26
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,727
No. My first fan mail!

27
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,366
"Dear Dr. Ramoray:

28
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,709
I love you and would do
anything to have you."

29
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:28,471
My gosh! "Your not-so-secret
admirer, Erika Ford."

30
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,538
Oh, wait.

31
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:35,287
"P.S. Enclosed, please find
14 of my eyelashes."

32
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,850
In Crazy World, that means
you're married.

33
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,827
It's not addressed to Days Of Our
Lives. This came to your apartment.

34
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,556
She was in our building.

35
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,199
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,870
I got my very own stalker!

37
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,277
You are so lucky, I'm gonna share mine.

38
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:05,250
Joey, remember we talk about good
thing and bad thing. This is a bad thing.

39
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,278
Where are you off to?

40
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,185
There's a paleontology
conference in L.A.

41
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,462
So I figured I'd go and drive down
to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

42
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,995
He will be surprised.
Till he realizes he's a monkey...

43
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,360
...and isn't capable of that emotion.

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,200
Phoebe? That really cute guy
is here again.

45
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,875
Okay, so everyone...

46
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,377
...pretend I'm telling you a story
and it's really funny.

47
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,641
So everyone just laugh. Now!

48
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,053
I know, I know!

49
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,657
I'm Rob Donan.

50
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,060
Hi, Rob Donan.

51
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,421
I don't know anything about music,
but I think you're really great.

52
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:59,303
Anyway, I schedule performers
for children's libraries.

53
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:04,202
And I was thinking, have you thought
about playing your songs for kids?

54
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,910
I would love to have kids...

55
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,783
...hear me play the songs
that I will write for them.

56
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,513
What do we do for dinner?

57
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,724
We could cook for ourselves.

58
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,831
It's Erika.

59
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,661
My God. The stalker!

60
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,095
Never mind. It's open.

61
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,205
Hitting her with a frying pan
is a good idea.

62
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,001
But we want a backup plan,
just in case she isn't a cartoon!

63
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,106
Let's get out of here!

64
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,310
The one time they're not home!

65
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,954
We'll leave.
When we pass her...

66
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,624
...she won't know me,
because we never met!

67
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,554
That's how radio stars
escape stalkers!

68
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,133
She's coming!

69
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,472
It's me.

70
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,006
This is it.
This is how we're gonna die.

71
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,145
You ready?

72
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,948
Wait, wait, wait!

73
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,682
Erika!

74
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,469
- Mr. Geller?
- Yes, hi.

75
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,365
Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

76
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,300
You had a question?

77
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,571
I can't find the monkey I donated
last year. He's a capuchin...

78
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,007
...answers to the name Marcel?

79
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,842
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

80
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,418
Marcel has passed on.

81
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,782
Oh, my God. What happened?

82
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,618
He got sick,
and then he got sicker...

83
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,830
...and then he got a little better.

84
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,056
But then he died.

85
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,069
I can't believe this!

86
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:17,004
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.
But you know, there's an old saying:

87
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,835
"Sometimes monkeys die."

88
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,914
It's not a great saying...

89
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,212
...but it certainly is fitting today.

90
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,354
- Someone should've called me.
- I'm sorry.

91
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,423
Look, I know this can't
bring him back...

92
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,593
...but here, it's just a gesture.

93
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,689
Zoo dollars?

94
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:43,196
Yes, and come see the bird show
at 4. The macaws wear hats.

95
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,897
It's a lot cuter
if your monkey hasn't just died.

96
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,978
I know.

97
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,315
I can't believe Joey's having
lunch with his stalker!

98
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,021
What is she like?

99
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,657
You remember Kathy Bates in Misery?

100
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,952
Well, she looks
the exact opposite of that.

101
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,962
And she's not crazy?

102
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,223
Oh, no, no.
She's a total whack-job.

103
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,963
She thinks that Joey is
actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

104
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,740
Oh, my God!

105
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,833
And he's going out with her?

106
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,737
He cannot pursue this.

107
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,479
Just because this woman sees Joey
through the magical box...

108
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,183
...in her living room
doesn't mean she's not a person.

109
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,885
Does she not deserve happiness?
Does she not deserve love?

110
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,150
Why are you looking at me? He's
the one who wants to boff the maniac!

111
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,520
Are you okay?

112
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,763
No. I'm just nervous.

113
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,229
Maybe if I just picture them all
in their underwear...

114
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,596
That's not a good idea. That's
the reason the last guy got fired.

115
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,910
I'm used to playing for grownups.

116
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,214
Grownups drink their coffee
and do their grownup thing.

117
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,909
And kids...

118
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,242
...listen.

119
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,181
It's just a huge responsibility.

120
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,582
What?

121
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,719
Are you gonna kiss me?

122
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,961
I was thinking about it.

123
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,860
Alrighty! Let's play some tunes!

124
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:26,872
Ok! Let's find some seats.

125
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,671
Chandle, we gonna find our seats.

126
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,068
Hold on a second.

127
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:32,878
He thinks he can.

128
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,882
He thinks he can.

129
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,249
Oh, what the hell.

130
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,183
He can.

131
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,725
- Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.
- Hi, Phoebe!

132
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,493
I'm gonna play some songs
about grandparents, okay?

133
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,267
Now Grandma's a person
Who everyone likes

134
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,475
She bought you a train
And a bright shiny bike

135
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,643
But lately she hasn't
Been coming to dinner

136
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,211
And last time you saw her
She looked so much thinner

137
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,615
Now your mom and your dad said
She moved to Peru

138
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,254
But the truth is she died
And someday you will too

139
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:23,261
I will have the great seven,
and the doctor, will have the resertal.

140
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,077
- Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
- Yeah, it is.

141
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,841
What?

142
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,377
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...

143
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,918
...and a while ago you were
reattaching Simone's spinal cord.

144
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,384
That was a tricky one.

145
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,259
In reality...

146
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,622
...that operation takes 10 hours.
But they only showed it for 2 minutes.

147
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,429
Who's "they"?

148
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,594
No one.

149
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:11,203
Drake, you are so talented.
Let me see those hands.

150
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,876
Oh, these hands,
these beautiful hands.

151
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,814
I could just eat them.

152
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,344
But I won't.

153
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,416
Otherwise my watch would fall off.

154
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,492
No, seriously.

155
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,192
These hands...

156
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,091
...these miracle, magical,
life-giving hands.

157
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,336
Just to be near them, touch them,
maybe even lick one?

158
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,833
All right. Just one.

159
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,147
You're good at that.

160
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,989
Oh, my God! Someone!
He's choking!

161
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,191
Is anyone here a doctor?

162
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,561
Yes, the best doctor in Salem!

163
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,624
Dr. Drake Ramoray!

164
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,809
Meet me in the nocturnal
house in 15 minutes.

165
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,680
Hey, look. I don't really enjoy
being with other men that way.

166
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,126
But, zoo dollars?

167
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,329
It's about your monkey!

168
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,960
It's alive.

169
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,741
I don't understand.
Why didn't you help that man?

170
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,842
Because I'm a neurosurgeon...

171
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,317
...and that was clearly a case of...

172
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,184
..."foodal chokage."

173
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,422
I gotta tell you something

174
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,231
You don't have to tell me anything.

175
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,867
You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

176
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,074
Who am I to question
the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?

177
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,343
I should be happy to be near you.

178
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:26,643
Hey, I

179
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,980
Hey what?

180
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,683
That's it. Just hey!

181
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,718
Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

182
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,060
There'll be times when you get older

183
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,026
When you'll want to sleep with people

184
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,532
Just to make them like you
But don't!

185
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,903
'Cause...

186
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,005
...that's another thing...

187
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,642
...that you don't wanna do
Everybody!

188
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:04,678
That's another thing
That you don't wanna do

189
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,115
- Excellent!
- Very informative!

190
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,854
Not at all inappropriate!

191
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:15,225
Thank you for coming, everybody!
There are cookies in the back.

192
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,128
That was great.

193
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,455
The kids loved you.

194
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,800
Yea! I rock!

195
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,333
And you know why?
Because you told the truth.

196
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,663
Nobody ever tells kids the truth.

197
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,574
You were incredible!

198
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:32,908
But...?

199
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,742
- How'd you know there was a "but"?
- I sense these things.

200
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,211
It was either "but" or "butter."

201
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,383
The thing is, I think
some of the parents...

202
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,280
...they were hoping that...

203
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,319
...you'd play more songs
about barnyard animals.

204
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:49,956
I can do that.

205
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,161
Really?

206
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,264
Because that would be fantastic!

207
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,699
What? You wanna kiss me?

208
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,664
I'm thinking about it.

209
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,678
So by the libery car carticuler,
we still have some time.

210
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,653
What, I'm unemploy.

211
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,649
The bat.

212
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,296
Ambassador of darkness.

213
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,563
Flitting out of his cave
like a winged messenger.

214
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,301
Sightless specter of the macabre.

215
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,732
Buddy, my monkey?

216
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,970
Oh, yeah, right.

217
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,868
There was a break-in...

218
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,739
...a few months back.
Inside job.

219
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,414
Your monkey was taken.

220
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,990
The zoo told me
that my monkey was dead!

221
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,960
The zoo!

222
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,865
You believe everything
the zoo tells you?

223
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,734
That's the only thing
the zoo's ever told me.

224
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,506
Of course they'll say that!
They don't want the bad publicity.

225
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,438
It's all a great big cover-up.

226
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,112
Do you have any idea
how high up this thing goes?

227
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,106
That guy Lipson?

228
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,584
Lipson knows?

229
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,589
- Do you have idea who else knows?
- I only know Lipson.

230
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,758
Lipson knows, huh?

231
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,060
Hello, Mr. Possum.

232
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:34,159
Enigma of the trees,
upside-down denizen of the night.

233
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,368
- Taunting gravity
- Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?

234
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,168
Word on the street

235
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,466
When I say "street," I mean those
pretend streets here at the zoo.

236
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,938
Of course.

237
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,848
Your monkey found a new career...

238
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,314
...in the entertainment field.
That's all I know.

239
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,283
This is unbelievable!

240
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:03,324
So what is this information
worth to you, my friend?

241
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,731
Are you trying
to get me to bribe you?

242
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,259
Maybe.

243
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,503
But you already told me everything.

244
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,012
Check it out.

245
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,850
He actually is
the Monkeyshine monkey!

246
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,547
What'll you do?

247
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,984
I'm gonna call the beer company
and try to find him.

248
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,092
That's what I did
when I lost my Clydesdales.

249
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,662
Okay, hi again!

250
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,524
Hi, Phoebe!

251
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:48,038
Today, we're gonna start with
some songs about barnyard animals.

252
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,375
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

253
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,645
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

254
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,143
Then the farmer hits him
And grinds him up

255
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,474
And that's how we get hamburgers

256
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,819
Now chickens!

257
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,159
Only you who can save her, Drake!

258
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,985
Damn it! I'm a doctor.
I'm not God!

259
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,321
There goes my whole belief system.

260
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,996
It's Erika.

261
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,702
Quick! Shut off the TV.

262
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,699
I wanna see what happens!

263
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,201
I get Leslie out of the
coma then we make out.

264
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,807
How can that be?
You were kissing Sabrina!

265
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,878
Rachel, it's a world
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

266
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,683
Hey, Erika. Come in.

267
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,151
How did you get here so fast?
I just saw you in Salem.

268
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,357
Right, they choppered me in.

269
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,054
What's up?

270
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,296
You're having a little party too!

271
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,827
- Is she here?
- Who?

272
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,327
Sabrina. I know about you two!

273
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,538
I saw you today, kissing
in the doctor's lounge.

274
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,740
It's not what you think

275
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,535
You told me I was the only one!

276
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,907
All right, look.
That's it.

277
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,082
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

278
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,717
I should have told you
a long time ago...

279
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,923
...but I am not Drake Ramoray.

280
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:16,059
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.

281
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,421
Oh, my God! Do the people
at the hospital know?

282
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,370
Somebody wanna help me out here?

283
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,696
Oh, I know! I know!

284
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,604
Where am I?

285
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,307
University Hospital...

286
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,135
...where you've been
for the last 18 years.

287
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,309
How can you be here and there?

288
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,607
Because it's a TV show!

289
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,079
What are you getting at?

290
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,791
Nice girl, not great with concept.

291
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,192
I'm not Drake!

292
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,258
That's right!
He's not Drake. He's...

293
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,293
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!

294
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,897
Is this true?

295
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,243
Yes! Yes, it is true!

296
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,238
And I know this...

297
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,810
...because he pretended
to be Drake to sleep with me!

298
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,020
And then he told me
he would run away with me!

299
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,453
And he didn't!

300
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,894
And you left the toilet seat up,
you bastard!

301
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,330
Is all this true?

302
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,407
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

303
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,837
You deserve much better than me.

304
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:47,312
You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.

305
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,945
Go to Salem. Find him!

306
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,223
He's the guy for you!

307
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,981
Oh, Hans!

308
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,929
Hans?

309
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,164
Hans!

310
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,755
Yo, evil twin!

311
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,532
Right. Goodbye, Erika.

312
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,103
Good luck in Salem.

313
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,205
Take care.

314
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,004
I'll never forget you, Hans.

315
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,577
All right.
The people who threw the water!

316
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,753
Helping you out!

317
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,353
Fired?

318
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,019
Why?

319
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,692
The library board got a lot
of complaints from parents...

320
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,430
...about the stuff in your songs.

321
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,360
I can't believe this is the libery!

322
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,360
- I mean, books, freespeech,
newspapers on sticks. - I know.

323
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,566
What about the kids.

324
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,737
Did you tell your board that
the kids want to hear the truth?

325
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,650
I see.

326
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,752
Maybe if you just played
some regular kiddy songs?

327
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,222
What do you want me to be?
Like some...

328
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:04,190
...stupid, big,
like, purple dinosaur?

329
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,697
You don't have to be Barney.

330
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,627
Who's Barney?

331
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,849
I tracked down Marcel and get this.
He's healthy, he's happy...

332
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,028
...and he's in New York filming
Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.

333
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,458
You're kidding!

334
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,694
- This is amazing!
- I know.

335
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,301
I finally get a part on TV,
and the monkey's making movies.

336
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,397
Rachel, I'm ready.

337
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,649
Excuse me. Is this where the
singing lady is, who tells the truth?

338
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,711
I guess that's me.

339
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,490
She's here!

340
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,896
Sometimes men love women

341
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,726
Sometimes men love men

342
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,537
Then there are bisexuals

343
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,674
Though some just say
They're kidding themselves

344
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,377
This is exciting! I haven't
seen my monkey in a year.

345
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,055
What, you never
look down in the shower?

346
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,924
I'm not allowed to make one joke
in the "monkey is penis" genre?

347
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,891
Back up, please.

348
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,530
Back up. Come on.

349
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,302
Excuse me.
Where can we find the monkey?

350
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,968
I'm sorry.
It's a closed set.

351
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,399
I'm sorry, you don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.

352
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,700
We used to live together.

353
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:02,105
And I have a time share
in the Poconos with Flipper.

354
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,081
There he is!

355
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,446
Hey! Buddy!

356
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,052
Marcel! Marcel!

357
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,093
In the jungle

358
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,195
The mighty jungle

359
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,230
The lion sleeps tonight

360
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,072
In the jungle
The mighty jungle

361
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,140
The lion sleeps tonight

362
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,870
Excuse me, this is a

363
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:08,408
Closed set. We know.
But we're friends with the monkey.

364
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,076
Good morning.

365
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,982
Look who I brought!

366
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,119
Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!

367
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,684
Whoa, dude. Burn!

368
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,291
I don't get it.

369
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,622
He seemed so happy
to see me yesterday.

370
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:31,198
Don't take it personal. He's under
pressure, starring in a movie and all.

371
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,906
How big of a star is Marcel?

372
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,142
In human terms? I'd say...

373
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,135
...Cybill Shepherd.

374
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:47,182
So you guys in the movie
or you just really paranoid?

375
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,554
Hey, Sal?

376
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,948
Jerry wants to know
if the monkey's ready.

377
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,054
Excuse me?

378
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,053
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

379
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,819
- The one in the director's chair?
- Gotcha.

380
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,931
Pheebs, walk with me.

381
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,868
Why am I walking with you?

382
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:09,540
We're just going over here
so that we can get away from...

383
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,265
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

384
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,876
For the love of God, woman,
listen to me!

385
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,347
Is he looking? Is he looking?

386
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,353
- We've got a problem.
- Tell me.

387
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,956
I can't do Chris' makeup.

388
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,524
She refuses to acknowledge
her mustache.

389
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,923
- Is it bad?
- It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

390
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,700
Unless we convince her
to let me bleach it...

391
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,436
...Van Damme will be
making out with Gabe Kaplan.

392
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,334
I'll talk to her.

393
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,569
I hate actors.

394
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:49,379
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,
I almost didn't see you.

395
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,447
Excuse me.

396
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,152
Is your name Chandler?

397
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,616
Yes, it is.

398
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:00,955
Chandler Bing.

399
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,720
Do you know me or are you
just really good at this game?

400
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,120
I'm Susie Moss.

401
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,765
Fourth grade? Glasses?

402
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,527
I carried a box of
animal crackers like a purse?

403
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:13,769
Susie Moss!

404
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,969
Right! Yeah! Wow!

405
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,137
You look...

406
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,873
Great job growing up.

407
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,446
It's nice to see you don't still
wear the cap with the mirrors on it.

408
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:29,142
I graduated fourth grade
and realized I wasn't a pimp.

409
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,246
Remember the class play?

410
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,823
You pulled up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

411
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:41,693
Yes. Back then, I used humor
as a defense mechanism.

412
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,299
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

413
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,308
What you have been
doing since childhood?

414
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,677
Well, I got a new belt.

415
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,279
I wondered!

416
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,451
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

417
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,983
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

418
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,850
I didn't know he was in
this movie. He is so hot!

419
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,522
You think?

420
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,257
The Muscles from Brussels?
Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?

421
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,792
Did you see Time Cop?

422
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,464
No. Was he any good in it?

423
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,395
Rachel, he totally changed time!

424
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,506
So why don't you go talk to him?

425
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,667
Go tell him he's cute.
What's the worst that could happen?

426
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,170
He could hear me.

427
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,449
- I'm doing it for you.
- Don't you dare! Don't!

428
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,613
Don't!

429
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,812
Tell him I cook!

430
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,385
Excuse me.

431
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,320
This is gonna sound kind of goofy...

432
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,396
...but my friend over there...

433
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,232
...who cooks, by the way...

434
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,095
She thinks you're cute.

435
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,161
You don't think I'm cute?

436
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,366
I don't know.

437
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,534
Do you think you're cute?

438
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:05,643
We're getting off the track.
I was supposed to tell you...

439
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,145
...my friend thinks you're cute.

440
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,813
What should I tell her?

441
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:14,685
You can tell her
I think her friend is cute.

442
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,345
- Makeup!
- That's me. I gotta go.

443
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:49,085
How many times must I touch you on
the arm before you ask me on a date?

444
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,030
Well, let's try one more.

445
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,824
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

446
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,430
I'll be there.

447
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,400
And if things go well,
maybe this time...

448
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,470
...I'll get to see your underwear.

449
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,877
No one was around to hear that?

450
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,555
So what'd he say?

451
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,484
What a jerk!

452
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:24,158
I kept talking about you,
and he kept asking me out.

453
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,328
Naturally, you know, I said no.

454
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,667
Thanks, anyway.

455
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,497
He just kept asking...

456
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,604
...and asking, asking, asking...

457
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,871
If you want to go out
with him, you can.

458
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,442
Sounds like a jerk to me, but

459
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,742
Jean-Claude, she said yes!
I'll see you tonight!

460
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,922
Thank you.

461
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,056
Then Jean-Claude took me
to Crossroads...

462
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,460
...and we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

463
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,829
Oh, man. She's so smokin'!

464
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,834
She's got the greatest set of

465
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,439
No guys around, huh?

466
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,813
- Does anybody need anything?
- I'll have an espresso.

467
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:19,981
I'll get it.

468
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,379
If I ask you to, you'll end up
drinking it yourself.

469
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,450
- That is so unfair.
- I know.

470
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:32,595
Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did to her with Van Damme?

471
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,593
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

472
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,095
Marcel's trainer will let me
have him for a couple of hours.

473
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,100
You're blowing me off for a monkey?

474
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,034
We can reschedule for Saturday.

475
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,039
Unless you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

476
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,879
Stick a fork in me...

477
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,011
...I am done!

478
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,713
Stick a fork what?

479
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,012
Like when you're cooking a steak.

480
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,848
I don't eat meat.

481
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,624
How do you know vegetables are done?

482
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,920
Well, you don't.
You eat them and you can tell.

483
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,893
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

484
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,429
I've met the perfect woman.

485
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,402
We're sitting on her couch,
fooling around...

486
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,143
...and then she turns to me and says:

487
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,811
"Did you ever want to do it
in an elevator?"

488
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:24,812
What did you say?

489
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,415
I believe my exact words were...

490
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,282
How do you know if you wanna do that?

491
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,591
You just know.

492
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,096
We gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

493
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:52,198
What I had planned shouldn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

494
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,443
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

495
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,171
But...

496
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,847
...here's an idea.

497
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,849
Have you ever worn women's underwear?

498
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,588
Well, yes, actually...

499
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,519
...but they were my Aunt Edna's.

500
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,432
And there were three of us in there.

501
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,828
I was thinking
it would be kind of sexy...

502
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,198
...if you wore mine tonight
at dinner.

503
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,040
You want me to wear your panties?

504
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,578
Could you?

505
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,676
If I was wearing your underwear...

506
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,816
...then what would you be wearing?

507
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,228
You're swell!

508
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,236
Got the music, got the dinner.

509
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,429
I made Marcel's favorite dish,
banana cake...

510
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,630
...with mealworm.

511
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,014
Candle.

512
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,013
What do you think's
gonna happen here tonight?

513
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,419
Hi, are you on your way over

514
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,362
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

515
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,965
It's no big deal.

516
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:32,232
It's not like I had
anything special planned.

517
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,231
- You feel that?
- What?

518
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,858
We passed moment we
should stop holding hands.

519
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,337
Rachel, why don't you
start talking first?

520
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,203
I feel that this is
totally unjustified.

521
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,539
She gave me the green light,
I did nothing

522
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,513
Do you think I can't
see you in the TV set?

523
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,023
If there's something
you'd like to share

524
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,851
You had no right to go out with him!

525
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,132
- That's the most ridiculous
- You sold me out!

526
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,231
- I did not!
- You absolutely

527
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,402
Would you let me talk!

528
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,034
Did you just flick me?

529
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,576
Well, you wouldn't let me
finish and I was

530
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,912
That hurt!

531
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,542
Quit flicking!

532
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,818
Stop flicking!

533
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,679
You flicked me first!

534
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,591
Let's not do this!

535
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,099
Happy thoughts!

536
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,771
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

537
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,551
All right. Now, I will
let go if you both stop.

538
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,756
You want me to stop seeing him?

539
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,361
You want me to just tell him
you're seeing him instead?

540
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,657
Is that what you want?

541
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,835
That's what you want?

542
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,636
- Fine!
- Fine!

543
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,274
There we go.

544
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:52,108
If we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

545
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,854
Thanks for letting me tag along.

546
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,387
Forget about it.

547
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,459
How you doing there, squirmy?

548
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,489
I'm hanging in.

549
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,227
And a little out.

550
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,268
So assistant to the director?

551
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:20,408
That's an exciting job. You must
have a ton of responsibilities

552
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,078
I don't do the casting.

553
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,213
So what are you guys gonna eat?

554
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:30,213
How come all I can think about is
putting that ice in my mouth...

555
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:33,321
...and licking you all over?

556
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:39,355
Because I went to an all-boys high
school, and God is making up for it?

557
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,139
I want you right here...

558
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,966
...right now.

559
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,837
Right now, right here?

560
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,872
Don't you think we're in
kind of a public place?

561
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,484
They do have the shrimp.

562
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,146
Meet me in the bathroom.

563
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,528
I'm going to the bathroom now.

564
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,446
Come on.

565
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,055
All right, mister.

566
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,493
Let's see those panties.

567
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,185
Alrighty.

568
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,165
But you know what
would be even sexier?

569
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,369
What?

570
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,939
If you didn't have
your shirt tucked into them.

571
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:05,205
All right. Now, I would like
to see you wearing nothing but them.

572
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,713
Take your clothes off.

573
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:12,455
I hope you realize this means
we'll miss hearing about the specials.

574
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,256
Come on, hurry!

575
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,393
Do you want this done quick
or done right?

576
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,365
All right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

577
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:27,464
Somebody's been doing
his Buns of Steel video.

578
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:31,265
So you want me
to clench anything or...?

579
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,510
Susie?

580
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,675
This is for the fourth grade.

581
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,019
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

582
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,246
What do I mean?!

583
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,085
I mean underpants, mister!
That's what I mean!

584
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,728
What? What do you mean?

585
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,089
My skirt...

586
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,198
...you lifted. IKids laughing!

587
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,935
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!

588
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,270
That was in fourth grade!
How could you still be upset?

589
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,879
Call me in 20 years and tell me
if you're still upset about this.

590
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,421
I hope you realize you're not
getting these underpants back!

591
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,128
I can't believe this.

592
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,668
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching Sudden Death...

593
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,204
...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

594
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,304
Can you beat up that guy?

595
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,514
- Can you beat up that guy?
- Sure.

596
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,773
This is so wild.

597
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:52,288
I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a blind date.

598
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,453
Normally, I would not do it.

599
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,894
What made you make
the exception for me?

600
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,187
Rachel told me...

601
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:04,229
...you were dying to have a threesome
with me and Drew Barrymore.

602
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,596
By the way, Drew has
some ground rules and...

603
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,932
Say you're sorry!

604
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:14,778
Say it!

605
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,909
No! I'm not gonna!

606
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,016
Say it! Say it!
Great!

607
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,221
Say you're sorry
or your sweater gets it.

608
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,919
That is my favorite sweater!
That is my third-date sweater!

609
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,030
Say you're sorry.

610
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,835
You wanna play?
Okay, let's play.

611
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,125
Let's play.

612
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,942
What'll you do?

613
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:50,009
Give me back my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

614
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,546
You don't have the guts.

615
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:59,083
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken
to tell some guy he was cute.

616
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,393
Stop! Stop the madness!

617
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,630
This is crazy!

618
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,843
Who can remember why
you're fighting in the first place?

619
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,911
Yes, that's right.

620
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,913
But still...

621
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,617
Look at your purse!

622
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,924
Look at your sweater!

623
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,859
Look at yourselves!

624
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,324
I'll help you fix your sweater.

625
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,033
I'll help you...

626
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,032
...throw out your purse.

627
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,970
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

628
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,971
I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you liked him.

629
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,853
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

630
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,540
Joey?

631
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:26,708
Ma?

632
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,147
What are you doing here?
I thought you guys took off.

633
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,352
She took off with my clothes!

634
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,784
- Are you naked in there?
- Well, not exactly.

635
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,458
I'm wearing panties.

636
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,734
You always wear panties?

637
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,930
No, no. This is the first time.

638
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,509
Talk about your bad luck!

639
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,709
The first time you try panties and
someone walks off with your clothes.

640
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:10,385
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

641
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:11,983
Let me see!

642
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,759
No! I'm not letting you
or anybody else see, ever!

643
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,687
All right, all right!

644
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,192
Someone's flossing!

645
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,542
Joey, some people don't like that.

646
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,073
Chandler's wearing panties.

647
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:38,381
What?

648
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,851
- Let me see!
- You don't have to see!

649
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,610
Hi, tushy!

650
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,688
One of you give me your underpants.

651
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,958
I'm not wearing any.

652
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,394
How can you not be wearing any?

653
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:59,601
I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot pink thong.

654
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:04,664
Look, Ross. I'll give you
$50 for your underpants.

655
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,527
- Can I have the milk?
- I'm almost done with it.

656
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,430
Keep your panties on.

657
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,075
And I'm in the movie!

658
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,715
- What happened?
- A virus victim called in sick...

659
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:52,081
...so Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney!

660
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,492
Marcel just finished his last scene,
if you wanna go say goodbye.

661
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:03,090
That's okay. He's probably
got parties to go to and stuff.

662
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,938
He's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

663
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:11,771
Oh, my God!

664
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,472
What?

665
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,342
Looks like we made it

666
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,454
Left each other on the way...

667
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,348
...to another love

668
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,259
Looks like we made it

669
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,492
Or I thought so, till today

670
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:43,466
Until you were there, everywhere

671
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:48,908
And all I could taste was
Love the way we made it

672
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,482
Looks like we made it

673
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:05,484
I'm sorry. It has work between
you and me. Or you and me.

674
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,897
Drew was very disapoited.

675
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,942
Well, bye for me too.

676
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,488
Okay, we will bye-bye again.

677
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,793
Perhaps the three of us. Just...

678
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,536
Are you sure, I can
crush longer with my butt.

679
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:50,540
No, no, no...
Impressive but no.

680
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,784
Bye, Marcel!

681
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,486
See you on the big screen.

682
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,490
You keep people drinking that beer.

683
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,493
I will miss you buddy.

684
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,917
I think I want to write
a song about all this.

685
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,911
Except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

686
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,125
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

687
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,794
- How long you been waiting to
say that? - About 20 minutes!

688
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,797
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

689
00:47:58,976 --> 00:47:59,908
Cut!

690
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,112
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

691
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,243
Cut!

692
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:12,143
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

693
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,751
Mommy!

694
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,924
Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!
