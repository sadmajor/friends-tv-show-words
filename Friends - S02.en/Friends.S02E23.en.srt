1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,188
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.

2
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:10,965
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...

3
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:12,410
Give it to me.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,547
No.

5
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,647
Give it to me!

6
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:17,847
Ok, you can have it.

7
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:28,212
There you go, enjoy your coffee.

8
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:32,207
That was there when I got here.

9
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:37,005
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.

10
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,368
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.

11
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:42,687
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.

12
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:44,652
You went out with a guy in the Navy?

13
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:51,063
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.

14
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:53,060
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,861
No.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,973
No, he is my submaring guy.   
He resurfaces like every couple years

17
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:03,105
and we have the most amazing three days together.

18
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:08,492
Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.

19
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:12,749
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?

20
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:19,228
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

21
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:23,249
Hiii.

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,631
Oh no, what happened?

23
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,412
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.

24
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:28,849
Oh no.

25
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:32,111
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.

26
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:33,602
Well I've had it.
Yeah, I've had it.

27
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:34,892
Had it.
Had it.

28
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:41,266
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!

29
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:35,695
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that.

30
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:37,483
This isn't camp.

31
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:41,730
Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for.

32
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:48,488
Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.

33
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:01,054
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question.

34
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:06,814
Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?

35
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:11,442
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.

36
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,414
What're you doing?

37
00:03:14,414 --> 00:03:19,373
Just waiting for you sweetie.

38
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:22,212
Are you remaking the bed?

39
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:25,529
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.

40
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:28,209
Then, you're redoing it because...

41
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,817
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

42
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:34,166
You're pretty much running that risk either way.

43
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,620
Ok, you see,

44
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,020
the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.

45
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,814
Oh, well that's not so crazy.
I'm just easing you in.

46
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:48,090
Oh, alright.

47
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,170
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down,

48
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,227
because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be.

49
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:03,443
You don't love me any more do you.

50
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,131
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.

51
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:08,694
Really?

52
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:16,265
Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.

53
00:04:19,564 --> 00:04:24,385
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.

54
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:26,628
But don't you need experience for a job like that?

55
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:30,964
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing,

56
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:36,287
hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.

57
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:38,851
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.

58
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,815
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni.

59
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:45,132
Joey is a uh, fellow processor.

60
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,665
No kidding!

61
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:51,226
Oh yeah yeah. I process.

62
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:54,741
People want the processing, I'm the one they call.

63
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:56,431
Where do you work?

64
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:58,486
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things.

65
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:04,536
You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.

66
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:07,009
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.

67
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:12,644
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...

68
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:18,421
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?

69
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:25,962
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.

70
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,500
You look fabulous honey, you really do.

71
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,989
Yeah? Are you sure, really.

72
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:36,300
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.

73
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,586
I, I, I'm hideous.

74
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:43,056
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water.

75
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:47,848
He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.

76
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:00,709
Come in.

77
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:06,709
Hey baby, I'm back...   
Hey Ryan, what's up?

78
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,013
What's goin' on?

79
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:14,692
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.

80
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:17,148
Chicken or small?

81
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:21,938
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.

82
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:26,451
Why aren't you at home in bed?
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox.

83
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:31,043
Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.

84
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:34,011
I'm sorry, I never had 'em. 
Ohh, ohh.

85
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:40,413
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox.

86
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:43,807
I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.

87
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:47,410
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.

88
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,610
Can I please see your face?

89
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,818
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.

90
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:55,302
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.

91
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:58,963
And you hate fish. Oh.

92
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:05,054
That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see.

93
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:07,649
This is me...

94
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,497
Oh, I am scary.

95
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:17,734
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence.

96
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:20,100
You look lovely, lovely.

97
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,731
I hate this.

98
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:24,969
'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us,

99
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:30,053
and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.

100
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:35,301
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men,

101
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,819
thinking about this moment.

102
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:44,130
I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.

103
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:54,092
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.

104
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:00,728
Hey.  
Hey, how's the first day goin'?

105
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:05,543
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.

106
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:06,711
Well there you go.

107
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:11,271
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.

108
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,988
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?

109
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:19,102
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school.

110
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:20,734
Small world huh?

111
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,901
Weird world. Your kids?

112
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:30,452
I figure my character has kids.

113
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:34,731
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.

114
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,864
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that.

115
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:41,073
My character, Joseph the processor guy,

116
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:45,738
has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.

117
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:49,857
Ashley copies everything Brittany does.

118
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:57,851
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.

119
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:02,302
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid...

120
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:06,929
Ya know what? Just did.

121
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:13,603
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.

122
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,748
You know what makes the itching even worse?

123
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:27,262
That you don't stop talking about it.

124
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:31,588
Fine.
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok.

125
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:37,099
Here we go,

126
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:42,094
come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...

127
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:44,047
What're you doing? Are you scratching?

128
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:47,883
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.

129
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:50,658
You're scratching. Give me the dice. 
No.

130
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:53,470
Give me the dice.
No. Here. There.

131
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,408
Ooh, double sixes.

132
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:59,029
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.

133
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,885
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard.

134
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:06,059
I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.

135
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,137
No.
Give it.

136
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:09,271
No.  
Yeah, come on.

137
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:12,206
You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on.

138
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:17,494
Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.

139
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:19,209
Oh God help me.

140
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:26,066
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.

141
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:34,050
Oh,

142
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,707
stop that, stop that right now.

143
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:42,767
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.

144
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:48,966
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch,

145
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,510
you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.

146
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,166
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up.

147
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,191
Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.

148
00:10:56,191 --> 00:11:00,427
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Bye bye Joey.

149
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:04,787
What a phony.

150
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:09,831
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing.

151
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:11,582
Hey Mr. Douglas. 
Sir.

152
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:13,671
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo.

153
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:16,220
So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?

154
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,774
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.

155
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:21,729
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.

156
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:28,492
Yeah Bing, what's that about?

157
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:31,979
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale.

158
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:34,529
Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.

159
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,661
Rough numbers?

160
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:42,066
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas?

161
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:45,015
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.

162
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:47,902
Uh, if you say so sir.

163
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:51,110
Joseph's good, isn't he?

164
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,771
Well, I'm going to kill you. 
Hey, hey,

165
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:59,266
I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up.

166
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:03,135
Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.

167
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:06,205
Why?

168
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:10,580
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does,

169
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:17,828
ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.

170
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:26,390
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?

171
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,346
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.

172
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:34,963
You're strict.
It's for their own good.

173
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:39,622
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.

174
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:44,964
See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.

175
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,246
Exactly.

176
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:51,812
Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.

177
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,088
Tell me the truth.

178
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:56,413
Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?

179
00:12:56,413 --> 00:13:00,166
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.

180
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,532
Very good.
Thank you.

181
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,942
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.

182
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:07,140
You're gonna do what to my clocks.

183
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,933
I'm gonna set them to my time.

184
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:15,016
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.

185
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:20,566
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?

186
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:25,100
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.

187
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,741
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
No come on. Come on tell me.

188
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,952
No. See you don't understand.
Come on.

189
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:31,982
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.

190
00:13:31,982 --> 00:13:33,809
No that's not true. That is not true.

191
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:34,844
Oh yeah? 
Yeah.

192
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:40,371
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Ok.

193
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:52,244
Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.

194
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:56,132
What if they get mixed up?

195
00:13:56,132 --> 00:14:00,338
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.

196
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:05,345
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal.

197
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:10,254
I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

198
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:15,208
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.

199
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,992
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.

200
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:27,614
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

201
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:31,621
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.

202
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,292
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?

203
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:40,190
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it,

204
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,826
turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.

205
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:47,973
Alright, that's it. Look Joey,

206
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:51,166
I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya,

207
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,664
and if I could just fire Joseph, I would,

208
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:58,700
but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

209
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,942
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.

210
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,972
I don't, I hate Joseph,

211
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:08,586
ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.

212
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,228
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph.

213
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:14,930
You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.

214
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,470
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh,

215
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,189
I can sleep with his wife.

216
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:26,444
Karen?

217
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:29,790
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her.

218
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:36,022
Oh, you know what? I just did.

219
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:38,021
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.

220
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:43,898
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy.

221
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:45,389
Yeah the rogue processor

222
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:49,427
who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler.

223
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:52,897
In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.

224
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:53,451
Really?

225
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,830
No freakshow, she's fictional.

226
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:03,414
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.

227
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:06,174
Thank you.

228
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:10,568
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph.

229
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:16,008
I liked him. His wife, she was hot.

230
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:21,570
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.

231
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,654
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.

232
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:28,973
Well that wasn't easy.

233
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:31,536
Ok, dinner's on.

234
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:39,527
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.

235
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:42,611
Alright you kids, bye now.
Bye.

236
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:47,226
Oh look, a low budget puppet show.

237
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:51,648
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.

238
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:57,273
Wine? 
Please.

239
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:09,332
Oh, I spilled some.
I got it.

240
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:22,088
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.

241
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:24,749
What?

242
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:28,694
Sorry.

243
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:32,490
You look beautiful. 
Oh.

244
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:49,189
You know what, that's it, that's it.

245
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:19,775
Monica, wake up. Monica.

246
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,852
What's up?

247
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:24,541
I thought of a thing.

248
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,053
Yeah?

249
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:34,932
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.

250
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:42,929
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.

251
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,647
Or so I would have you believe.

252
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,049
No. Big deal,

253
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:52,668
so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.

254
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,507
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.

255
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:58,534
Alright, go on. 
Ok,

256
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:06,004
I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise

257
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:13,726
the ocean would be on the wrong side.

258
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:16,286
Oh my God, you're a freak.

259
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:20,932
Yeah. How 'bout that.

260
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,950
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
I really can't say.

261
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,841
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
I can't say.

262
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:35,921
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

263
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:39,495
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.

264
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:41,363
I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.

265
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:45,032
Ok, I'll walk you out.
Bye Ryan. 
Pleasure.
It was nice to meet you. 
Take care.

266
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:55,682
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?

267
00:19:55,682 --> 00:19:57,767
You like that do ya?

268
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,013
Oh yeah.

269
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:01,309
I'll make some calls.
Ok.

270
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,686
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?

271
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:07,420
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned,

272
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,891
like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk.

273
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:15,251
Oh I just got that.

274
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:24,411
Taxi!

275
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:32,269
Bye you.

276
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:48,781
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-...

277
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:53,340
Hey sailor. 
Is this what you had in mind?

278
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,094
I'll say.

279
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,285
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

280
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:05,771
Well then uh,

281
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:09,104
we better make this night count.

282
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,866
Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine.

283
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:23,384
Anchors away.

284
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:29,608
Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse.

285
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,017
Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

286
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:42,204
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
