1
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:04,755
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:08,285
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.

3
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:09,331
Who?

4
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:14,717
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. 
Wow!

5
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:20,925
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.

6
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:23,627
'Cause he was just so darn cute.

7
00:00:23,627 --> 00:00:27,993
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.

8
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:33,439
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.

9
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:38,520
Or you just do it.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,317
I did do it, I'm a professional.

11
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:41,361
Then what's the problem?

12
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:44,523
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says

13
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:46,750
'good actor, bad kisser'.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,920
Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like,

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,911
like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.

16
00:00:55,911 --> 00:01:02,108
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.

17
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:54,843
Hey, what did your agent say?

18
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:59,479
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.

19
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,268
Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay,

20
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:05,267
one of you girls come over here and kiss me.

21
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:07,234
What, forget it!
Yeah, right.

22
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:09,419
Come on, I need your help here.

23
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,189
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.

24
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:15,593
You see this, this is a friend.

25
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,674
Uh-huh, let's go.

26
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:20,223
Oh, wait I have gum.

27
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,471
Okay.

28
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,370
Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.

29
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,797
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?

30
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:42,247
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little,

31
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,320
maybe that's what you need to work on.

32
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,306
Yeah, that makes sense.

33
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:56,352
Over my dead body!

34
00:02:56,352 --> 00:03:00,067
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.

35
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:06,408
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!

36
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:10,033
Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.

37
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:18,321
Oh my God,

38
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:21,590
you look so good!

39
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:29,744
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.

40
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:31,151
So don't,

41
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:35,004
I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.

42
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:37,230
Because I promised Mindy I would.

43
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,080
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.

44
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,284
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what

45
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:51,199
I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.

46
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,752
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?

47
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:06,314
I may have.
Woo-hoo, stuud!

48
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,502
What's she look like?

49
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:12,073
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.

50
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:14,590
Woo-hoo, geeek!

51
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,522
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl,

52
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:21,071
you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...

53
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:23,648
Get out!
Nooo! 
Please!

54
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:28,427
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real',

55
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:31,480
and I did.

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,557
Wow! What's that like?

57
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:39,322
It's like this, me, no jokes.

58
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:42,989
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.

59
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:46,845
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.

60
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:50,477
Bye, Richard.

61
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:53,520
Bye sweetie, I love you.
I love you, too.

62
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:03,478
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy,

63
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:07,115
I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.

64
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:09,635
What are you talking about? What wedding?

65
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:11,507
Come on, like you never talk that.

66
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:16,119
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment.

67
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:20,052
God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'

68
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,274
Afraid to ask him?
Could not be more terrified.

69
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:26,151
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing,

70
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:30,634
give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.

71
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,590
Where's Benny?
There he is!

72
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,991
Where's Benny,
there he is.

73
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:49,110
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.

74
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:53,845
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.

75
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,112
Okay.

76
00:05:56,112 --> 00:06:00,447
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?

77
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,631
Sure I do.

78
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,641
Yeah, am I in it?

79
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:08,157
Honey, you are in it.

80
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:13,087
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
Oh, yeah!

81
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:18,790
Keep talkin'.

82
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,744
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice,

83
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:28,755
we could move to France, make French toast.

84
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:37,116
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast.

85
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:39,875
Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?

86
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,882
Like a hound?

87
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:48,679
Not a basset, a bassinet.

88
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,949
You really need the bassinet?

89
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,431
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.

90
00:06:57,103 --> 00:07:01,882
Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future. 
Oh, hey.

91
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:05,902
I love children, I have children.

92
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:07,637
I just don't want to be 70

93
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:13,070
when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.

94
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,116
Look I want you,
now.

95
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:24,045
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now.

96
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:28,189
Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future,

97
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:33,351
I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.

98
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:39,352
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much.

99
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:42,068
Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.

100
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:45,969
Joey, no means no!

101
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:49,111
Hey!

102
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:56,194
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.

103
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:59,267
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute

104
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:03,280
And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon

105
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,068
Get away from me I said no!

106
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,439
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.

107
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,077
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him

108
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:19,471
Bye.
Bye, good luck.

109
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:24,071
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that?

110
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:27,002
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum.

111
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:33,024
See, she likes art, and I like funny words.

112
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:35,766
What does she mean by HH?

113
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,680
It means we're holding hands.

114
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,438
Are you the cutest?
I'm afraid I might just be.

115
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:49,472
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person

116
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:54,690
and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads,

117
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,331
or. It could be a guy.

118
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,464
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.

119
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:05,315
It could be like a big giant guy.

120
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:10,834
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back.

121
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:11,950
What's going on?

122
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,801
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

123
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:19,788
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.

124
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:25,873
How do you not fall down more?

125
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:29,709
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'

126
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,802
All right.

127
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:40,475
"My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!

128
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:44,281
Well at least we know she's a woman.

129
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,891
I can't believe she's married.

130
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:50,482
Aw, man I'm sorry.

131
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:54,078
This must be very tough for ya, huh.

132
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:58,572
So, I read this article in the paper the other day

133
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:03,960
that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.

134
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,685
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.

135
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:12,432
See, we're having fun.
Oh, absolutely.

136
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:15,474
Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.

137
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:17,761
Neither am I.

138
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:18,987
Hey, there.
Hi.

139
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:20,802
Are you all right?

140
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:24,792
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding,

141
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,917
and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't,

142
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:32,024
people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.

143
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:34,713
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding,

144
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:38,398
generally people focus on the bride.
God I know, you're right.

145
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:42,527
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time.

146
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:47,039
Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.

147
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,745
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
Okay, good luck

148
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,588
Thank you,

149
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:54,785
Okay, Okay.

150
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:03,838
Why the hell didn't you tell me!

151
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:08,706
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'

152
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:12,189
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops

153
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:17,452
that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school.

154
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:22,014
I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.

155
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,231
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.

156
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:29,242
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.

157
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:30,864
Rachel!

158
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:33,090
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.

159
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:38,926
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.

160
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:45,227
You told me you didn't see anything.
I tell ya a lot things!

161
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:50,994
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Stay well.

162
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:55,473
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.

163
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:58,037
Rach! Rach!
Oh, hi!

164
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:00,913
Oh my God, I'm married!
I know.

165
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:04,008
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.

166
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:06,204
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.

167
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:08,169
Min.

168
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,996
Oh Rach, you're still here,

169
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,868
at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.

170
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:16,867
Yeah, I love that story.

171
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:22,032
Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?

172
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,718
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding,

173
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:30,030
Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.

174
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,391
Insane!

175
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:36,144
...from the syphilis.
What?!

176
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:39,918
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.

177
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:47,351
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight?

178
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:51,166
I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....

179
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:55,437
Hello? Hello?

180
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:07,325
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent.

181
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:08,592
She wants to know what's wrong?

182
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:13,009
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.

183
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:15,772
Oh, my.

184
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:16,753
What?

185
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:18,709
She wants to meet you in person.

186
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:21,154
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too,

187
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:23,590
okay, but she's married, she has a husband.

188
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,690
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy.

189
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,802
I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now,

190
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:37,146
you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.

191
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,158
Okay, I'll do it!

192
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:44,392
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her!

193
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:48,196
Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww.

194
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:51,111
No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first.

195
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:55,399
No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.

196
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:01,889
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.

197
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,395
Okay, last chance.

198
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:13,513
Again, I'm sorry.

199
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:18,837
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.

200
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:22,721
You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society,

201
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:28,647
and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I...

202
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,259
I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.

203
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:43,410
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here.

204
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,836
Thank you.

205
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:51,876
I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
What?!

206
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,600
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech.

207
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,961
Thank you, thank you very much.

208
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:03,796
Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together.

209
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:05,489
And Rachel...

210
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,811
What.

211
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:08,639
No, no, no now in all seriousness,

212
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,786
its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight,

213
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:16,962
and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!

214
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,190
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...

215
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,643
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?

216
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:31,505
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

217
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:33,709
Oh dear God.

218
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:42,792
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.

219
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:48,747
And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.

220
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:53,522
What are you doing I'm serious.

221
00:15:54,118 --> 00:16:00,869
Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him,

222
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:04,909
which incidentally worked out pretty well for me

223
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:13,010
Cheers!

224
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,637
She you in the parking lot.
No, Rach!

225
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:24,513
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?

226
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:40,386
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave.

227
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:42,750
I probably should, but I'm not,

228
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,158
see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings.

229
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:54,586
See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening

230
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:58,928
with a little bit of grace and dignity.

231
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:03,795
Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.

232
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:12,192
There's nothing really left to say except....

233
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:24,249
"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl.

234
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:31,711
With yellow feathers, feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there.

235
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:33,873
She would..."

236
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:37,004
Marenge,
"...marenge, thank you honey,

237
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:43,502
and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."

238
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:46,198
Everybody!

239
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:53,076
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana.

240
00:17:53,076 --> 00:18:02,791
At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....

241
00:18:07,683 --> 00:18:11,044
Okay, I'll do it.

242
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:12,120
You'll do what?

243
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,125
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.

244
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,800
Oh my God!

245
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,511
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again,

246
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:24,512
I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings,

247
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:27,153
I'll coach the soccer team.

248
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:30,656
Really?
Yeah, if I have to.

249
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:34,478
Monica,

250
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:44,436
I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.

251
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:49,040
You're the most wonderful man.

252
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:56,006
And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times,

253
00:18:56,006 --> 00:19:00,273
then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'

254
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:04,166
But you're not.

255
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:12,559
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.

256
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,624
I wanna have a baby,

257
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:24,887
but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.

258
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,746
God. I love you.

259
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,399
I know you do.

260
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,119
Me too.

261
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:53,101
So what now?

262
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:59,423
I guess we just keep dancing.

263
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:14,390
Where is she, Where is she?

264
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,532
Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?

265
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:20,357
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.

266
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:24,107
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.

267
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:27,549
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.

268
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,426
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot,

269
00:20:31,426 --> 00:20:35,356
you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil.

270
00:20:35,356 --> 00:20:39,152
I think what you have to do is try not to...

271
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,466
Oh my God!

272
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,909
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!

273
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:06,822
OH.....MY.....GOD!!

274
00:21:14,312 --> 00:21:19,041
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend,

275
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,883
and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.

276
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:30,834
Wow, you are a good friend,

277
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:34,965
'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.

278
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:41,182
But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
