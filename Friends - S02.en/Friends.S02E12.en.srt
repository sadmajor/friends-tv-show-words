1
00:00:08,146 --> 00:00:11,629
Can't get the monkey off your back?

2
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:19,042
Then put it in your mouth....With MonkeyShine Beer.

3
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:29,128
MonkeyShine Beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there.

4
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:31,485
That commercial always makes me so sad.

5
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:37,051
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.

6
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,108
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.

7
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:46,404
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.

8
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:49,154
And the fact that they're both monkeys.

9
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:52,430
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.

10
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,512
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight.

11
00:00:56,512 --> 00:01:02,848
I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

12
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:09,186
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.

13
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:14,192
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . .

14
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:17,345
all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
F r i e n d s
Season 212.The One After the Superbowl I

16
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:07,477
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.

17
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:09,711
Rhythm?

18
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:11,753
No, my first fan mail.

19
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:13,639
Alright!

20
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,555
'Dear Dr. Remore,..

21
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:19,074
know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh.

22
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:22,919
'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.'

23
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,345
Ooh wait,

24
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:29,568
'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'

25
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:35,512
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.

26
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:39,114
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment.

27
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:41,633
There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.

28
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:47,728
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.

29
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:48,838
Hey guys.

30
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:50,189
Hey.

31
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,036
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?

32
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:55,230
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A.

33
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,559
so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

34
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:03,684
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh,

35
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,111
you know, isn't capable of that emotion.

36
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:12,690
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.

37
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,985
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh,

38
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:19,099
now.

39
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,122
I know, I know.

40
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:25,886
Hello.

41
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:28,128
- Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.(Rob:Chris Isaac)
- Hi Rob Dohnen.

42
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,228
- I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
- Oh, wow.

43
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:39,443
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking,

44
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:43,648
have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?

45
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:47,077
Oh, I would love to have kids. . .

46
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:53,873
you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.

47
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,563
- Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
- Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.

48
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:06,430
- Hello.
- It's Erica.

49
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,039
Ah, the stalker.

50
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,873
Never mind, it's open.

51
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:14,121
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea.

52
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:18,754
We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.

53
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,045
Let's get out of here.

54
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:27,292
The one time they're not home.

55
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:33,191
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.

56
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:37,608
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.

57
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:40,359
She's comin'.

58
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:46,710
It's me.

59
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,125
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die.

60
00:04:50,712 --> 00:04:53,150
- Ready?
- Wait, wait, wait.

61
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,157
Ok.

62
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,038
- Hi.(Erica:Brooke Shields)
- Erica.

63
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:14,084
- Mr. Geller?
- Hi.

64
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:18,954
Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.

65
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:22,509
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year.

66
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,550
He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.

67
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,757
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.

68
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,648
Oh my God, what happened?

69
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:40,671
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better

70
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:43,391
but then he died.

71
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:46,034
I can't believe this.

72
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:50,948
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying,

73
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:54,325
'Sometimes monkeys die.'

74
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,640
It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.

75
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,394
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.

76
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:10,282
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.

77
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,123
Zoo dollars?

78
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:17,447
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats.

79
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:21,675
Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.

80
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:28,728
- Ooohhh.
- I know.

81
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:34,622
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.

82
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:37,075
- Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:41,110
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.

84
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,526
And she's not crazy?

85
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:45,828
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job.

86
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:49,713
Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.

87
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,523
Oh my God.

88
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:55,525
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.

89
00:06:55,525 --> 00:07:01,515
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person.

90
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:05,628
I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love?

91
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:10,560
What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.

92
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,268
You OK?

93
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:18,042
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.

94
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:22,594
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.

95
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:29,116
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups.

96
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:33,306
Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing,

97
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:35,564
ya know, and kids listen.

98
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:39,556
This is a huge responsibility. What?

99
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:42,641
Are you gonna kiss me?

100
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:46,207
- I was thinkin' about it.
- OK.

101
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:52,031
OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes.

102
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,088
- Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe.
- Hi Phoebe.

103
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:00,508
OK, um,

104
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:04,589
I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK.

105
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:12,812
Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes,
she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike.

106
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:20,347
But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner,
And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner.

107
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:24,537
Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru,

108
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,196
but the truth is she died and some day you will too.
La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...

109
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:42,104
- Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
- Yeah it is. . .

110
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,232
what?

111
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,971
Well, here we sit, devil may care,

112
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:51,367
just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.

113
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,035
Yeah, that was a tricky one.

114
00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:00,437
In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.

115
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:03,651
Who's they?

116
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:06,794
No one.

117
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:11,029
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands.

118
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,079
Oh these hands, these beautiful hands,

119
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,649
oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.

120
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,828
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.

121
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,995
No, seriously.

122
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:32,807
These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands.

123
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:37,771
Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?

124
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:41,123
Alright, just one.

125
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,874
Wow, you're good at that.

126
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:57,025
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?

127
00:09:57,025 --> 00:10:04,056
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.

128
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:21,270
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.

129
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:27,604
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way.

130
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:31,869
But, um, zoo dollars?

131
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:36,993
It's about your monkey. It's alive.

132
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:44,149
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?

133
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:56,269
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage.

134
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,011
Alright, look, I got to tell you something.

135
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:03,983
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me.

136
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:06,987
Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?

137
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:07,558
But that's what...

138
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:10,512
- I should just be happy to be near you.
- Hey I-

139
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:15,788
Hey what?

140
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:23,265
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.

141
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:37,823
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people
just to make them like you... But don't.

142
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:42,688
Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody!

143
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:48,359
That's another thing that you don't wanna do.

144
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,486
- Excellent!
- Very informative!

145
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:53,230
Not at all inappropriate!

146
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,602
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.

147
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,438
That was great, the kids loved you.

148
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,690
Yay, I rock.

149
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,030
And you know why? Because you told the truth,

150
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:13,166
and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.

151
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,632
But.

152
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:16,529
How did you know there was a but?

153
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:21,673
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.

154
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:29,150
The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.

155
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,559
I can do that.

156
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,650
- Really?
- Yeah.

157
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,990
Because that would be fantastic.

158
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,154
What? You wanna kiss me?

159
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:40,335
Thinkin' about it.

160
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:46,599
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness,

161
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:54,968
flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.

162
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:59,917
- Buddy, my monkey?
- Oh, yeah, right.

163
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:04,169
There was a break-in, few months back, inside job.

164
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,675
Your monkey was taken.

165
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:08,330
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.

166
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:14,442
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?

167
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:18,233
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.

168
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:23,361
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up.

169
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:27,792
Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?

170
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,433
That guy Lipson?

171
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:35,153
Lipson knows. Hmm, Lipson knows huh?

172
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:37,240
Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum,

173
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,090
enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...

174
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,030
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.

175
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:48,077
Word on the street - well,

176
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,750
when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.

177
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,827
Of course.

178
00:13:54,827 --> 00:14:01,709
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.

179
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,594
This is unbelievable.

180
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,161
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?

181
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:11,954
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?

182
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:14,611
Maybe.

183
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:17,831
But you already told me everything.

184
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:28,555
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.

185
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:30,469
Well, so what're you gonna do?

186
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,587
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.

187
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:36,948
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.

188
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:42,527
- OK, hi again.
- Hi Phoebe.

189
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:48,190
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.

190
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,548
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo,
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo.

191
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:58,051
Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up,
And that's how we get hamburgers.

192
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:04,326
Nooowww, chickens!

193
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:06,153
You're the only one who can save her Drake.

194
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:09,225
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.

195
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,863
Well, there goes my whole belief system.

196
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:15,560
It's Erica.

197
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,716
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.

198
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,626
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.

199
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,072
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.

200
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:23,426
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?

201
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:27,546
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.

202
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,835
Hey Erica, c'mon in.

203
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:36,013
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?

204
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:40,390
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?

205
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,800
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?

206
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,475
Who?

207
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:46,997
Sabrina. I know about you two.

208
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:50,640
I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.

209
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:52,987
It's not what you think, that was...

210
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:55,715
You told me I was the only one.

211
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:03,352
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright.

212
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:07,806
Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK.

213
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:11,670
I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.

214
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,591
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?

215
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,433
Somebody wanna help me out here?

216
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:23,155
Oh, I know, I know.

217
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:24,590
Where am I?

218
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:30,315
University hospital.

219
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:32,349
How, how can you be here and there.

220
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:34,647
'Cause it's a television show.

221
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:38,433
Drake, what're you getting at?

222
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,159
I'm not Drake.

223
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,598
That's right, he's not Drake,

224
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:47,609
he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.

225
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:52,987
Is this true?

226
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:55,833
Yes, yes it is true.

227
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:02,331
And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.

228
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,317
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.

229
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:17,252
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.

230
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:23,592
Is all this true?

231
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:31,875
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica.

232
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:36,236
You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with.

233
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:40,808
Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.

234
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:42,565
Oh Hans.

235
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:48,512
Hans...Hans...

236
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:50,922
Yo evil twin.

237
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:54,846
Right. Goodbye Erica,

238
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:57,671
good luck in Salem.

239
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:59,590
Take care

240
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,365
I'll never forget you Hans.

241
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:09,945
- OK, alright, the people who threw the water.

242
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:13,072
Fired! Why?

243
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:18,328
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.

244
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:24,220
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?

245
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,066
No.

246
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,276
I see.

247
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:33,032
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.

248
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:40,988
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?

249
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:44,671
- I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
- Who's Barney.

250
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,828
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy,

251
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:56,988
and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.

252
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,527
You're kidding.

253
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,209
- This is amazing.
- I know.

254
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:04,465
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.

255
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,122
- OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
- OK.

256
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,393
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?

257
00:19:15,393 --> 00:19:18,032
Um, yeah I guess that's me.

258
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:21,048
She's here.

259
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:34,044
Sometimes men love women,
sometimes men love men,

260
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:41,308
and then there are bisexuals,
though some just say they're kidding themselves.
la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...

261
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:52,122
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.

262
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:55,389
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please.

263
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:59,573
I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?

264
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,390
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

265
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,286
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?

266
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:09,125
- I'm sorry guys, closed set.
- Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand,

267
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,161
I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.

268
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:16,878
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.

269
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:19,831
Ross, there he is.

270
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:24,723
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel.

271
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:38,050
In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight.

272
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:46,415
In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight.

273
00:20:46,415 --> 00:21:00,000
a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
