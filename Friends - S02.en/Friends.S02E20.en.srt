1
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:08,351
Hey. Watcha guys doin?

2
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:12,851
Monica's making us watch "Old Yeller".

3
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:17,168
Why are you guys so upset? It's "Old Yeller", it's a happy movie.

4
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:18,787
- What?
- What're you talkin' about?

5
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:23,755
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.

6
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:26,272
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?

7
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:29,712
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?

8
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:31,991
- That's not the end.
- Yu-huh.

9
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:36,363
That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.

10
00:00:36,363 --> 00:00:38,589
What about the part where he has rabies?

11
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:42,679
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies.

12
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,390
That's what my mom said.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,509
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.

14
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:53,838
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before.

15
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:58,647
Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun?

16
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:02,563
Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun.

17
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,676
No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller,

18
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:08,993
no, no no, the end, THE END.

19
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:14,789
이런 개같은 영화가 어딨어!

20
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:23,789
F r i e n d s
Season 220. The One Where Old Yeller Dies

21
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,347
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers...

22
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:08,891
Chicken and potatoes...

23
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:11,766
What am I wearing?...

24
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:14,245
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,914
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.

26
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:26,316
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.

27
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:29,489
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?

28
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:32,308
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.

29
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:35,907
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym,

30
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:38,237
and no I don't look.

31
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:42,388
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.

32
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:47,111
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues

33
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:49,121
and Dan with the poking.

34
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:53,473
'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'

35
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,226
Ok. Hey,

36
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:59,271
why don't you ask Richard?

37
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:04,819
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game

38
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:13,246
and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?

39
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:20,711
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.

40
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,554
Ok, that's Eric.

41
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:27,113
Glad to be of help. Matches.

42
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:30,018
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game?

43
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,748
What?

44
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:34,714
I don't know.

45
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:40,154
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.

46
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:43,473
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well,

47
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:48,002
ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old

48
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:54,956
-er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.

49
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:59,193
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me.

50
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:03,709
Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.

51
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:12,374
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?

52
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:15,465
- Ok, this could be tough.
- Ok ok ok ok.

53
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:21,515
Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,032
Ooh, you almost had it.

55
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:33,153
No no, you're fine, you're fine.

56
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:35,435
- Hello
- Hi. 
- Hey.

57
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:36,685
Hi honey.

58
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:39,552
- Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
- What? 
- What?

59
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:46,040
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up.

60
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,908
He pulled himself up. Standing man.

61
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:55,119
I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.

62
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,623
Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.

63
00:04:57,623 --> 00:05:00,525
You can watch our tape if you want.

64
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,191
I don't believe this.

65
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:04,832
I miss, I miss the first time of everything.

66
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:08,786
I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss?

67
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:12,417
Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?

68
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:15,267
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing.

69
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:20,156
He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.

70
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:22,745
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff.

71
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:27,464
Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-

72
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:31,289
Great. That would be fine.

73
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,710
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.

74
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,508
Oh shout, that would have been fun.

75
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:42,554
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved,

76
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:46,914
he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has.

77
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,123
Very good.

78
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,158
- Hey.
- Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?

79
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:57,200
Ok, 'Love Story', 'Brian's Song', and 'Terms of Endearment'.

80
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:03,648
Wow, all you need now is The 'Killing Fields' and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.

81
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:07,929
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that

82
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:10,949
my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies

83
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:17,319
to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.

84
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,089
- Hey.
- Hey. 
- Hey.

85
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,206
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?

86
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:25,029
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie.

87
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:29,114
What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.

88
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:32,200
- So'd you guys have fun?
- Your boyfriend is so cool.

89
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,394
- Really?
- Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar.

90
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,479
Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.

91
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,149
Wow, he must like you the best.

92
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:44,189
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats.

93
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:46,277
You never even saw the money, it was like this.

94
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:50,551
- Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats.
- You're welcome.

95
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:53,386
Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car.

96
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:55,812
No problem.

97
00:06:55,812 --> 00:07:00,390
- Hey Chandler.
- I think they get it. 
- Ok.

98
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,485
- There's the man.
- He-he-eyy.

99
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:06,074
Hey, you're gettin' better.

100
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:09,554
- I'm gonna keep this by the way.
- Ok.

101
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,272
He kept my dollar.

102
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,226
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?

103
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:21,504
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.

104
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:25,752
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.

105
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:29,680
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.

106
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,666
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.

107
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:37,451
- Buy mommy. 
- We love you. Buy.
- Have a good time. Ok, Ben.

108
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:40,947
- Ross.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:43,641
Look.

110
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:52,872
Joey, do you know we can see you from here?

111
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,644
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?

112
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:59,869
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.

113
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:03,116
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.

114
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:09,873
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.

115
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,920
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.

116
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,529
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.

117
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:25,713
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?

118
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,639
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache.

119
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,426
Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.

120
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:36,429
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.

121
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,065
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.

122
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,199
- You're meeting Richard?
- Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.

123
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,467
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?

124
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:45,672
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.

125
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:50,233
- You hear that? We're the guys.
- We're the guys.

126
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:52,730
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?

127
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,360
Thank you.

128
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:05,041
Hi, we're visitiing.

129
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,283
It's Ben and his da-da.

130
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:10,637
Da-da.

131
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,315
Can you say da-da?

132
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:16,558
Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.

133
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:17,511
No luck huh?

134
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:20,851
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him,

135
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:27,349
which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but...

136
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,918
Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.

137
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:33,146
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.

138
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:43,705
- What're you doing?
- Uh, I'm holding Ben.

139
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:48,243
- Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
- Ok.

140
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:50,531
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.

141
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:53,202
This is how I would hold a football.

142
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:55,550
Ok, here, here. There we go.

143
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,069
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies.

144
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:02,044
I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.

145
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:04,104
- It's alright, it's no big deal.
- Really?

146
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,895
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.

147
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,321
- What?
- What?

148
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,875
You think about stuff like that?

149
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,804
Uhh, yeah.

150
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:20,638
I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.

151
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:23,114
Two, two babies?

152
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:25,632
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl.

153
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:31,671
Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.

154
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:33,633
Then what's gonna happen?

155
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:38,647
- Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
- Uh-huh.

156
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,631
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that

157
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:44,787
we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want.

158
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:51,714
And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.

159
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:57,915
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great.

160
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,471
- Ok, wow, you know what.
- Huh?

161
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:06,218
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um,

162
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:10,068
I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee.

163
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:13,911
Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot.

164
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:17,593
Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?

165
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,674
Hey.

166
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:26,307
Hey Phoebs, what's happening?

167
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:31,943
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.

168
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:36,666
- So you watched the movies huh?
- Uh huh, what is happening to the world?

169
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:42,558
I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.

170
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:44,121
Charlotte who?

171
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:48,601
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies.

172
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:52,632
It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.

173
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:55,560
- Alright, you wanna feel better?
- Yeah.

174
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,319
Ok, here, watch this.

175
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,160
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.

176
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,689
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.

177
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:09,266
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees,

178
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:11,835
I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom,

179
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:16,094
the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.

180
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:21,718
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?

181
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:25,634
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.

182
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:29,505
- Hey, big guy, game time.
- Hey, be right there.

183
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:34,352
- There's a game?
- Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop.

184
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,889
Bring your nerves of steel.

185
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:41,353
It's the basketball playoffs.

186
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:44,372
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me,

187
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:49,269
- I mean, they have each other.
- Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry,

188
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,396
I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends,

189
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:58,231
they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'

190
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:01,078
Alright that's great, then just go.

191
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,429
- Go Knicks.
- Uh, it's the college playoffs.

192
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:07,529
- Oh, then go Vassar.
- Uh, they're not in it.

193
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,121
- Ok, then just go.
- Ok.

194
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:14,130
Oh, why does this bother me so much?

195
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,707
I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.

196
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:18,830
Sure.

197
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,985
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?

198
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:28,792
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.

199
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,956
- Aghh.
- Me too.

200
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:34,431
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.

201
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:37,045
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.

202
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:40,996
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there.

203
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:46,883
Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.

204
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:50,324
Ok, what the hell happened back there?

205
00:13:50,324 --> 00:13:54,449
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football,

206
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:58,316
the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.

207
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:00,387
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know,

208
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:04,563
I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.

209
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:08,209
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.

210
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,643
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?

211
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:13,473
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and,

212
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:15,879
and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night.

213
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,332
I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be.

214
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:22,823
You know what our childrens names are gonna be.

215
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,597
No, no,

216
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:31,355
I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.

217
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,492
What was the book?

218
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:36,437
The big book of childrens' names.

219
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:39,200
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen,

220
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,752
- what we have is amazing.
- Yeah.

221
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:43,555
But I do not want to have everything decided for me.

222
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:48,366
I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left.

223
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:50,287
I, I like not knowing right now and

224
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:53,994
I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.

225
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,798
- Ok fine.
- Thank you.

226
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,869
- We're not done.
- I didn't know that.

227
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:02,967
Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you

228
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:07,950
because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.

229
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,089
- Fine, I will.
- Good, 'cause I love you.

230
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:10,885
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

231
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:13,305
- Well I love you too.
- Well that's the first time we've said that.

232
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:14,913
- Yes it is.
- Well, I'm gonna kiss you.

233
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,806
Well you better.

234
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,326
Hey.

235
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:27,705
- Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
- Did you like it?

236
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,671
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when

237
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:32,771
um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried,

238
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:37,206
or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.

239
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:40,123
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?

240
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:44,636
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse,

241
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:49,585
it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."

242
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:54,737
Kick save and... denied.

243
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:58,287
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and...

244
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:03,829
BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?

245
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,514
- Man you are incredible.
- Well, we had a table in college.

246
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:10,945
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.

247
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:15,466
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.

248
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:22,488
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.

249
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:24,885
Ok, just one more point.

250
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,570
Score!

251
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:30,994
Now can we go?

252
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:33,942
See, that's why we don't let her play.

253
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:39,911
- Is everything all right?
- Um-hmm. 
- Uh-oh.

254
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:44,157
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.

255
00:16:44,157 --> 00:16:46,344
- Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
- Well.

256
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:52,352
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads.

257
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:56,945
I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow.

258
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:59,682
What are you kickin me for?

259
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:02,445
Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.

260
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:06,523
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?

261
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:08,429
- Oh yeah.
- No.

262
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:11,794
Nooooo.

263
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:16,227
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular.

264
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:20,269
See, when we say dad, we mean buddy.

265
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:22,229
- We mean pal.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

266
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:25,708
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad,

267
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:32,792
Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.

268
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:37,642
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening

269
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:41,515
- and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
- Nighty-nite.

270
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:44,804
- You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
- Not a dad.

271
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:47,579
I can't believe you got us into trouble.

272
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:55,394
- So are you ok?
- Yeah,

273
00:17:56,385 --> 00:18:00,501
just, I feel like I'm about a hundred.

274
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:03,428
I thought I was just one of the guys.

275
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:07,629
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys.

276
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:17,083
You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.

277
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,191
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.

278
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:23,506
Yeah, well they suck too.

279
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:28,078
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.

280
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:33,009
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.

281
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:36,604
- Hello.
- It's us.

282
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:40,187
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.

283
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,001
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben?

284
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:47,192
Yes we can, yes we can.

285
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:52,991
There. I did it. I did it.

286
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:55,233
Look at that,

287
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:58,552
oh, stays on and everything. Hi.

288
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:01,521
Hi.

289
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:06,324
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

290
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:09,428
Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross,

291
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:10,995
- Ben just said 'Hi'.
- Wha, what?

292
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:13,514
- Ben just said hi.
- What, the word hi?

293
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:16,509
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.

294
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:19,732
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.

295
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:23,343
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.

296
00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:26,145
- Hello. 
-벤 어딨어요?

297
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:29,850
얼마나 보고 싶었는지 몰라 
이리오렴, 벤

298
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,202
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.

299
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:34,399
What did he say?

300
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:37,131
Something about hi.

301
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:40,228
- That's so exciting.
- Mommy is so proud of you.

302
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:42,723
Hi. Hi.

303
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,526
You know, actually it's more like, hi.

304
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:50,187
- Hi. 
- Hi. 
- Hi.
- Hi. 
- Hi. 
- Hi. 
- Hi.

305
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:52,610
Ok, this could go on for a while.

306
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,539
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.

307
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:59,392
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say?

308
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:01,448
Ok. Alright so I've got him.

309
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:03,092
- Tuesday.
- Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.

310
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:06,265
- Take care.
- Bye Ben.

311
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:07,291
Bye.

312
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:13,474
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye.

313
00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:15,120
You said, you said bye to me.

314
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,794
You said bye to me.

315
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:21,357
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.

316
00:20:21,357 --> 00:20:26,874
- We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
- Alright, alright, ok. Bye.

317
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:36,400
- Bye. 
- Bye. 
- Bye.
- Bye. 
- Bye. 
- Bye.

318
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:48,769
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.

319
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:55,849
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him.

320
00:20:55,849 --> 00:21:01,220
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again.

321
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,526
But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it.

322
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:12,271
And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so.

323
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,390
- Ok, here we go.
- Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey,

324
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,926
what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago.

325
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:22,507
Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.

326
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:26,057
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
