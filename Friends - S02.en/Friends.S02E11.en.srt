1
00:00:01,228 --> 00:00:09,561
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh,

2
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:12,003
Him. Hi!

3
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,243
- So how did everything go?
- Oh, great. Great.

4
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:20,248
There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.

5
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:22,885
- Well, we've gotta go.
- Ok.

6
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:27,431
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.

7
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:30,431
- Oh, you and me?
- Uh, no, Susan and me.

8
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:33,066
The other us.

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,249
Ok.

10
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:39,953
We're uh, we're getting married.

11
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:47,596
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?

12
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:52,400
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,473
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.

14
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,531
Look I just thought that...

15
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:01,599
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you?

16
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:05,541
What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy?

17
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,647
I'm revelling baby, believe me!

18
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:11,945
- Is your finger caught in that chair?
- Mmm hmmm.

19
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:14,718
- Want us to go?
- Uh-huh.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
F r i e n d s
Season 211.The One With the Lesbian Wedding

21
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:06,224
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.

22
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:08,889
It really hit me last night.

23
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:18,070
I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..

24
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:21,400
- Yes!
- What?

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,801
Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.

26
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:29,765
Yes!

27
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:33,362
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before,

28
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,073
and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?

29
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,075
- Would it matter?
- Oh, you are so great! Thank you!

30
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:42,402
- Are you really not going?
- I am really not going.

31
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:46,118
I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?

32
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:51,829
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.

33
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:54,386
If you wanna call that a reason.

34
00:02:55,357 --> 00:03:02,467
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room?

35
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,721
Hi, neighbor.

36
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,557
- Ross, I thought you were over this.
- Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok?

37
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:13,916
She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.

38
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:19,024
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.

39
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:21,890
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?

40
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,162
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.

41
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:29,605
- Whoa, she's pretty.
- Yeah, and she's really nice too.

42
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:36,764
She taught me all about you know, how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.

43
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:39,958
- I'm sorry, what?
- What?

44
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:46,385
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one.

45
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:51,166
So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know,

46
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,069
like this.

47
00:03:56,843 --> 00:03:58,633
Oh, ok.

48
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:01,077
There's my scene, there's my scene.

49
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,641
- Mrs. Wallace,
- Yes.

50
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:08,232
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.

51
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:10,439
Is she gonna be all right?

52
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,155
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected.

53
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:17,394
Your sister is suffering from a..

54
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,658
subcranial hematoma.

55
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:31,233
Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.

56
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,154
- Nice!
- That's great! 
Excellent!

57
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:41,953
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.

58
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,270
That is so good! Do it again!

59
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,666
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"

60
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,984
That's great.

61
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:57,126
All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

62
00:04:57,126 --> 00:05:01,930
- No no, that's me.
- Oh, yeah.

63
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,965
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...

64
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:11,889
- Is everything ok?
- Um, no, huh-uh.

65
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,509
One of my clients died on the massage table today.

66
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:18,589
Oh my god.

67
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:22,053
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.

68
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:30,710
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.

69
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,309
- Oh, honey.
- Yeah, it's just so strange.

70
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:36,882
I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast,

71
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:44,834
and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it."

72
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:53,509
Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and

73
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:59,605
when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.

74
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,344
What do you mean?

75
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:04,528
I think it went into me.

76
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:15,435
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.

77
00:06:15,435 --> 00:06:17,314
Well, of course, lambs are scarier.

78
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:21,915
Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.

79
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,852
Ok, who ordered what?

80
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:28,355
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.

81
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:32,274
- Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
- Oh god.

82
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:35,807
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.

83
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:37,954
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and

84
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:41,868
I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?

85
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:49,152
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.

86
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:56,046
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?

87
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:59,569
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.

88
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,554
Sit up!

89
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:07,034
- There she is.
- Mom!

90
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:15,788
Sweetie! So this is where you work?

91
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:22,433
Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

92
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:23,969
But I guess that's the fun.

93
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:26,251
Pretty much. Here's my frends.

94
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:32,793
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.

95
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:35,789
This is Joey,

96
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,706
and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.

97
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,954
- Oh hello, Ross.
- Hi, Mrs. Green.

98
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:49,072
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?

99
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:50,829
Oh Mom!

100
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:56,398
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.

101
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:59,641
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

102
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:04,756
This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked.

103
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:08,934
I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house.

104
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,641
I am just so proud of you.

105
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,395
- Really?
- Yes.

106
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:15,950
I know who it is you remind me of.

107
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,730
Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift.

108
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,110
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

109
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:28,805
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?

110
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:32,037
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?

111
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:40,271
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.

112
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:45,033
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.

113
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:49,026
You have some life here, sweetie.

114
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:55,472
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything,

115
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:58,405
but this is just so much better for me, you know?

116
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:02,395
I do. You didn't love Barry.

117
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:05,281
And I've never seen you this happy.

118
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:09,547
I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.

119
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:15,763
- For...me.
- Well, not just for you.

120
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,985
Well, what do you mean?

121
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:23,110
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.

122
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:30,972
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.

123
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,590
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.

124
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,570
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.

125
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,591
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?

126
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:46,450
None.

127
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,748
- They didn't fight a lot?
- No! They didn't even talk to each other.

128
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:54,685
God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?

129
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:58,830
In my day, divorce was not an option.

130
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,427
Hey, look who's up.

131
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:08,687
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced.

132
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:12,028
I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.

133
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:17,146
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.

134
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:21,612
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?

135
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:24,644
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and

136
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:27,678
she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves.

137
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:30,524
But in your case it's actually kinda true.

138
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,800
That's him.

139
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,945
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.

140
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,347
- Phoebe?
- Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman.

141
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,312
Thanks for meeting me.

142
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:47,112
Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.

143
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:48,311
Um, do you wanna sit?

144
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:52,917
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up.

145
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,788
Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?

146
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,915
I don't know how to say this, but

147
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:06,230
I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.

148
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,032
You're saying, my wife is in you?

149
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:12,236
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but

150
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:17,106
um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?

151
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:21,075
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that

152
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:25,755
she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.

153
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:28,089
- Everything?
- Everything.

154
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,957
Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.

155
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:35,769
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.

156
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,684
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.

157
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,318
Worth a shot, huh?

158
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,769
Look at this.

159
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:01,439
These are from Halloween three years ago.

160
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:03,207
Oh, look, here's Barry.

161
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,484
Did he have to come straight from the office?

162
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:08,994
No, that was his costume.

163
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:14,091
See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.

164
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:15,570
Um, you guys,

165
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,793
you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?

166
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:23,507
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."

167
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:27,146
Really? Weird. Anyway,

168
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:32,875
see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.

169
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,405
- Hey, Mon, you want some help?
- If you want.

170
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:40,087
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:45,478
What a day. I took her everywhere.

172
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,720
The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.

173
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,039
She's still with you?

174
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,864
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.

175
00:12:56,864 --> 00:13:00,480
I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again.

176
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:05,042
Oh, such a pretty face.

177
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:10,952
This is so much fun, just the girls.

178
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:15,686
- You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
- God!

179
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,042
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.

180
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:28,958
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might.

181
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,673
So, what's new in sex?

182
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:34,716
Oh! What's new in sex?

183
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:37,474
The only man I've ever been with is your father.

184
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:40,394
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.

185
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:45,877
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.

186
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:48,594
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you.

187
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,865
Alright, alright.

188
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:53,892
I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy.

189
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:55,558
What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?

190
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:57,210
- No.
- You want me to talk you out of it?

191
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,949
- No.
- Then what? What do you want?

192
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:01,757
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.

193
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,122
Why on earth would I understand this?

194
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:11,449
- You didn't marry your Barry honey. But I married my....
- Oh.

195
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:17,999
All right people, we're in trouble here.

196
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:22,072
We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!

197
00:14:22,072 --> 00:14:25,790
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.

198
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:28,825
Joey, speed it up!

199
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:33,228
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!

200
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:37,350
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.

201
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:44,465
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?

202
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:48,340
Sir! No sir!

203
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,563
All right, you!

204
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:54,071
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.

205
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:58,385
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do.

206
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:04,395
But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross".

207
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,292
All right, ball the melon.

208
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:10,789
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.

209
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,234
- Hi.
- How's it going?

210
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:19,316
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.

211
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:24,154
Fine, whatever.

212
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:25,491
What's the matter?

213
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,795
Nothing. Ok, everything.

214
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:31,673
I think we're calling off the wedding.

215
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:35,390
- What?
- You're still gonna pay me, right?

216
00:15:36,363 --> 00:15:38,826
Or something a little less selfish.

217
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:41,310
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?

218
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,547
- My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
- Oh my god.

219
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:48,248
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing,

220
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,401
but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.

221
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:52,664
It's ok. I'm sorry.

222
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:55,547
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because

223
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:59,744
I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us,

224
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:06,786
and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.

225
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:11,433
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.

226
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,309
You do?

227
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:17,841
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.

228
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,234
Of course I do.

229
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:25,756
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them.

230
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:33,874
Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me.

231
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:40,113
Look, this is your wedding. Do it.

232
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:42,989
You're right. Of course you're right.

233
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:45,674
- So we're back on?
- We're back on.

234
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:49,514
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil!

235
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,111
I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.

236
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:09,082
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing.

237
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:14,918
I feel like Superman without my powers, you know?

238
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:19,691
I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.

239
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,309
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok?

240
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:29,113
The world is my lesbian wedding.

241
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:46,883
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.

242
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:21,606
- Thank you.
- Any time.

243
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:26,513
Ross.

244
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:33,688
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people,

245
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:36,674
any two people, come together in love.

246
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:41,673
Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.

247
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:46,188
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything!

248
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:56,029
Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.

249
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:08,755
- Would you look at them?
- Yeah, can't help but.

250
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:17,093
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you?

251
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:20,767
I wrapped those bad boys.

252
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,012
- I miss Rose.
- Oh, yeah?

253
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:27,803
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know,

254
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:30,445
and now I just feel kind of alone.

255
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:35,642
You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said,

256
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:40,232
and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...

257
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:44,987
-how 'bout we go get you a drink?
- Ok, that's so nice.

258
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:55,871
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?

259
00:19:57,324 --> 00:19:59,002
Hey, Mom? Having fun?

260
00:19:59,002 --> 00:20:04,425
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman.

261
00:20:04,425 --> 00:20:08,310
And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet.

262
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:14,356
Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.

263
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,953
There's more alcohol, right?

264
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:27,195
- How you doin'?
- Ok.

265
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:29,803
- You did a good thing today.
- Yeah.

266
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:37,949
- You wanna dance?
- No, that's fine.

267
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:42,871
Come on. I'll let you lead.

268
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,470
Ok.

269
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:06,446
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.

270
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,004
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?

271
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:20,680
- Well, Mon, I was married.
- Yeah, me, too, technically.

272
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,911
- I had a wedding.
- All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.

273
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:29,314
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?

274
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,332
Isn't Ben in this?

275
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:38,631
Oh, yeah!
