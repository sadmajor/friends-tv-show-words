1
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:09,234
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.

2
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,751
I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.

3
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:15,556
You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.

4
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:20,223
Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time.

5
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:26,064
Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.

6
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,390
Here it is, here it is.

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,947
The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was

8
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:36,879
Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.

9
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:39,273
OK, look, that is one guy's opinion.

10
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,885
Alright, Phoebs, read yours.

11
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:45,875
OK. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...

12
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:49,043
Does anyone have one from a different paper?

13
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:50,852
Ross, read yours.

14
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:52,781
I don't want to.

15
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:57,315
- Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:58,861
Maybe they do.

17
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:03,007
I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.

18
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:05,288
Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.

19
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:09,756
No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.

20
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:16,404
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind.

21
00:01:16,404 --> 00:01:23,953
In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153...

22
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:26,095
sucking.

23
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:33,000

Season 210.The One With Russ

24
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:13,362
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian,

25
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:16,973
but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.

26
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:22,726
- Hiiiiii.
- Are... are you OK?

27
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:29,431
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid.

28
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:35,229
Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?

29
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:38,031
- Maybe.
- Don't toy with me.

30
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:40,792
- Geller!
- Hey, Fun Bobby!

31
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,287
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?

32
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,477
Not at all! I love this guy.

33
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:48,812
Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!

34
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:49,831
You and me both.

35
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:51,630
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?

36
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,036
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.

37
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:57,153
- Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
- No, I'm alright man. Really.

38
00:02:57,153 --> 00:03:00,904
- No, I'm picking you up.
- Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me...

39
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,232
Alright! It still works.

40
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:09,198
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?

41
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,110
I'm still gonna go.

42
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,036
OK, I'll see you later babe.

43
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:18,607
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.

44
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,146
- See ya.
- Bye! See you later!

45
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:29,722
Fun Bobby is so great.

46
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:33,642
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him.

47
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:39,411
I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend.

48
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:42,244
Well, at least my cup is half full.

49
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:46,489
Half full of looooovvvvve.

50
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,236
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.

51
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:53,310
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.

52
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:56,517
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.

53
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:58,208
Really? I only had two glasses.

54
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,114
- I just had a glass.
- Two.

55
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,434
I had one glass.

56
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:06,763
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.

57
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:13,351
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?

58
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:24,962
- Oooooh.
- Ooooooh.

59
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:27,634
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.

60
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:33,804
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.

61
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:39,483
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK,

62
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:42,995
'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,'

63
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:47,882
or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'

64
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:52,395
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?

65
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:55,794
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink.

66
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,983
I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink?

67
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:03,684
Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.

68
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,950
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

69
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,032
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.

70
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:18,787
- Mmmm, no.
- Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.

71
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:25,265
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?

72
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:30,148
Um, cake.

73
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:34,712
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.

74
00:05:34,712 --> 00:05:39,086
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.

75
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:43,593
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.

76
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,123
- Bobby.
- Yeah, OK.

77
00:05:46,123 --> 00:05:51,789
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but,

78
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,143
uh, I'm kind of worried about you.

79
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:58,232
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but,

80
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,879
I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like...

81
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,971
uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'

82
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,715
So, what are you saying now?

83
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:13,911
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit.

84
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,952
I kinda like that you worry about me.

85
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:23,323
- Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
- I am gonna try and quit drinking.

86
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:26,087
Ooohh, why?

87
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:31,789
- Hey. 
Hey.
- Hey. 
Hey.

88
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,354
Guess who's back in show business.

89
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:37,958
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?

90
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,306
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.

91
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:43,870
Oh, no.

92
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,967
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.

93
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:52,712
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for "Days of Our Lives."!

94
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:58,370
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.

95
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,707
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.

96
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:09,202
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.

97
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:13,712
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.

98
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:16,266
You have other friends?

99
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:19,225
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.

100
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:22,317
- What?
- With a man?

101
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,752
What? What is so strange about me having a date?

102
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:28,851
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?

103
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:34,153
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.

104
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:34,153
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

105
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:41,793
Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.

106
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,392
But you guys came so close.

107
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:49,189
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.

108
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,994
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.

109
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,963
Hhhhiiiii.

110
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,991
No. Nooo, no, no. I'm not saying you're not talented, you're very talented.

111
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,318
It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left.

112
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:20,315
Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.

113
00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:25,234
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?

114
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:28,783
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.

115
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:32,194
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?

116
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:36,316
- No.
- Well, here it is.

117
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:43,889
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...

118
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:48,800
- Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
- Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but...

119
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,707
I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me.

120
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:59,072
And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know...

121
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:04,595
if I would have sent the Little General in.

122
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:10,156
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and

123
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:12,796
we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out.

124
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:17,544
Yeah, hi, Lori please.

125
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:24,923
Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific?

126
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:29,078
Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh.

127
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,398
OK, doll. Talk to you later.

128
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:34,274
Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.

129
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,202
- What's the matter?
- It's Fun Bobby.

130
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:42,629
- What, isn't he sober?
- Oh, he's sober alright.

131
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:46,113
- Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
- Ohhh, OK.

132
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:52,634
Alright, here you go, sweetie.

133
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,450
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?

134
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,412
Oh God, yes!

135
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:04,252
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.

136
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:08,087
That is funny.

137
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:13,107
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but

138
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:20,645
apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.

139
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:28,750
- Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
- Oh yeah.

140
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:32,913
- See you guys.
- Bye.....

141
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:36,664
ridiculously dull Bobby.

142
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:39,636
- Oh.... my... God.
- It's not that bad.

143
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:43,704
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?

144
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:47,075
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.

145
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:50,103
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.

146
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:54,876
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life.

147
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:57,754
I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking.

148
00:10:57,754 --> 00:10:59,152
He's dull because of me.

149
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:03,309
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull.

150
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:07,075
You just, you know, set it free.

151
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:10,314
- Hi.
- Hey Ross.... bahhhh!

152
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:14,244
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?

153
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:20,406
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh...

154
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:25,115
chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.

155
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,350
- Rachel? Um, hi.

156
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,118
- Hi.

157
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:34,896
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?

158
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:38,918
- Uhh.... waitressing?
- Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm...

159
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:43,478
doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?

160
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,375
Huh, Bob Saget?

161
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,915
Oh, yeah!

162
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,155
No, no, no, no, oh, oh.

163
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:51,904
Oh, my, oh!

164
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:55,068
- What? What's wrong?
- I, OK....

165
00:11:55,068 --> 00:12:00,705
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.

166
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,796
Alright.

167
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:06,931
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK.

168
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:10,271
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.

169
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,765
- Hi.
- Hi.

170
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:18,788
- Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
- Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?

171
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:23,352
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know,

172
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:28,634
a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.

173
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:32,156
- A date.
- Yeah, I'm her date.

174
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:36,584
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.

175
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:41,250
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.

176
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,431
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.

177
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:49,203
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....

178
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,526
Periodontist.

179
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:55,987
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.

180
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:59,740
Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage.

181
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,789
- It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
- Ditto.

182
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:12,309
- I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
- Oh.

183
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:16,178
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.

184
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:19,509
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....

185
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:25,595
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other...

186
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:30,102
uh... winged things... who's, uh,

187
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:36,155
let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know.

188
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:39,152
But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...

189
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,834
- Well, yeah, this is the deal.
- OK, well, um, have a nice evening.

190
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:45,626
- Um, Russ, you ready?
- Yeah.

191
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:51,391
- Bye. 
Bye.
Bye.

192
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:54,583
She's dating. She's dating.

193
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,553
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?

194
00:13:58,553 --> 00:13:59,855
What do you mean?

195
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,060
Do you not see it?

196
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,985
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober.

197
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:10,396
And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh,

198
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:13,784
hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.

199
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:18,008
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?

200
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:20,151
....................Yeah.

201
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:27,719
- Hey.
- Hey.

202
00:14:30,393 --> 00:14:35,607
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.

203
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:38,029
Well, the part's mine if I want it.

204
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,001
Oh my God!

205
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,831
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.

206
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:45,632
Oh my... God?

207
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:49,992
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years!

208
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:53,924
I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.

209
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,508
So, what're you gonna do?

210
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:59,689
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?

211
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:04,074
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.

212
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:08,568
- I've never slept with someone for a part.
- Well is she...

213
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,990
Sorry.

214
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,044
- It's alright. Is she good-looking?
- Yeah,

215
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:21,236
she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast.

216
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:25,083
You know, after having slept with her.

217
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:30,531
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal.

218
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:36,596
Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex.

219
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:41,210
Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.

220
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:46,910
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know?

221
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,755
I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back

222
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:57,797
and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.

223
00:15:57,797 --> 00:16:00,318
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?

224
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:04,913
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.

225
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:13,249
- Can I get you something from the bar?
- Yes, I would like something.

226
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,718
No, no thank you.

227
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:19,247
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.

228
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:24,322
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.

229
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:26,193
So the light went out in my refrigerator...

230
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:30,590
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.

231
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:37,423
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ?

232
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:43,627
OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.

233
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:48,864
- Dysprosium.
- Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.

234
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:53,236
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down,

235
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:57,185
Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.

236
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,206
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?

237
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:02,153
What?

238
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,908
OK honey, you're dating Ross.

239
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:06,867
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.

240
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,114
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!

241
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:13,848
- Steve... sleeve!
- OK, noone is named Sleeve.

242
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:15,767
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about?

243
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:20,033
Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.

244
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:24,186
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.

245
00:17:24,186 --> 00:17:29,186
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.

246
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:34,270
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.

247
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,369
- I know what your problem is.
- Oh you do, do you?

248
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:41,361
Um-hum, you're jealous.

249
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,079
Of... of what?

250
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,688
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.

251
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:53,348
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in.

252
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:56,511
It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.

253
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:58,370
- Hey, you listen.
- No, no, let me finish.

254
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,356
- No, let me finish.
- No, you let me fini...

255
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:05,837
- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:14,584
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!

257
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,272
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?

258
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:19,436
No, I don't even think he knew.

259
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:22,046
Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?

260
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:24,211
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?

261
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,598
Me.

262
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,511
Why would I have to sleep with you?

263
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:32,307
It's my game. You want the job or not?

264
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,511
- Hey.
- Morning.

265
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:37,809
Where ya goin'?

266
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:40,586
- Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
- Ooooohhhh.

267
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,914
What's with all the bottles of liquor?

268
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,244
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?

269
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:49,606
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me.

270
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:55,065
That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.

271
00:18:58,242 --> 00:19:02,796
Oh God, even his knock is boring.

272
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,896
- Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
- Uh, can I talk to you a minute?

273
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,526
Sure.

274
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:11,467
This is really hard for me to say.

275
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:14,957
- Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
- Oh, no, no,

276
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:16,355
it's about you.

277
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,207
What about me?

278
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,717
I think you may have a drinking problem.

279
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:29,281
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.

280
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:34,523
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?

281
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:38,583
Oh... shoot.

282
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,591
- Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
- OK.

283
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:48,860
- Take care.
- You too.

284
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:53,750
What happened?

285
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:56,988
Well we... we kinda broke up.

286
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,184
Awwwwwwww.

287
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:07,238
Does anybody want these?

288
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:11,713
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.

289
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:16,753
- Hey.
- Hey!

290
00:20:16,753 --> 00:20:18,285
How'd the callback go?

291
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,870
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.

292
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,830
- So what'd you do?
- Well, I couldn't do it.

293
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,641
I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.

294
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,639
- Good for you.

295
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:32,790
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.

296
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,477
- So... and?
- Soooooo...

297
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:39,412
you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon,

298
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:42,839
recurring in at least four episodes!

299
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:46,319
- Allright!
- Alright... I've got to go shower.

300
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,793
- Hi.
- Oh, hey. 
- Hi.

301
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,234
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.

302
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:06,291
Yeah, I'm sorry man.

303
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:11,715
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?

304
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,766
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget.

305
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,586
- She hates him.
- Oh.

306
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:21,489
- Hey. 
- Hey! 
- Hey, Julie!

307
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,353
Hey, how are you doing?

308
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:28,508
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK.

309
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:33,739
Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
