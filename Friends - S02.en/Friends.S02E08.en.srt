1
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:06,787
Ross kissed me.

2
00:00:06,787 --> 00:00:09,186
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

3
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:10,626
It was unbelievable!

4
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:13,837
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

5
00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:15,503
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything.

6
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:18,386
Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone.

7
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:21,650
Rachel, does this end well or do
we need to get tissues?

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,743
Oh, it ended very well. 
Oh.

9
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:28,034
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.

10
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:30,590
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,704
Was it like, was it like a soft brush against
your lips? Or was it like a, you know,

12
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:37,039
a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,265
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then,

14
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:44,515
oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.

15
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:48,397
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you?
Or was his hand like on your back?

16
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:51,956
No, actually first they started on my waist.

17
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:54,687
And then, they slid up, and then,
they were in my hair.

18
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,292
Ohhhh.

19
00:00:57,547 --> 00:01:00,263
And, uh, and then I kissed her.

20
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:03,917
Tongue? 
Yeah. 
Cool.

21
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,194
All right, check out this bad boy.

22
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,589
12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive.

23
00:01:54,589 --> 00:02:00,555
Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and
a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.

24
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:03,007
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?

25
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,063
Games and stuff.

26
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:09,411
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.

27
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:14,242
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you
be willing to cook naked?

28
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,951
There's an ad for a naked chef?

29
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:22,995
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you
might be willing to dance naked. And then...

30
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,884
Hi.

31
00:02:24,884 --> 00:02:28,666
Hey, oh, so, um... how'd you make out last night?

32
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:38,069
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny.
No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful

33
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:40,804
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.

34
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:46,550
Yeah, it was, but... I get home, ok, and I see
Julie's saline solution on my night table.

35
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,943
And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god,
what the hell am I doing?

36
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:52,208
I mean, here I am, I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman,

37
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,112
who I care about and who cares about me,

38
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:57,306
and I'm like, what, am I just
gonna throw all that away?

39
00:02:57,306 --> 00:03:00,710
You got all that from saline solution?

40
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,875
We are talking about Rachel here.
You and Rachel.

41
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:07,185
Believe me, I've been dreaming about
me and Rachel for ten years now.

42
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:14,547
But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and
Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and...

43
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:16,882
...Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

44
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:18,152
Hey, you.

45
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,471
How are you?

46
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:22,111
Good. How are you? 
Good.

47
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:22,824
Hi, honey.

48
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:29,149
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?

49
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:30,832
Good. 
Good.

50
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:37,755
So everybody's here. Everybody's good.

51
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:40,162
So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?

52
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:43,056
Oh, well, actually. 
Play it.

53
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,845
Ok, all right.

54
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,477
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.

55
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,063
What? 
Ssshh.

56
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:56,529
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um,

57
00:03:56,529 --> 00:04:05,104
this is a song about a love triangle
between three people that I made up.

58
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:09,396
Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".

59
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:15,087
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty,

60
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:18,927
and a guy let's call him Neil.

61
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:23,008
Now I can't stress this point too strongly,

62
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:28,064
this story isn't real.

63
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:32,600
Now our Neil must decide, who will
be the girl that he casts aside.

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,084
Will Betty be the one who he loves truly?

65
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:39,794
Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...vLoolie?

66
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:50,110
He must decide, he must decide, even
though I made him up, he must decide!

67
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,986
This is a nice resume.

68
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:59,423
Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.

69
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:04,221
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this
job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.

70
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,210
Mockolate.

71
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,917
I'm sorry?

72
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:11,113
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.

73
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:13,103
Ohh.

74
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:14,759
Go ahead. Try a piece.

75
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,002
Yeah, we think that Mockolate is
even better than chocolate.

76
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:19,401
All right.

77
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:25,483
Mmm-mmm.

78
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:27,690
Yeah?

79
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,995
I love how it crumbles. Now see,
your chocolate doesn't do that.

80
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:33,766
No, ma'am.

81
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:38,432
Well, anyhoo, we should be getting
our F.D.A. approval any day now,

82
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:41,068
hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

83
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:42,315
See, the way we look at it,

84
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:45,502
chocolate already dominates most of
your major food-preparation holidays:

85
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:48,007
Easter, Christmas, what have you.

86
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:50,633
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing,

87
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:54,520
we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.

88
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,429
Wow.

89
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:58,765
Aren't you going to swallow that?

90
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:01,704
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.

91
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:03,466
Yeah, isn't that great?

92
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:10,309
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs
who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes.

93
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:11,506
You think you might be interested?

94
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:16,590
Abso...lutely.

95
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,023
See, I love creating new recipes.
I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now,

96
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:22,810
I love Mockolate. 
Really?

97
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,436
Especially the after taste, you know,
I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.

98
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,046
How about Mockolate mousse?

99
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:37,166
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.

100
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,603
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?

101
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,063
What makes it pilgrim?

102
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:44,268
We'll put buckles on it.

103
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,025
Hey. 
Hey. 
Hey.

104
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,564
Did uh, Ross call?

105
00:06:48,564 --> 00:06:50,592
No, I'm sorry.

106
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:52,801
Why didn't he call?

107
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,542
He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he?

108
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,746
He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all,

109
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:59,234
"Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me,

110
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:04,793
and we're gonna to get married, have
a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."

111
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:08,913
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.

112
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:13,982
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do?
I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.

113
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:19,433
Oh, I know. This must be so hard.
Oh, no. Two women love me.

114
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:21,181
They're both gorgeous and sexy.

115
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:26,463
My wallet's too small for my fifties,
and my diamond shoes are too tight.

116
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,353
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.

117
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:31,275
Don't touch the computer.
Don't ever touch the computer.

118
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:34,031
Ross, listen. I got two words for you.

119
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:36,825
Threesome.

120
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:48,323
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok?
We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons.

121
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:53,785
We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts,
and I can use different colors for each column.

122
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:55,462
Can't we just use a pen?

123
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:59,123
No, Amish boy.

124
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:02,745
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun.

125
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:04,637
Rachel first.

126
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:12,391
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you
can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.

127
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,755
You could say that.

128
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:19,949
And I guess, you know, sometimes,
she's a little ditzy, you know.

129
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:23,432
And I've seen her be a little too into her looks.

130
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:28,603
Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common
'cause we're both paleontologists, but

131
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:30,714
Rachel's just a waitress.

132
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:36,990
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom?

133
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,479
Or we could keep doing this. What else?

134
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,384
I don't know.

135
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:49,870
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.

136
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,247
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?

137
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:58,437
She's not Rachel.

138
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:05,103
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust.

139
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:08,869
This is mockolate cranberry cake,
and these are mockolate chip cookies.

140
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:10,905
Just like the Indians served.

141
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:15,386
Oh my god.

142
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:16,556
Oh my god good?

143
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:21,066
Oh my god, I can't believe you
let me put this in my mouth.

144
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:26,546
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!

145
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,226
I'm telling you this thing won't print.

146
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:35,944
Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times.

147
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:39,513
You know, for a hot line you are not so hot.

148
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:42,038
What? What is that in the background?

149
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:45,429
Are you watching Star Trek?

150
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:53,126
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie?
Did you, did you break her heart?

151
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:59,570
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

152
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,822
Anyway, I did the right thing.

153
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:07,159
So, Spock actually hugs his father?

154
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,669
Hey, do you guys have...

155
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:11,428
hi.

156
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:12,890
Hi.

157
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,966
Where you goin'?

158
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:19,969
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.

159
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:21,109
Oh.

160
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:26,643
No, no, uh, it's not what you think.
It's um the other thing.

161
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:37,784
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?

162
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,090
Well, uh.

163
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,037
He broke up with Julie.

164
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:46,367
Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.

165
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,432
Really?

166
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:52,159
Really. It's always been you, Rach.

167
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:07,071
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.

168
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:15,920
I know, I know, it's, it's almost...

169
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,724
What do you say we go take a walk,
just us, not them?

170
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:20,868
Let me get my coat.

171
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:24,527
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.

172
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:30,749
Ok.

173
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:32,824
He's goin' to get my coat.

174
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:38,633
He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys.
I can't believe this. This is unbelievable.

175
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:39,758
What's that?

176
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:42,679
What? Nothing.

177
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,399
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?

178
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,438
No, no, see? See?

179
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:51,575
Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!

180
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:53,147
Well what is it? Let me see.

181
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:54,748
Hey, someone order a coat?

182
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,989
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me
on his computer and he won't let me see.

183
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:01,438
He won't? He won't!

184
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:06,386
Because, isn't that, isn't that the,
the short story you were writing?

185
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:10,230
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.

186
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,124
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.

187
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:15,465
No!

188
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:16,281
Come on.

189
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:20,460
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?

190
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,009
Alright.

191
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:45,445
"It was summer, and it was hot.

192
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:50,202
Rachel was there.

193
00:12:50,202 --> 00:13:03,264
A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and
then the kingdom was his forever. The end."

194
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:07,874
That's it? That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the whole world.

195
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:09,666
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore.

196
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:13,591
There's something about me on that
piece of paper and I want to see it.

197
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:17,144
No, you don't.

198
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:18,224
All right, you know what, that's fine.

199
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,677
If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine.

200
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,666
I do not need to see it.

201
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:36,191
What is this? Ross, what is this?

Good luck.

202
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:42,396
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?

203
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:46,965
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks?

204
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,010
Spoiled?

205
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:53,124
Now that's a little spoiled.
He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.

206
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,009
Just a waitress?

207
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:04,556
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed
to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?

208
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:08,766
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!

209
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:13,305
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.

210
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:17,624
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem?

211
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:22,789
Is that some stupid paleontology word that
I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.

212
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:35,329
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no!
She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?

213
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:40,988
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant.
I should have told her it was my diary,

214
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:43,099
she never would have made me read her my diary.

215
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:48,898
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person
to have around the day after an emergency.

216
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:52,115
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list.

217
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:54,751
What a dinkus.

218
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:58,266
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.

219
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,789
What? 
What?

220
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:03,183
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.

221
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:04,863
This was your idea? 
What were you thinking?

222
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:09,201
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok?
These things, they happen for a reason.

223
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:12,308
Yeah. You!

224
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:16,555
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok?
You believe in that karma crap, don't you?

225
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:21,662
Yeah, by the way, good luck in
your next life as a dung beetle.

226
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:41,117
Rach! Whoops!

227
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:43,629
Rach, hey, open up, please!

228
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:47,435
When somebody does not buzz you in,
Ross, that means go away.

229
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:49,666
That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.

230
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,832
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.

231
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:55,083
Not interested.

232
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:59,634
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows.

233
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:03,023
Number two: how much you love your friends.

234
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:07,149
Number three: the way you play with
your hair when you're nervous.

235
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,103
Number four: how brave you
are for starting your life over.

236
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,223
Number five: how great you are with Ben.

237
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,510
Number six: the way you smell.

238
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:20,511
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?

239
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,153
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?

240
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:23,961
Oh, yeah, I do.

241
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:26,026
What are you doing out there?

242
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,430
I am, uh, I am...

243
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,547
Oh, you must be freezing.
You know what you need?

244
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:33,347
How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?

245
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:40,399
Rach, come on, open up.
Rach, come on, come on, Rach.

246
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,544
You got to give me another chance.

247
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,227
No.

248
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:46,585
No? 
That's what I said.

249
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:47,603
Look, maybe we should go?

250
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:49,950
No, you guys, you really don't
have to go, we're done talking.

251
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,646
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.

252
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:53,825
No, you don't, Ross.

253
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:57,758
Imagine the worst things you think about yourself.

254
00:16:57,758 --> 00:17:03,789
Now, how would you feel if the one person that you
trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too,

255
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:08,168
but actually uses them as
reasons not to be with you.

256
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:13,026
No, but, but I wanna be with
you in spite of all those things.

257
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:17,880
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross.
I said don't go!

258
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:24,834
You know what? You know what? If,
things were the other way around,

259
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:30,444
there's nothing you could put on a list that
would ever make me not want to be with you.

260
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:33,107
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us.

261
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:36,224
See, I'd never make a list.

262
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:56,840
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in
this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know?

263
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,671
Maybe a little longer.

264
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:07,123
Now, in some of these recipes,
the quantities may seem just a little unusual,

265
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:09,795
uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars.

266
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:13,692
I've indicated four cups of coconut, and
four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh,

267
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,178
one tablespoon of mockolate.

268
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:19,586
Doesn't matter. 
What?

269
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:22,241
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

270
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:26,389
Something about laboratory rats.

271
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:28,323
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

272
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:31,912
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check.

273
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:34,530
Thank you for all the trouble you went through.

274
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,712
Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it
while you were cooking, did you?

275
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:40,043
Well, uh, I ate some.

276
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:44,259
Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine.
Some is not a lot.

277
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:48,221
So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?

278
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,887
Hello?

279
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:04,228
Hi.

280
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:11,784
Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone,
but my ankles are weighin' me down.

281
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,108
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.

282
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:17,439
Look, can, can you do something for me?

283
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:25,554
Sure, what? Ok, ok.

284
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,469
Music?

285
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,274
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross.

286
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:42,673
Rachel, he wants you to know
he's deeply sorry for what he did

287
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:45,850
and he hopes you can find it in
your heart to forgive him.

288
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:20,443
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel,
and she told us what Ross did.

289
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:23,377
It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening,

290
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:26,281
I don't wanna play your song anymore.

291
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:34,409
Why don't we devote our time to
a couple that stands a chance?

292
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:39,905
Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her
car and she hopes you two will work it out.

293
00:21:12,364 --> 00:21:14,510
Hi, thanks for coming in again.

294
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,622
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.

295
00:21:17,622 --> 00:21:20,518
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror.

296
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:24,504
Anyway, they're called "fishtachios".

297
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:30,840
They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're
made primarily of reconstituted fish bits.

298
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,941
Here, try one.

299
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:36,176
You're not allergic to anything, are you?

300
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:39,434
Cat hair. 
Oh, sorry.
