1
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:10,604
Hey Eddie. Daahh!!

2
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:11,667
What're you doin' here?

3
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:14,359
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:16,029
Why?

5
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:20,363
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.

6
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:22,037
I can't sleep now.

7
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:23,948
You want me to sing?

8
00:00:23,948 --> 00:00:29,076
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.

9
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:31,152
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.

10
00:00:31,152 --> 00:00:33,195
Hannibal Lecter...

11
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:36,411
better roommate than you.

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:40,610
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared,

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,170
I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh?

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,924
What about last night when you went and got a drink of water andI was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?

15
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,062
- I didn't realize that.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:55,229
GET OUT NOW!!

17
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,030
Ok, you really want me out?

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,192
Yes please.

19
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:01,048
Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.

20
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:05,472
- I want you out.
- No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.

21
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:07,346
Where did you hear it from before?

22
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:10,724
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone,

23
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:13,820
you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.

24
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,511
I heard that.

25
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:26,511
F r i e n d s
Season 219. The One Where Eddie Won't Go

26
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:10,314
- Hey.
- Hey.

27
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:14,929
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?

28
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:17,927
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and

29
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:20,269
I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?

30
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:22,319
A mirror?

31
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,756
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.

32
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:30,270
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.

33
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,906
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one.

34
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:37,686
I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh?

35
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:40,951
I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.

36
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:43,113
Cache? Jaunty?

37
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:46,473
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper.

38
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:48,746
I'm gonna get some coffee.

39
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,710
- Hey.
-Hey. 
- Hey.

40
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,154
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?

41
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:56,145
Oh my God, it was incredible.

42
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:59,909
- Didn't it like totally speak to you?
- Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?

43
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:04,419
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called "Be Your Own Windkeeper."

44
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,891
It's about how women need to become more empowered.

45
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:10,450
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind

46
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:13,627
and the wind can make us Goddesses.

47
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:17,232
But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.

48
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,859
Men just take out wind?

49
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:25,083
- Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
- Wow. 
- Yeah.

50
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:31,104
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.

51
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:34,184
It is nothing like the Hobbit.

52
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:37,835
It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.

53
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:40,193
- Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
- No.

54
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,059
- No, 'cause he's yummy.
- Yes.

55
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:45,922
- But all the other ones.
- Oh yes.

56
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:50,357
Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power,

57
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:52,871
but God forbid we should take a sip.

58
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:53,970
Anybody want a croan.

59
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,033
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um,

60
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:04,437
'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'

61
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:14,247
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.

62
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:17,993
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?

63
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:23,839
Joey, look at me, look at me.

64
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:29,240
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

65
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,513
No, can we get back to me?

66
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:35,912
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business.

67
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:39,036
I already got you an audition for Another World.

68
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:43,210
Alright. Cab driver number two?

69
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,630
You're welcome.

70
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,848
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray.

71
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:52,519
How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?

72
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,855
Things change, roll with em.

73
00:04:55,855 --> 00:05:00,437
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards.

74
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:03,034
I'm not gonna do this.

75
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,059
Joey,

76
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:11,671
I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs.

77
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:16,802
Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.

78
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:21,318
I'm sorry. See ya.

79
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:26,472
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.

80
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:28,441
Isn't it.

81
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:30,959
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life.

82
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,611
I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.

83
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:39,513
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.

84
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:42,431
- Hey you guys.
- Hey.

85
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,152
Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.

86
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:45,673
NO!

87
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,635
No?

88
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:53,485
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?

89
00:05:53,485 --> 00:06:00,606
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.

90
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:07,147
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.

91
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:11,593
You go girl.

92
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:15,593
I can't pull that off can I?

93
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:20,242
- Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
- Yes, my wind.

94
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:24,713
How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?

95
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:39,268
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.

96
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:51,844
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now.

97
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,808
- I'm sorry.
- Um-um, um-um.

98
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:57,388
You're right, I don't have to apologize.

99
00:06:57,388 --> 00:07:00,364
Sorry. Damnit!

100
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:05,911
What is it?

101
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:12,229
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it.

102
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,910
I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.

103
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,112
See, this is why I don't date women who read.

104
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:22,633
- Uh-oh.
- What, what's that?

105
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:28,470
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two.

106
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,870
- That can't be good.
- Open it, open in.

107
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:36,315
- Oh my God.
- Woah.

108
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:38,851
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?

109
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:43,209
- Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
- Ahh.

110
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:49,038
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?

111
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,231
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me,

112
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:57,720
he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

113
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,074
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on "Another World."

114
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:03,002
- What?
- That audition.

115
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:05,581
That's a two line part.

116
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:09,315
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.

117
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:13,248
- So what.
- So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.

118
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:17,956
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.

119
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,109
- Toilet paper?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,916
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.

121
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,987
- Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
- I am your friend.

122
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:33,482
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,'
and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'

123
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:34,987
But I don't know it.

124
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:40,282
What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.

125
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:41,713
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.

126
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:45,105
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job,

127
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:47,349
who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.

128
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,591
- Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
- Huh, I'm just saying...

129
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:52,550
Well don't just say.

130
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,643
Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.

131
00:08:55,643 --> 00:09:01,247
- Ok.
- Ok. I'll see ya later.

132
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:03,073
Just think about it, ok.

133
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:07,352
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray.

134
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:09,398
That was huge.

135
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:13,368
Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross,

136
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:15,767
you still there?

137
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:28,105
- Hey pal.
- Ahhhh-gaaaahhh.

138
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:31,350
Eddie what're you still doin' here?

139
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,914
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!

140
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:42,194
- Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
- Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish.

141
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:44,628
He's a lot fiestier that the last one.

142
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:49,332
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.

143
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:52,830
Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?

144
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,807
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!

145
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:03,641
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...

146
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:05,764
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?

147
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:07,962
Your last roommate's kidney?

148
00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:14,798
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.

149
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:25,064
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.

150
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:29,313
Lemonade? You ok man?

151
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:33,446
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.

152
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:35,964
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?

153
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:39,014
I fell down an elevator shaft.

154
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:43,562
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.

155
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:47,769
- What?
- I used to be Bryce on All My Children.

156
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:08,162
- Daaahhhh!
- Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!

157
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:13,305
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.

158
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,090
- I wa-
- Uuuh.

159
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,315
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots,

160
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:27,671
I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.

161
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:32,033
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

162
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:34,479
- What?
- You, move out.

163
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:38,585
Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!

164
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,793
You, you want, you want me to move out?

165
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:47,568
Uh-huh.

166
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:53,553
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?

167
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:55,344
This is not out of the blue,

168
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:59,718
- this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
- Ohhhh.

169
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:04,909
Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright,

170
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,763
guess I'll be back for my stuff.

171
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:16,498
But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!

172
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:21,288
- You want some help.
- No help required Chico.

173
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:29,632
All the way to the airport huh?

174
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:34,391
You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.

175
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:37,588
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.

176
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:41,563
- What?
- Five oh dollars.

177
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:45,642
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages.

178
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:49,307
Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray,

179
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:52,355
they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.

180
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,754
That's great.

181
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:59,591
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin',

182
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:04,313
I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.

183
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:06,034
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.

184
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:11,072
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish.

185
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:20,629
Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge.

186
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:26,232
You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya.

187
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:28,669
I'll have a good day.

188
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:34,421
Ok, question number 28,

189
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:39,268
have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind?

190
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:42,834
I would have to say no.

191
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:45,826
And I would have to say pah-huh.

192
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,513
- What?
- Do you not remember the puppet guy?

193
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:54,869
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.

194
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,788
And his puppet too.

195
00:13:56,788 --> 00:14:05,907
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.

196
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:08,766
- Who?
- Paul. 
- Oh.

197
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:12,205
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question.

198
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:19,072
Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer?

199
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:21,756
- Ok, number 30.
- Woah, woah, woah,

200
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:24,291
let's go back to 29.

201
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:30,115
Not uh, not to my recollection.

202
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:32,756
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade.

203
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:35,252
Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.

204
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:38,244
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.

205
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:45,216
Listen to you two. It's so sad.

206
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:48,549
Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.

207
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:53,012
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour

208
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:56,268
after he broke up with Monica.

209
00:14:56,268 --> 00:15:01,069
- One hour?
- You are such a leaf blower.

210
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:19,607
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.

211
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:26,529
Oh my God, what's goin' on?

212
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,517
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.

213
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:33,951
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you.

214
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:37,508
I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff.

215
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:41,389
Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know.

216
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:46,001
To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that

217
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:50,882
and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.

218
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:53,366
- Thanks Ross.
- Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger.

219
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:58,754
I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.

220
00:15:58,754 --> 00:16:00,954
- I went.
- Great, how did it go?

221
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:02,467
- I didn't get it.
- Good for you.

222
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,791
- What?
- You're livin' the dream.

223
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:09,231
- Huh?
- All right then.

224
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,630
- Oh, not my parrot.
- What?

225
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,909
I can't watch this.

226
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:17,034
Hey hold on, hold on.

227
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:20,808
How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?

228
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,704
- 1200.
- Dollars?

229
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:25,749
You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?

230
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:28,753
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.

231
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:35,727
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?

232
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:38,109
- Uh, the dog.
- Huh. 
- Yeah.

233
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:46,356
I'll take it. My gift to you man.

234
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:47,827
Thanks Ross.

235
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:50,356
I really like that bird though...

236
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:53,125
I'll take the dog though.

237
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:04,267
- Here are your cakes.
- We didn't order cake.

238
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:09,607
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good.

239
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:15,030
I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.

240
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,068
- You're right.
- You know.

241
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:21,196
I love you goddesses.

242
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:24,550
I don't ever want to suck your wind again.

243
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,834
- Thank you. So are we good? 
- We're good. 
- We're good?

244
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:33,287
- Yeah.
- Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.

245
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:38,797
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.

246
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:45,150
- Are you sure this time?
- Yes, yes I actually saw him leave.

247
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,309
I mean that guy is standing in the window

248
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:51,559
holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!

249
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:56,597
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.

250
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:58,150
There is no alley behind Macy's.

251
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,277
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff.

252
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:04,678
Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?

253
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:06,761
Our next cocktail party?

254
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:12,077
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.

255
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:16,275
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?

256
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:19,716
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

257
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:26,356
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?

258
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,654
Uh, yes.

259
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:33,588
So what happened?

260
00:18:33,588 --> 00:18:35,732
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.

261
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:38,372
Oh sweet Moses.

262
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,010
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?

263
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,392
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks,

264
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,728

- Nice.
- Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.

266
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,314
Is anyone else starting to really like him?

267
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:19,266
May I help you?

268
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:22,184
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?

269
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:24,434
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh.

270
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:30,118
- Have we met?
- It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.

271

I, I'm sorry, I uh

273
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:39,540
Hello.

274
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:46,823
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.

275
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:52,928
No he, he moved out and I moved in.

276
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:55,598
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.

277
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:58,028
I know I would.

278
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:07,069
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then.

279
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,687
- I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.

Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath.

282
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:26,519
- So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
- Na, na I'm ok.

283
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,893
Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to.

284
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:36,594
Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really,

285
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:39,485
I mean, this is...

286
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:43,550
Welcome home man.

287
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:52,827
- A little foos?
- Absolutely.

288
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:56,996
What happened to the foosball?

289
00:20:56,996 --> 00:20:59,487
Ah that's a cantelope.

290
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,129
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?

291
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:09,313
He paid a lot of money for it.

292
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:18,506
I'm gonna hold him a different way.

293
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:22,873
Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?

294
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:29,392
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.

295
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:33,598
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place?

296
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:36,025
Stay.

297
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,838
Good, STAY!

298
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:45,992
Good fake dog.
