1
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:10,770
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough?
Is there something... repellant... about me?

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,951
So, how was the party?

3
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,394
Well it couldn't have been worse.

4
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:16,172
A woman literally passed through me.

5
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:18,728
OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?

6
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:21,608
No, you are not, you are very attractive.

7
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:23,700
You know what, I go through the exact same thing.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,918
Every time I put on a little weight,
I start questioning everyting.

9
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:33,709
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?

10
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:41,496
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.

11
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:44,249
Chandler, I'm unemployed and
in dire need of a project.

12
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:46,367
Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.

13
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:50,637
Oh, you know, I would, but that might
get in the way of my lying around time.

14
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:51,378
Please.

15
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:53,334
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.

16
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:59,032
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and
my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.

17
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:02,170
Your boobs are fine. Look,
I never should have said anything.

18
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,319
Come here. Come here.

19
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,151
Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....

20
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,647
OK, let's do it.

21
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:06,852
What?

22
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:12,201
Nothing, just never seen you
in little stretchy pants before.

23
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:14,319
And we're changing.

24
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,437
C'mon give me five more. / No.

25
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:33,588
Five more. / No.

26
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,739
Five more and I'll flash you.

27
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:44,759
One... two... two and a half.

28
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,475
OK, just show me one of them.

29
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:54,704
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

30
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:00,959
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

31
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:04,478
She's insane, the woman is insane.

32
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:07,228
It's before work, it's after work, it's during work.

33
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,489
She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk.

34
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,816
And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.

35
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,866
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?

36
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:22,717
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic
restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.

37
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:24,138
The guy still won't put out, huh?

38
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,725
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.

39
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,927
Sorry Phoebs.

40
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:32,298
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot,

41
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:38,795
y'know he's really interesting and he's
really sweet and why won't he give it up?

42
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:44,658
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other
side of the road, if ya know what I mean.

43
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:50,124
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.

44
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:52,087
Maybe he's... gay.

45
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:56,290
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem.

46
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,589
'Cause we went, um, dancing the other
night and the way he held me so close,

47
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:05,137
and the way he was looking into my eyes
I just like... definitely felt something.

48
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,379
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?

49
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,794
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.

50
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:16,382
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.

51
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:21,447
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.

52
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,414
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.

53
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:26,148
What?

54
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:29,095
C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.

55
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:30,724
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?

56
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:32,844
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.

57
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:35,527
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh...?

58
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:37,908
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing?

59
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:43,542
Well, y'know, as much fun as that was,
I've decided to opt for sanity.

60
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:44,958
So you really OK about all this?

61
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,914
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on.

62
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:51,282
He can press her up against that
window as much as he wants.

63
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:54,748
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.

64
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,110
Hi guys. / Hey.

65
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,541
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow
morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?

66
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,754
Only if you say his full name.

67
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:10,286
Can I come over tomorrow and
pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.

68
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:12,150
Alright.

69
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,244
You're getting a cat?

70
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:16,477
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.

71
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:17,763
Together? / Uh huh.

72
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:18,484
Both of you? / Yep.

73
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,868
Together.

74
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:22,855
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half
the time, and with me half the time.

75
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:27,545
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely.

76
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:32,675
That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy
for a really, really, really, really, really long time.

77
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:33,923
Hopefully.

78
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:38,452
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go,
I gotta date. With a man.

79
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:42,430
Um, OK, you guys have a really,
uh, have a really good night

80
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,528
and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat.

81
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:53,733
OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.

82
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:04,205
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the
first date I've gone on since my divorce so,

83
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:08,608
if I seem a little nervous, I am.

84
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:11,599
How long do cats live?

85
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,948
I'm sorry?

86
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:18,773
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't...
y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?

87
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:22,600
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.

88
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,252
That's just great.

89
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,727
Um, cheers.

90
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,372
Oh, right, clink.

91
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:39,093
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?

92
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:45,705
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you.
I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing.

93
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:51,435
It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend
of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

94
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:56,047
Oh, that does sound... Ahh.

95
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:59,624
I mean he just started going out with her.

96
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:02,117
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?

97
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:09,340
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes.

98
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,805
Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK,
Michael, let's talk about you.

99
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:14,577
Alright.

100
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:24,355
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?

101
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:26,775
So, I figured it out.

102
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:27,834
What?

103
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:32,662
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.

104
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:34,870
Phoebe, that's crazy.

105
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,796
When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler?

106
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:40,335
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

107
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:52,113
Really? That's so sweet. I mean,
I'm officially offended but, sweet.

108
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:56,479
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the
deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.

109
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,303
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.

110
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:24,515
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat.

111
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:28,592
Why can't they get one of those bugs,
y'know, one of those fruitflies,

112
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:33,203
those things that live for like a day or something?
What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?

113
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:34,653
Fruitflies?

114
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:37,407
Yes! Thank you.

115
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:38,677
So, would you like any dessert?

116
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:43,647
No! No dessert, just a check, please.

117
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:46,953
Oh, no, you're not having fun, are you?

118
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:55,205
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and
a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.

119
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:58,740
Oh, look at me, look at me.

120
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:08,879
Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can
think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie.

121
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,459
I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?

122
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:17,714
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce,
trust me you're gonna be fine.

123
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:20,586
You just can't see it now because
you haven't had any closure.

124
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:29,635
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is,
that's what I need. God, you're brilliant!

125
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,298
Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?

126
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,796
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just,

127
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:42,677
you know, whatever it takes so that you
can finally say to him, "I'm over you."

128
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:47,811
Closure, that's what it is.

129
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:49,957
Closure.

130
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:54,922
Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel... woo

131
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:55,676
Hang on.

132
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:56,527
Hello, excuse me.

133
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:57,234
What.

134
00:09:57,234 --> 00:10:02,322
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your
phone for just one minute.

135
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:03,412
I'm talkin'!

136
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:08,023
I can see that. I... just one phone call,
I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself.

137
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,620
OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.

138
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:17,680
Alright, fine.

139
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,028
I'll call you back.

140
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:24,669
Thank you.

141
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,981
Machine. Just waiting for the beep.

142
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:36,159
Good.

143
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,982
Ross, hi, it's Rachel.

144
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:48,981
I'm just calling to say that um, everything's
fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat

145
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:55,309
who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.

146
00:10:55,309 --> 00:11:01,661
And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking
of names so obviously, I am over you.

147
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:10,165
I am over you and that, my friend,
is what they call closure.

148
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:21,451
No, no, no, no, no, no

149
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:23,935
No.

150
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:26,562
Monica, it's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

151
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:27,851
Why not?

152
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,280
Because it's Sunday.

153
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,776
It's God's day.

154
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:36,178
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.

155
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:38,398
OK, stop.

156
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:42,729
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon,
we've got three more pounds to go.

157
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:50,792
I am the energy train and you are on board.
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo

158
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,589
Woo.

159
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:01,463
Hey Rach.

160
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:02,847
Ahhhh.

161
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,972
Oh. And how was the date?

162
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,675
Umm, I think there was a restaurant...

163
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,931
I know there was wine...

164
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:19,002
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting
a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say...

165
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:22,733
What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?

166
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:30,762
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream
about you last night but I, I don't remember.

167
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:32,921
OK.

168
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,084
Oh, oh, oh.

169
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:38,451
Did we speak on the phone last night?
Did you call me?

170
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:41,837
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.

171
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:42,549
Huh.

172
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:46,376
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?

173
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:47,835
Oh yeah, go ahead.

174
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,816
Rach, I got a message from you.

175
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,839
Who's Michael?

176
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:07,192
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone,
give me the phone Ross, give me the phone...

177
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,167
You're over me?

178
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,227
Ohhhhhhhh God.

179
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:21,493
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?

180
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:25,758
Ohh, ohh.

181
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:31,302
When, when were you... under me?

182
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:41,273
Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh... What?

183
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:54,274
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately,
I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.

184
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:59,417
You've had feelings for me?

185
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,678
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.

186
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:03,104
Woah. Huh.

187
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:11,366
You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?

188
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:12,063
Chandler told me.

189
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:15,057
When did he... when did he... when did he?

190
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,507
When you were in China.

191
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:19,238
China.

192
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:20,150
Meeting Julie.

193
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:29,276
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie,
right. OK, I need to lie down.

194
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:35,148
No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand,
I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing.

195
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:40,886
OK so you uh, and now wha...
and now, now, now you're over me?

196
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:46,245
Are you over me?

197
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:58,355
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie.

198
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,257
Hi Julie.

199
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:00,691
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.

200
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,114
I'll be right down.

201
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,217
Wait, so, you're going?

202
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:10,471
Well, OK, I uh, I have to.

203
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:13,191
I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh,

204
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:18,493
y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend,
I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.

205
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:20,226
OK, OK.

206
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:23,553
Cat.

207
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,084
Hey Joey.

208
00:15:40,084 --> 00:15:41,643
Hey Phoebs.

209
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:46,055
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?

210
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:49,280
I can't find the remote.

211
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,992
Thank you.

212
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,471
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.

213
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:58,464
And?

214
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:00,491
And we did.

215
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:02,421
All right Phoebs, way to go.

216
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,249
Yay me.

217
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:06,152
So, so how did it happen?

218
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:09,434
Well, I finally took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

219
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:10,331
And what did he say?

220
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:15,045
He said that, um, he understands how sex can
be like, a very emotional thing for a woman

221
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:19,348
and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all,
y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day'

222
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:22,778
and, y'know, 'where is this going'
and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la.

223
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:28,015
So he said he wanted to hold off until
he was prepared to be really serious.

224
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:28,772
Wow.

225
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:34,263
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know,

226
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:38,590
I mean, sex can be just about two
people right there in the moment,

227
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,767
y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again
he can call and if not, that's fine too.

228
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:48,004
So after a looooot of talking...

229
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:51,377
I convinced him.

230
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:58,317
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sleep with him,

231
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,964
he got you to say he never has to call you again,

232
00:17:01,964 --> 00:17:06,640
and he got you thinking this was a great idea.

233
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,927
Um-hum.

234
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:11,855
This man is my God.

235
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:31,902
I didn't get a cat.

236
00:17:31,902 --> 00:17:34,965
Oh, that's um, interesting.

237
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:39,274
No, no it's not interesting.
OK, it's very, very not interesting.

238
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:42,108
In fact it's actually 100 percent
completely opposite of interesting.

239
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,366
Alright, I got it Ross.

240
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:46,531
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.

241
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:47,444
What?

242
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:49,829
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.

243
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:54,336
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you.
You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?

244
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,618
Then you should have said
something before I met her.

245
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:00,109
I didn't know then. And how come
you never said anything to me.

246
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:01,625
There was never a good time.

247
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,953
Right, you, you only had a year.
We only hung out every night.

248
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:09,538
Not, not, not every night.

249
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:11,617
You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel,

250
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:13,339
but things got in the way, y'know?

251
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:20,569
Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances
or, or, or Italian guys.

252
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:25,972
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK,
and do you even have a point?

253
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:29,013
The point is I... I don't need this right now,

254
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:32,115
OK. It, it's too late, I'm with
somebody else, I'm happy.

255
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:33,757
This ship has sailed.

256
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:36,868
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away
feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?

257
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:39,527
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade,
I've gotten pretty damn good at it.

258
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:42,088
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you
do that, alright Ross. / Fine.

259
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,619
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.

260
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:45,570
Good. / Good.

261
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:49,082
And ya know what, now I've got closure.

262
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:41,459
Try the bottom one.

263
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:15,344
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.
We're not working out, it's over.

264
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:22,444
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin',
we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.

265
00:20:22,444 --> 00:20:28,073
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound.
OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound.

266
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:31,242
OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.

267
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:38,047
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?

268
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:42,765
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

269
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:44,367
Well, thanks.

270
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:48,941
I mean, especially considering how
tough it's been for you to find work.

271
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,764
Well, you know.

272
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:57,308
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents
you were fired because they'd be disappointed.

273
00:20:57,308 --> 00:20:59,035
Uh-huh.

274
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:04,590
And it's not as if you have a
boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

275
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,857
Well no, but um.

276
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:11,454
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have
difficulty just getting out of bed at all.

277
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,819
Y'know, I try to stay positive...

278
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:24,198
So, you feel like goin' for a run?

279
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:27,339
Alright.

280
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:34,138
Because, you know, you don't have to.
If you want, you could just take a nap right here.

281
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:37,819
OK. Just for a little while.

282
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:40,444
OK.
