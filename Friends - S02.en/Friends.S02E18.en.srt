1
00:00:01,497 --> 00:00:02,868
Oh Drake.

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:07,279
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,407
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?

4
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:10,913
We, we just wanna see the end.

5
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:13,524
- I want you Drake.
- I know you do

6
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:16,156
but you and I can never be together that way.

7
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:17,274
What?

8
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:21,141
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually

9
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,884
your half- brother.

10
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:28,593
So what happens next?

11
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:32,309
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins.

12
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,866
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone.

13
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:41,747
And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big

14
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:45,037
but it's cursed.

15
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:48,739
God that is good TV.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,000

Season 218. The One Where Dr. Remore Dies

17
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:37,311
- Phoebs, play with meeee.
- No.

18
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,883
This game is grotesque.

19
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:42,785
Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar,

20
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:46,333
forced to play soccer forever.

21
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,201
Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.

22
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,190
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em.

23
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,752
After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.

24
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:59,004
Why don't you play with your roommate?

25
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:03,224
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.

26
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,273
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?

27
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:09,355
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.

28
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:13,789
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?

29
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:16,878
- We don't need to remedy that.
- Oh yeah, it'll be fun.

30
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,210
What was that?

31
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,829
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.

32
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,593
- Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
- Oh good, ok.

33
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:33,152
Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um,

34
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:36,705
Green Eggs and Ham discussion group.

35
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:40,568
Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train.

36
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:41,967
Have fun bye.

37
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:45,084
- That was so lame.
- I know, yeah.

38
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:47,130
Ok, talk to him.

39
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:55,727
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?

40
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,827
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?

41
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:01,677
What're you kidding? I broke up with her.

42
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:05,535
She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.

43
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:10,876
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...

44
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:14,474
- Well it's not Sean Penn.
- Not Sean Penn.

45
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:18,348
Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly.

46
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:22,083
Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right.

47
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:26,869
And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' 
I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.'

48
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:31,330
And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and

49
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:41,175
smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, andI'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop.

50
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:48,591
That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?

51
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,688
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and

52
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:59,487
the rest of the rats played moroccas.

53
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:02,726
That's it, thanks, good night.

54
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:05,991
Phoebe's got another job, right?

55
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:10,682
- Great set tonight Phoebs.
- I know.

56
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,481
Well, we should probably get going.

57
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:15,033
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.

58
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,870
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment?

59
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,532
Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.

60
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:24,074
I don't know, I don't have my jammies.

61
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:25,930
Well, maybe you don't need them.

62
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,072
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

63
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,879
Shut up, I'm happy.

64
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:36,507
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech.

65
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:42,029
I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot,

66
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,752
I like you the best.

67
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,554
- Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
- Ok.

68
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,120
Hear that? She likes me best,

69
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,310
and apparently there've been a lot.

70
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,646
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.

71
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:02,592
Phoebe's dead.

72
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,316
- Hi.
- Hi.

73
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:11,648
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.

74
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,948
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler,

75
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:16,677
can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?

76
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:20,003
- Thanks.
- Oh, oh, c'mon in.

77
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:23,187
- I'm Tilly.
- Oh.

78
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:30,073
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.

79
00:05:30,073 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.

80
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,111
He's kind of intense huh?

81
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:42,107
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...

82
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,110
A little what?

83
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,829
Bit country?

84
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:49,915
C'mon in here you roomie.

85
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,471
Hello Tilly.

86
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:54,345
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.

87
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:58,273
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.

88
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:05,547
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go.

89
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:06,715
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

90
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,833
Bye.

91
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,995
So, we gettin' a fish?

92
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:14,512
You had sex with her didn't you?

93
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,548
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.

94
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:24,361
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.

95
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:28,184
- Page 42, page 42, page 42.
- Ok, ok, ok.

96
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:32,617
Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.'

97
00:06:32,617 --> 00:06:34,913
Ooh, cool picture.

98
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:37,965
Ooh, I look good.

99
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:42,203
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?

100
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:47,641
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident?

101
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:53,025
Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.'

102
00:06:53,025 --> 00:07:00,227
But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'

103
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:03,767
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there.

104
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:10,755
Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?

105
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:17,713
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house.

106
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:19,316
But you know what?

107
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:22,924
This makes me look good, which makes the show look good,

108
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:26,714
which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?

109
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:32,195
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-.

110
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:35,886
Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.

111
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:37,947
I fall down an elevator shaft?

112
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:41,149
What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?

113
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:45,469
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.

114
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:49,154
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.

115
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:51,509
Right.

116
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:53,071
Could you sign this?

117
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,204
No. No way, I'm not signing that.

118
00:07:56,204 --> 00:08:00,031
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.

119
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,191
How can they do this to me?

120
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:08,274
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go.

121
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:10,144
Sorry.

122
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,749
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are,

123
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:23,233
it's a very small percentage.

124
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:26,074
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.

125
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:27,944
- G'night.
- Night Richard.

126
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:29,916
Good luck Mon.

127
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:35,050
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.

128
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:37,444
Two.

129
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:40,425
Two? TWO?

130
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:45,789
How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?

131
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:48,713
Well, I mean what can I say?

132
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:52,440
I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart,

133
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,989
now you, that's two.

134
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:57,635
Two it is.

135
00:08:57,635 --> 00:09:00,851
Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.

136
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:06,551
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon.

137
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:12,151
Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.

138
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:16,388
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.

139
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,448
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.

140
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:27,427
- Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
- Uhhhooo.

141
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:33,923
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.

142
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:40,646
- Well, there's you.
- Better not be doin' these in order.

143
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:48,684
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.

144
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:52,925
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.

145
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,084
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

146
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:59,779
Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.

147
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,123
- Really?
- Oh please.

148
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:05,192
That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.

149
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:10,273
All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex.

150
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:18,164
Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.

151
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,394
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.

152
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:23,909
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.

153
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:29,505
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.

154
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,072
- Where's Buddy?
- Buddy?

155
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,485
My fish, Buddy.

156
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:36,803
There was no fish when she dropped it off.

157
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,119
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable.

158
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:43,946
I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it

159
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:46,328
and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?

160
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:50,790
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...

161
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,922
Would you look at what I'm doin' here.

162
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:59,441
That can't be smart.

163
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:06,321
So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

164
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:11,130
Tangellon?

165
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,471
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?

166
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,651
Well yeah.

167
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:28,684
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.

168
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:30,713
You really ok with it?

169
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:32,035
Oh honey, I'm fine.

170
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:34,267
Oh, yay.

171
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:38,234
Ok about that two.

172
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:39,612
What?

173
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:42,651
Alright, what about my two?

174
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:45,299
Well, it just seems like a really small number.

175
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:48,074
Right, and...

176
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:52,564
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew?

177
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:57,677
Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?

178
00:11:57,677 --> 00:12:00,692
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I,

179
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,392
I guess I'm just not an oat guy.

180
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:05,851
I've only slept with women I've been in love with.

181
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:10,672
But you've only slept with two people.

182
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,520
Right.

183
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,870
Wow. Oh wow.

184
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,602
You know I love you too, right.

185
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:25,666
Now I do.

186
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:33,233
Ross, Ross, please listen to me.

187
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:36,708
Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was.

188
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:40,306
I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.

189
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,644
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea,

190
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:46,732
why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.

191
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:50,834
God, Ross,

192
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:54,151
look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...

193
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:57,292
Animal sex, animal sex?

194
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:03,237
So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all.

195
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:09,070
I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like,

196
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,724
like chipmunk sex?

197
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:17,665
Ok, Ross, try to hear me.

198
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:21,122
Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.

199
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:24,999
- Knock-knock.
- But,

200
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:28,212
what you and I have is so much better.

201
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:32,767
Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.

202
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:40,278
Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.

203
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,125
Until now.

204
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:49,406
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

205
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:51,149
Richard just told me he loves me.

206
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:52,473
- Oh my God, 
- I know.

207
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:55,040
honey that's great.

208
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:58,466
- I just can't find...
- Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.

209
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:01,752
- You need one too?
- Ooooh

210
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:04,354
yeah.

211
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,607
There's only one.

212
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,747
Monica.

213
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:16,717
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.

214
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,317
Rachel.

215
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:32,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

216
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,754
- They're just trying to decide somehting.
- Good, good, good.

217
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:48,545
So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?

218
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:50,770
- No.
- Oh.

219
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,868
How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?

220
00:14:57,868 --> 00:15:00,471
- I have a little comb.
- Oh.

221
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:04,311
And what do you call that?

222
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:07,383
- A moustache comb.

223
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,988
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.

224
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:14,322
- No.
- Ok, ok, ok,

225
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:16,316
I will, I will,

226
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,776
I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.

227
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:24,045
- Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
- Agghhh.

228
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:35,666
So were you in Nam?

229
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,505
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Yeah.

230
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:43,234
One two three.

231
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,551
Yeesss.

232
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:49,149
- Fine, go have sex.

233
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,074
No. You have got it completely wrong.

234
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:57,796
John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.

235
00:15:57,796 --> 00:16:01,466
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend.

236
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:06,792
- John Voit was...
- Honey. 
- What, what oh....

237
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:15,068
- Shall we?
- It's not gonna happen.

238
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:18,954
They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.

239
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:24,648
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...

240
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:33,358
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.

241
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:34,251
Why?

242
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:38,090
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

243
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,750
Why would you kill his fish?

244
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:46,154
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone,

245
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:50,202
you have to kill the fish.

246
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:53,183
Chandler honey, I'm sorry.

247
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:55,367
Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?

248
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,268
- Yeah.
- Wait, he's not here yet.

249
00:16:57,268 --> 00:17:00,707
- So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
- Yeah. 
- Alright.

250
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,649
- Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
- Oh good.

251
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:10,624
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you,

252
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:13,475
as a friend and as your brother.

253
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:15,438
Oh Drake.

254
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:19,711
Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.

255
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:23,148
Some guys are just lucky I guess.

256
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:28,245
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.

257
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:34,491
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me.

258
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:38,676
Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?

259
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:43,025
No, no, they only said you.

260
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,947
Oh, ok. Alright.

261
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,432
I love you Drake.

262
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:49,664
Yeah, whatever.

263
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:52,970
- Oh no.
- Drake, look out. 
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

264
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,686
- Did they just kill off Joey?
- No.

265
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:03,673
Now maybe.

266
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,182
- C'mon.
- Joey. 
Open up. We want to talk to you.

267
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:08,871
I don't feel like talkin.

268
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:12,479
- Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
- We're worried about you.

269
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:15,972
And some of us really have to pee.

270
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:22,361
- Sorry Joey.
- Hey.

271
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:26,470
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.

272
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,237
We came over as soon as we saw.

273
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:29,811
How could you not tell us?

274
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:34,709
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.

275
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:37,525
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.

276
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:43,390
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that

277
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,083
the only doctor that could have saved me was me.

278
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,471
Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.

279
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:57,394
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.

280
00:18:57,394 --> 00:19:00,798
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

281
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,584
Yes, I was going to incorporate that.

282
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,431
Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.

283
00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:13,867
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew.

284
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:16,828
What? To me that's nice.

285
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:19,289
It's gonna be ok. You know that?

286
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:25,596
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and

287
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:30,435
you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be.

288
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:34,356
But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything.

289
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:41,108
Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved.

290
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:45,551
Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.

291
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,433
I'm sorry man.

292
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:54,666
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.

293
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,829
No, that means nothin to me.

294
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:02,691
Uhhhaahh.

295
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:06,029
Pecan sandy, just made em.

296
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:09,131
Yeah alright.

297
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:11,510
What're these, raisins?

298
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,223
Uh, sure, why not.

299
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:25,513
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh,

300
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:26,882
why are you smiling?

301
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:30,722
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie.

302
00:20:30,722 --> 00:20:35,268
I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.

303
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:47,187
Well that's not an, even a real fish.

304
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:51,444
No, that's a goldfish cracker.

305
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:55,991
