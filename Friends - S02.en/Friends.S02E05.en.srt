1
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:08,849
Man, I sure miss Julie.

2
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,206
Spanish midgets.

3
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:17,522
Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie.
Ok, yes, I see how you got there.

4
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,165
You ever figure out what that thing's for?

5
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:27,924
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing.

6
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,994
You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone,
people'll think I don't have a life.

7
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:34,632
My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.

8
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,868
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.

9
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:40,094
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane.

10
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:45,355
I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was
just thinking about us, and how great it was,

11
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:50,451
and, well, I know it's been three years, but,
I was kinda hoping we could hook up again.

12
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:54,403
You know, I barely had t he nerve to
make this call, so you know what I did?

13
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:55,695
What?

14
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:58,933
I got a little drunk... and naked.

15
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,561
Bob here.

16
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:50,326
So ah... What've you been up to?

17
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:56,894
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching
aerobics, partying way too much.

18
00:01:56,894 --> 00:02:05,347
Oh, and in case you were wondering, those
are my legs on the new James Bond poster.

19
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,366
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.

20
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,759
I know.

21
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,473
I'm back.

22
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,710
So, are we gonna get together or what?

23
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,902
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon?
Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?

24
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:21,734
Great, I'll see you then.

25
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:30,418
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.

26
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:33,000
Even though you do do a good Bob impression,

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,808
I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's
probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."

28
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:45,163
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek
comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.

29
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:49,277
Oh my god. You are pure evil.

30
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:56,036
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone.

31
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:57,595
I've done this.

32
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:08,934
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey,
everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.

33
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:10,386
Hi, Julie!

34
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:13,520
Hi, Julie.

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,071
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody
owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.

36
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:23,717
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up?

37
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:27,311
You know, like from, like 20?

38
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:30,135
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.

39
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:33,389
Do we need a cake?

40
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:34,988
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.

41
00:03:34,988 --> 00:03:38,033
Yeah, whoosh!

42
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,750
But it's Ross.

43
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,631
It's Ross.

44
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:43,708
All right.

45
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,674
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go... do a thing.

46
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:50,201
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight.

47
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,373
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're 
not really gonna go through with this, are you?

48
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:55,597
You know, I think I might just.

49
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:01,745
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?

50
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:05,827
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday,

51
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:08,950
so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.

52
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,371
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?

53
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:14,491
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um,

54
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:19,202
Chandler and those guys just don't get that
we don't make as much money as they do?

55
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:23,391
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying
"let's go here, let's go there".

56
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:26,867
Like we can afford to go here and there.

57
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,990
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice, you know?

58
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,368
God, and it's not like we can say anything about it,
'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.

59
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:41,234
For Ross. 
For Ross, Ross, Ross.

60
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:44,074
Oh my god. 
Hey. 
Hi. 
What?

61
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:49,950
Ok, I'm at work, ordinary day, you know,
chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.

62
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,744
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

63
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:55,941
It turns out they fired the head lunch chef,
and guess who got the job.

64
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:59,833
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.

65
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:06,841
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me
head of purchasing, thank you very much.

66
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:11,348
Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs,and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.

67
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,815
Yeah, someplace nice.

68
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:20,678
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?

69
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,596
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.

70
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:33,574
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like
that with conventional methods.

71
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:36,395
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob.

72
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:39,770
Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with.

73
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,548
You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.

74
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:49,451
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me.
We like me. Please let me be happy.

75
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:53,636
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.

76
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,228
All right.

77
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:57,413
Go.

78
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:05,687
Hi.

79
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:07,708
Hi.

80
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,923
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to,
I have to confess something.

81
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:15,360
Yes?

82
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,090
Whoever stood you up is a jerk. 
How did you--?

83
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,680
I don't know.

84
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,839
I just had this weird sense. You know,
but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive.

85
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,230
Tissue?

86
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,528
Thanks.

87
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,494
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.

88
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:57,064
Ok, ok, here is to my sister,
the newly-appointed head lunch chef--

89
00:06:57,064 --> 00:06:59,079
Who is also in charge of purchasing.

90
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,180
Newly appointed head lunch chef whois also in charge of purchasing--

91
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,914
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.

92
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:09,828
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing,
own little desk when Roland's not there.

93
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:10,906
Here's to my little sister--

94
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:13,268
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!

95
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:16,132
Cool. 
Let's see!

96
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:20,134
That's fine, I'll just wait! 
Oh, sorry. 
Sorry, sorry.

97
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,087
Monica!

98
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:26,364
Are we ready to order?

99
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,308
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.

100
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:32,307
Well, when you do, just let me know.
I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.

101
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:43,035
Wow, look at these prices.

Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.

102
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:45,558
What are these, like famous chickens?

103
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,050
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.

104
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible
was my afternoon with Jade?

105
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,055
Well, pretty incredible according to the
message she left you on my machine.

106
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:02,429
Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving
a message for you on my machine?

107
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,586
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number,

108
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:09,155
because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number
because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.

109
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:13,681
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

110
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,883
Do I dare ask?

111
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:20,332
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and
then I'll have the grilled prawns.

112
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:23,439
That sounds great. Same for me.

And for the gentleman?

113
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,589
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

114
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:30,802
But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts
and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

115
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,455
You'd think, wouldn't you?

116
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:34,361
Miss?

117
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:39,032
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.

118
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:41,987
And what will that be on the side of?

119
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:48,517
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put
it right here next to my water?

120
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:50,506
And for you?

121
00:08:50,506 --> 00:09:01,723
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumbersoup, and, um, take care.

122
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:04,026
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.

123
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,161
Anything else?

124
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:09,557
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly.

125
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:11,579
You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?

126
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:21,210
Plus tip, divided by six.

127
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,014
Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.

128
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,975
Um, everyone?

129
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:30,520
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. 
Thank you.

130
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,548
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.

Oh, thank you!

131
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:38,866
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.

132
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:41,638
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.

133
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:46,554
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.

134
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:52,802
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted,
but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks?

135
00:09:52,802 --> 00:10:01,050
No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad,
and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...

136
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:07,757
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just
pay for what we had. It's no big deal.

137
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:08,701
Not for you.

138
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,189
All right, what's goin' on?

139
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:19,358
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. Ithink it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.

140
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:23,282
Fine. All right, fine. 
Yeah. 
You can tell us.

141
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:26,390
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.

142
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:53,516
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get thatuh, we don't have as much money as you.

143
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:56,067
Ok. 
I hear ya.

144
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:59,037
We can talk about that.

145
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:04,636
Well, then... Let's.

146
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:09,931
Well, um... I, I, yes, I just never think of money as an issue.

147
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:14,327
That's 'cause you have it.

That's a good point.

148
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:18,118
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?

149
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:25,535
Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's
new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.

150
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:30,726
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday
to be the source of any kind of negative--

151
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:34,788
there's gonna be a hoopla?

152
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:40,189
Basically, there's the thing, and then
there's the stuff after the thing.

153
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:45,277
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can
just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.

154
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:48,747
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?

155
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:51,636
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

156
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:56,470
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.

157
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,683
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.

158
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:05,280
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the
important thing is that we all be together.

159
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,530
All of us. 
Together.

160
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,138
Not at the concert.

161
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:13,102
Ok. 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
Thanks. 
Yeah.

162
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:22,251
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?

163
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,383
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?

164
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:32,363
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.

165
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:33,934
Oh, it's like a skit.

166
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:42,196
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.

Whoo! 
Cool.

167
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:46,254
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the
new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.

168
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:52,440
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler,
what is in the envelope?

169
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,591
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.

Come on.

170
00:12:56,591 --> 00:13:02,313
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish!

171
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:05,694
The Blowfish!

172
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:09,907
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.

173
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:14,841
So... Thank you.

174
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,763
Could you be less enthused?

175
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:21,446
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--

176
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,324
Like?

177
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,603
Charity. 
Charity?

178
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:28,254
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.

179
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:32,124
Ross, you have to understand that
your nice thing makes us feel this big.

180
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:36,228
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

181
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:40,912
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you,
it's like we can't win with you guys.

182
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:46,560
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not
our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.

183
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,270
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.

184
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,802
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.

185
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:57,921
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause
I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.

186
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:03,516
Me neither. 
Me too.

187
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:05,649
Guys, we bought the tickets.

188
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:10,230
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats,
you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.

189
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,355
Why did you look at me when you said that?

190
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,600
Well, I guess now we can't go.

191
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,725
What? Come on, you do what you want to do.
Do we always have to do everything together?

192
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:30,617
You know what? You're right. 
Fine.

Fine. 
Fine. 
Fine. 
Fine.

193
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:34,432
All right. We're gonna go.

194
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,987
It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.

195
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:53,428
Chandler! 
Yeah? 
Geez!

196
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:54,158
Are you ready?

197
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,529
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and
tell you I had sex today.

198
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:02,843
Whoa! You had sex today?

199
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:06,804
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it.

200
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:11,387
I was awesome, ok? She was biting
her lip to stop from screaming.

201
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:12,668
Wow.

202
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:15,195
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.

203
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,767
Still doing the screening thing?

204
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:28,474
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.

205
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:31,074
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.

206
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:36,707
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you
that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day,

207
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:41,508
and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.

208
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,668
Bob here. 
Oh, hi.

209
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,755
So, uh, you met someone, huh?

210
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:51,648
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.

211
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,386
So, uh, how was he?

212
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,112
Eh.

213
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:07,334
Eh?

214
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:13,271
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you.

215
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:18,911
I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.

216
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:22,629
Well, that makes me feel so good.

217
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,476
It was just so awkward and bumpy. 
Bumpy?

218
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:31,228
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new,
cool style, that you're not familiar with.

219
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:32,882
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.

220
00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:36,596
Well there really wasn't much time to get
used to it, you know what I mean?

221
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,748
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

222
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:53,716
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.

223
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:54,930
So, let's go.

224
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,919
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.

225
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,795
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.

226
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:09,002
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.

227
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:15,004
Come on you guys, one more time.

228
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:19,149
Ok. One. 
Nooo.

229
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:31,434
That was amazing! 
Excellent, that was excellent.

I can't believe the guys missed this.

230
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:35,117
What guys? Oh, yeah.

231
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:38,001
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?

232
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:38,910
Do I know you?

233
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,032
You used to be my babysitter.

234
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:45,128
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?

235
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,158
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.

236
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:50,022
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.

237
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:52,467
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.

238
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:55,554
Uh, wait, backstage? 
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.

239
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:57,913
Ross. 
Chandler.

240
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:01,668
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group?

241
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:05,398
Come on. So, are you one of the ones
who fooled around with my dad?

242
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,311
Hey, you guys. 
Happy birthday.

243
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:20,171
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?

244
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:23,833
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?

245
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:28,277
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did
run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?

246
00:18:28,277 --> 00:18:31,774
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?

247
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:35,560
Uh, good.

248
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,014
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening
was pretty much a bust.

249
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:41,530
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

250
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,481
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.

251
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:52,351
We just have to really, really, really, not let
stuff like money get--is that a hickey?

252
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,627
No, I just, I fell down.

253
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:04,529
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?

254
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:06,807
You know, a party, or-- 
What party?

255
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:17,954
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people,
with food, and music, and, and the band.

256
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:20,468
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?

257
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:24,362
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.

258
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,668
Who gave you that hickey?

259
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:31,088
That would be the work of a Blowfish. 
Oh!

260
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:35,115
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this.

261
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:39,560
We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers,

262
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:46,953
and you guys are out like partying and having fun,
and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".

263
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:52,547
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.

264
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:57,835
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?

265
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,061
It's work.

266
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:02,440
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that
we make more money than you.

267
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,914
But we're not gonna feel guilty about it.
We work really hard for it.

268
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,436
And we don't work hard?

269
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:09,233
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.

270
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:13,758
I'm just saying that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

271
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:15,288
And you feel like we hold you back.

272
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,764
Yes. 
Oh! 
No.

273
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:27,991
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand.
Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor.

274
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:35,654
That was not a kick back. I'll just replace
them and we can forget the whole thing.

275
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:45,469
What corporate policy? No. Yeah. OK.

276
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,189
I just got fired.

277
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:53,909
Oh.

278
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:00,654
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.

279
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:06,673
You got five bucks?

280
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,786
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.

281
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:24,786
Hi, it's me.

282
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:27,345
Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.

283
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:31,968
I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're
probably seeing someone else now,

284
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:39,330
but if we could just have one night together, just for
old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
