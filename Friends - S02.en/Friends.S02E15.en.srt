1
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:03,957
Alright, no peeking.

2
00:00:03,957 --> 00:00:07,305
No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.

3
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:13,157
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

4
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:19,955
Alright open your eyes.

5
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:23,876
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.

6
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:25,565
Huh? "Days of our Lives" picked up my option.

7
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:29,001
- Congratulations!
- I know.

8
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:34,876
- Now we can finally watch "Green Acres" the way it was meant to be seen.
- Uh-huh.

9
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,606
So uh, which one is mine?

10
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:41,199
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want.

11
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:46,643
Not that one.

12
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:49,114
Ohh yes.

13
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:54,608
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.

14
00:00:54,608 --> 00:00:59,930
- Do we dare?
- We dare.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
F r i e n d s
Season 215.The One Where Ross And Rachel...You Know

16
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:56,393
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.

17
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:59,039
Well they were chair-shaped cows.

18
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,344
They never would have survived in the wild.

19
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:08,706
- This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
- Woah!

20
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:12,505
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?

21
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:15,529
- Hi you guys.
- Hey.

22
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:18,708
- Hey you.
- Hey you.

23
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,208
Woah, hey, yo.

24
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:26,835
- So, uh, how was your day?
- Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh,

25
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:28,885
sun shining, birds chirping.

26
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:30,150
Really? Mine too.

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,792
Hey cool, mine too.

28
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:39,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.

29
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,886
OK.

30
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:49,868
- Bye guys.
- Bye.

31
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:51,231
Tonight?

32
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:53,792
Hey, yo.

33
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:56,517
- What's tonight?
- It is our first official date.

34
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:59,680
Our first date.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,675
Uh, hello.

36
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:04,441
Hi.

37
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:09,553
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?

38
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:12,711
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.

39
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:14,311
Yes but my mom got me this job.

40
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,392
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.

41
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:19,549
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.

42
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,071
Really Phoebs?

43
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:25,391
Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.

44
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,491
I can be a waitress. OK watch this.

45
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:35,551
Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.

46
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:50,160
It's James Bond.

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,770
- Sorry we're late.
- Ah, that's OK, come on in.

48
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,556
Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.

49
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:58,465
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.

50
00:03:58,465 --> 00:04:00,025
Monica?

51
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,986
My God you used to be so. . .

52
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:07,875
I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . .

53
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,846
- You look great.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:13,107
This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.

55
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:16,550
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you.

56
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,394
- So, how ya been?
- I've been great, just great. How have you been?

57
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:26,425
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.

58
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:27,437
The head tilt?

59
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:31,889
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt.

60
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,715
'How ya doin'? You OK?'

61
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,874
- I'm sorry.
- No no, it, it's fine, believe me.

62
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:40,490
I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob.

63
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,394
'I'm OK.'

64
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:46,433
'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.'

65
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,400
Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer,

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,753
of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.

67
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,552
Oh, that's too bad.

68
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:58,271
I'll survive.

69
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:03,594
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both.

70
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:08,111
But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19,

71
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:15,844
ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK.

72
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:19,513
If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you.

73
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:22,951
OK, thanks.

74
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:27,392
Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

75
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:29,000
What if we have to pee?

76
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:34,838
I'll cancel the sodas.

77
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,598
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.

78
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,837
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.

79
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:45,224
You're an opthamologist.

80
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:48,929
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.

81
00:05:50,677 --> 00:05:54,224
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it,

82
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:56,836
you stay out there.

83
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:57,874
See.

84
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:02,594
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.

85
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:05,011
OK.

86
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:06,517
You better.

87
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,809
Oh God, here we go.

88
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:12,636
Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this.

89
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:16,651
Who needs glasses?

90
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:24,993
- You are so smitten.
- I am not.

91
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:28,876
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten.

92
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:31,351
- You should ask him out.
- Dr. Burke?

93
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:35,879
I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.

94
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,670
So. You two are totally into each other.

95
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,878
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.

96
00:06:42,878 --> 00:06:45,904
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?

97
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:52,122
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.

98
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:53,994
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?

99
00:06:53,994 --> 00:07:00,889
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.

100
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:10,555
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.

101
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,999
- I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
- I know,

102
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:21,085
I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.

103
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,678
Monica.

104
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:35,712
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.

105
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:37,994
- Honey, I'm just checking.
- Oh.

106
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,236
- Monica.
- Mon.

107
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:40,907
- Monica.
- Mon.

108
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:46,040
Monica.

109
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:11,473
What,

110
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,347
- what.
- I'm sorry.

111
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:16,720
Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt,

112
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,873
it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt.

113
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:21,436
Sorry.

114
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:24,750
And that's, that's funny why?

115
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,706
Well it's not,

116
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,957
honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous.

117
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:36,184
I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.

118
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:42,678
- I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
- OK.

119
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:54,997
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.

120
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:56,469
I know, I know, I know, I know.

121
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,611
I was just thinking about when they were there the last time,

122
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:04,685
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore.

123
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:08,471
- OK put your hands back there.
- No see now, now I can't because uh,

124
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:12,363
- I'm feeling too self conscious.
- Just one cheek.

125
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,225
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.

126
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:17,165
- Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
- That's romantic.

127
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,116
- C'mon touch it.
- No.

128
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:20,235
- Oh, come on squeeze it.
- No.

129
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:21,551
- Rub it.
- No.

130
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,759
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.

131
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,510
Wow, look at that.

132
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:43,385
The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.

133
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:47,363
You got a Cheeto on your face man.

134
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:56,348
- Hi.
- Hey.

135
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:59,110
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?

136
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,588
That was 14 hours ago.

137
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:05,113
So how'd it go?

138
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:11,675
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?

139
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,251
Yeah, but uh,

140
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:18,711
it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.

141
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,569
- She laughed at you?
- Yeah.

142
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,395
I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know.

143
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:29,669
And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . .

144
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:36,083
why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?

145
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,519
- It's the Miracle Wax.
- It certainly is a miracle.

146
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,483
- Hi you guys.
- Hey.

147
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:44,150
- Hey.
- Hi.

148
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,036
Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .

149
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:49,589
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.

150
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:58,190
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.

151
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,885
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?

152
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:10,552
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh,

153
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:16,670
maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.

154
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,040
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.

155
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,205
- What's this.
- Could you get us a couple of beers?

156
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:39,723
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

157
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:41,835
Really.

158
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,808

164
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,785
Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.

165
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:17,870
Good, they feel good, in my head.

166
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,197

- Hey, woah, hey, woah.

176
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:11,387
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.

177
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:15,000
No, inside good,

178
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,996
outside bad.

179
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:20,905
You guys are so pathetic,

180
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:25,481

181
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:29,043

Goodnight.

185
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,079
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.

186
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:43,436

00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,394
Stop sending food to our apartment.

189
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:57,761
Well, why're you all dressed up?

190
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,794
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.

191
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:01,366
What? You have a date? Who with?

192
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,873
- No one.
- C'mon, what's his name?

193
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:07,473
- Nothing.
- Come on, tell me.

194
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:10,717
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK,

195
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,472
so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.

196
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:16,033
- Oh, I promise, what.
- It's Richard Burke.

197
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:19,760
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke?

198
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,684
You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why

199
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:25,729
should that bother me?

200
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:30,672
I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.

201
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:35,672
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.

202
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:40,146
- Doctor Burke is sexy?
- Oh God, absolutely.

203
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:46,389
It's the museum again, can I, oh.

204
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,946
- Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
- When?

205
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:53,553
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and

206
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:57,144
to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.

207
00:14:57,144 --> 00:15:00,305
- Oh you are so lucky.
- I know.

208
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:03,506
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display.

209
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:07,443
No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect,

210
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:09,837
australopithicus was never fully erect.

211
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:13,515
Well maybe he was nervous.

212
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:21,393
Oh look, I can't believe this.

213
00:15:21,393 --> 00:15:26,121
Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots.

214
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,234
Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave?

215
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:32,075
I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I,

216
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:34,674
I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.

217
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:37,523
- It's OK, it's fine.
- KARL!

218
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:56,274
- Wow, is that Michelle?
- Yep.

219
00:15:56,274 --> 00:16:00,606
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . .

220
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:05,359
motional.

221
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:09,395
- Ya know, she's having another baby.
- I thought she just had one.

222
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:15,957
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here.

223
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:19,915
You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa.

224
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:24,124
Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .

225
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:28,650
Oh, you're a grandpa.

226
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,125
Yeah.

227
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,474
Are we nuts here?

228
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:41,527
I don't know, maybe.

229
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:45,607
I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.

230
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:48,628
I didn't need to know that.

231
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:51,426
I guess 21 years is a lot.

232
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:57,145
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.

233
00:16:57,145 --> 00:17:00,714
Yeah.

234
00:17:00,714 --> 00:17:04,043
So.

235
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:09,264
- So maybe we should just. . .
- Yeah, yeah,

236
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,584

237
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:25,557
- Wow, this really sucks.
- Yeah, it sure does.

238
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,993
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?

239
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:47,434
No, no, there's no rush or anything.

240
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,772
- Pizza delivery.
- Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.

241
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,239
- Rach.
- Oh.

242
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,753

Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.

244
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:03,794
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.

245
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:07,395
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?

246
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:08,912
No, no, we won't.

247
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:10,915
We won't?

248
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:13,034
C'mon.

249
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:14,277
OK, that's dead right?

250
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:19,155
What is this? What are we doing?

251
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:22,322
- Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
- Grape.

252
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,406
OK, now, sit.

253
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:31,473
OK.

254
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:34,711
Oh, God.

255
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:48,674
Ah, so what are we looking at?

256
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:55,447
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.

257
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:58,712
- Really?
- I've no idea, could be.

258
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,565
Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.

259
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:09,045
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait,

260
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:12,068
and I don't just mean tonight.

261
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,628
You're not laughing.

262
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,587
This time it's not so funny.

263
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,840
Ah, oh God.

264
00:19:56,143 --> 00:20:02,771
Oh, honey, oh that's OK.

265
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:05,062
What.

266
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:09,631
Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.

267
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:19,314
Oh, thank God.

268
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,433
Hi.

269
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:50,592
Hi you.

270
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,391
I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.

271
00:20:56,391 --> 00:20:59,687
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.

272
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:06,389
- What?
- We're not alone.

273
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:30,870
Is that the fire alarm?

274
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,879
Yeah.

275
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:39,242
Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.

276
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:41,995
Cool.
