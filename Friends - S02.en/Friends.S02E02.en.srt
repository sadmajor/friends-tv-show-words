250
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:18,059
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive,and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like,20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.

251
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,142
Oh, look at these!

252
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:23,830
Hey, Ben. Just do it.

253
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,595
Oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?

254
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:30,956
Oh, is he hungry already?

255
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:33,778
I guess so.

256
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:37,898
You know, it's...

257
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:41,503
something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.

258
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:46,511
I gotta get one, too.

259
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:48,515
What are you guys doing?

260
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,883
We're just hanging out by the spoons.
Ladle?

261
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,400
Look, would you guys grow up?

262
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,090
That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.

263
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,658
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.

264
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:05,698
This is my son having lunch, ok?

265
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,362
It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it.

266
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:09,288
Now if you have any problem with it,

267
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:11,228
if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions.

268
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:15,668
Carol's fine with it, now come on.

269
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:18,242
Carol,
Carol?

270
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:25,120
I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?

271
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,461
Sure.

272
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,677
Uh, does it hurt?

273
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:33,207
It did at first, but not anymore.

274
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:35,911
Chandler?

275
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:40,177
So, uh, how often can you do it?

276
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:42,569
As much as he needs.

277
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,921
Ok, I got one, I got one.

278
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:52,346
If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?

279
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,447
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?

280
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:41,664
Yeah, I forget which ones.

281
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:44,779
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it.
Anybody else want one?

282
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,505
No thanks.

283
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:48,977
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it.

284
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:52,410
There you go.
Thank you.

285
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,156
What a bitch.

286
00:02:58,156 --> 00:02:59,544
Oh, listen you guys.

287
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:03,064
I have this friend at Bloomingdales who's quitting tomorrowand he wants to abuse his discount.

288
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:06,393
So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?

289
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:12,072
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.

290
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:17,379
Ok, um, I'll go with you. 
Great.

291
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,140
Hi, honey.

292
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,738
Hey, sweetums.

293
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:22,208
Hello to the rest.

294
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,224
Hi!

295
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:26,470
Monica what're you doin'?

296
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,116
You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?

297
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:31,302
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?

298
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:37,109
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdales with Julie? 
That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.

299
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,204
But I'm--

300
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:40,610
Monica, she will kill you.

301
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,848
She will kill you like a dog in the street.

302
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:52,021
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?

303
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:54,143
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.

304
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:59,465
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.

305
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:02,317
You're welcome.

306
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:08,868
Woof, woof.

307
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:21,018
Bijan for men?

308
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:23,302
Hey Annabelle.

309
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:25,387
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?

310
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:26,477
Who?

311
00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:39,740
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.

312
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,404
Hombre!

313
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:47,794
What's he doin' in my section?

314
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:50,244
I guess he doesn't know.

315
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:52,689
Well, he's gonna.

316
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:57,800
I'll see you a little later, ok?

317
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,592
Hey, how ya doin'?

318
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,625
Mornin'.

319
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,714
Listen, I know you're new,

320
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:09,108
but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is

321
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,501
my territory.

322
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,676
Your territory, huh?

323
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:15,826
Yeah. Bijan for men?

324
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:16,952
No thanks.

325
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:18,633
Hombre?

326
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:26,978
Yeah. All right.

327
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:31,059
You were saying?

328
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:33,677
Phoebe, listen.

329
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:36,017
You were with me, and we were shopping all day.

330
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:36,765
What?

331
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:38,562
We were shopping, and we had lunch.

332
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,313
Oh, all right. What did I have?

333
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:41,686
You had a salad.

334
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:44,646
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.

335
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:46,187
Hey, guys, what's up.

336
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:49,957
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.

337
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:53,381
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?

338
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:58,863
Um, we went shopping for um,

339
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:02,997
for, fur.

340
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:04,954
You went shopping for fur?

341
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:08,479
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that,

342
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,298
and uh, so then we bought some,

343
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:19,818
uh, boobs.

344
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:24,483
You bought boobs?

345
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:33,779
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.

346
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:40,432
Bijan for men?

347
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,849
Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen,

348
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,486
I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.

349
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:53,090
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.

350
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,418
Ready, Annabelle?

351
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:58,409
You bet.

352
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:10,285
Maybe some other time?

353
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:15,012
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.

354
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:19,543
Bijan for men?

355
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:21,587
Ok, and this is Funny Clown.

356
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:25,596
Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.

357
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,632
Carol, we've been through this before, ok?

358
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:33,793
We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.

359
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:37,072
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.

360
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,658
Don't look so surprised.

361
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,067
I'm a lovely person.

362
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,471
Oh, this is so cute.

363
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:46,427
Oh, I got that for him.

364
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:51,747
My mommies love me.

365
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:54,410
That's clever.

366
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,754
Hello?

367
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:58,084
Oh, Hi, Ju--

368
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:01,500
Hi, Jew!

369
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,942
Uh huh?

370
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:09,474
Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.

371
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:14,866
Did you just say Hi, Jew?

372
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:24,104
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz.

373
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:28,786
Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.

374
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,030
Ben, dinner!

375
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,704
Thanks Aunt Pheebs.

376
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:39,797
Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you,because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.

377
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:44,805
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk.

378
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:45,516
Ok.

379
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:48,723
What did you just do?

380
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:50,561
I licked my arm, what?

381
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:53,379
It's breast milk.

382
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,346
So?

383
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:58,925
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.

384
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:02,599
What is the big deal?

385
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:06,915
What did you just do?

386
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:11,619
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?

387
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,425
You won't even taste it?

388
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:15,079
No!

389
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,045
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?

390
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:22,684
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.

391
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,458
Hey, where is everybody?

392
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,270
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?

393
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,876
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me.

394
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:39,435
Thanks for your jacket.

395
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:41,139
Oh, no problem.

396
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,520
You can borrow it, by the way.

397
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,301
Here are your keys, hon.

398
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:56,098
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?

399
00:09:56,098 --> 00:10:03,109
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.

400
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:06,526
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket

401
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:09,628
That is an excellent excellent question.

402
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:12,578
That is excellent.

403
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,467
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?

404
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:16,286
Judy.

405
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:16,906
Who?

406
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:17,551
Julie.

407
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:18,047
What?

408
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:21,105
Jody.

409
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:23,557
You were with Julie?

410
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:24,909
Look,

411
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:27,220
when it started I was just trying to be nice to her

412
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,418
because she was my brother's girlfriend.

413
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:33,938
And then, one thing led to another and,

414
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:37,789
before I knew it, we were...shopping.

415
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:42,973
Oh.

416
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:45,922
Oh my god.

417
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:49,871
Honey, wait. We only did it once.

418
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,924
It didn't mean anything to me.

419
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:54,033
Yeah, right.

420
00:10:54,033 --> 00:11:00,481
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.

421
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:04,578
Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.

422
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:08,705
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.

423
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:10,337
That is not true!

424
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,284
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?

425
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:18,712
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?

426
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:24,537
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing.

427
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:30,480
Did you go with her to Bloomingdales?

428
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,164
Oh!

429
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:39,959
Ok, ok,

430
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:45,582
ok,I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.

431
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:58,780
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne.Is Rachel working? It's Monica.

432
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,678
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

433
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:05,499
Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok?

434
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:14,282
No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.

435
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:16,172
How did we do?

436
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:18,611
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.

437
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,521
I did not freak out.

438
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:21,478
Why'd you freak out?

439
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:23,738
Because it's breast milk.

440
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:26,338
It's gross.

441
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:29,627
My breast milk is gross?

442
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:33,349
This should be fun.

443
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:34,951
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it.

444
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:38,927
I just don't think breast milk is for adults.

445
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:44,401
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.

446
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:49,778
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.

447
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:54,826
That would be no.

448
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:56,399
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.

449
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,340
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--

450
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,058
like what?

451
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:01,331
Cantaloupe juice.

452
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:08,802
Exactly.

453
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:13,687
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.

454
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,479
Uh huh.

455
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:19,392
Oh, you've tasted it.

456
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:29,176
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.

457
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:36,663
Gimme the bottle.

458
00:13:36,663 --> 00:13:41,485
Gimme the towel.

459
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:05,339
Howdy.

460
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,518
Gimme a box a juice.

461
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:12,247
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

462
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:16,471
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.

463
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:20,302
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.

464
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:25,383
You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.

465
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:27,641
What do you care?

466
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:30,690
You're an actor. This is your day job.
This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.

467
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,341
I know, but, I was the best, you know?

468
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:40,777
I liked being the best.

469
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:42,435
I don't know.
Maybe I should just get outta the game.

470
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:46,431
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.

471
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:47,978
All right, say you do that.

472
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:53,665
You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar.

473
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:55,537
And then where're you gonna run?

474
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:56,537
Yeah I guess you're right.

475
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:57,317
You're damn right I'm right.

476
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:58,860
I say you show this guy what you're made of.

477
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,057
I say you stand your ground.

478
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:05,286
I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.

479
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:06,192
I'm gonna do it.

480
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:07,385
All right.

481
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:13,985
Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

482
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:15,398
I don't know what else to say.

483
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:18,728
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.

484
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:20,531
I feel terrible, I really do.

485
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:23,684
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?

486
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:25,707
Rachel,

487
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:29,930
say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?

488
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,713
Yes.

489
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:31,559
It's that terrible?

490
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,284
Yes. Monica, you don't get it.

491
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,961
It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person

492
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,009
that I am supposed to be with,

493
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:47,237
but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you.

494
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,720
Me? What are you talking about?

495
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,193
Nobody could steal me from you.

496
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:57,778
I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.

497
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:59,633
I mean,

498
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:01,761
you're my...

499
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:06,161
We're, we're...

500
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:07,554
Oh, I love you.

501
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:12,819
I love you too.

502
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:17,268
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me,

503
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:25,789
but um I love you guys too.

504
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:29,446
Oh, I really needed that.

505
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,863
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts,

506
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:37,489
but she didn't do anything wrong.

507
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:41,937
I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.

508
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:47,170
I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.

509
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:52,993
Would you just give that a chance, for me?

510
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:55,640
I'd do anything for you, you know that.

511
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,781
I'd do anything for you.

512
00:16:58,781 --> 00:17:02,528
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

513
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:21,588
Mornin'.

514
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:25,686
I said, mornin'.

515
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:28,349
I heard ya.

516
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,146
All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors.

517
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:38,139
You boys ready?

518
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:39,566
Ready.

519
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:43,990
Yeah, I'm ready.

520
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:30,505
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!

521
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:34,514
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?

522
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:39,563
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

523
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:42,047
My god, what happened?

524
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,582
These new kids, they never last.

525
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,767
Sooner or later, they all...

526
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:50,440
stop lastin'.

527
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,127
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?

528
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:57,404
Sure.

529
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:08,633
So.

530
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:13,658
So.

531
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:16,018
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.

532
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:18,841
I mean, you know, we've never really talked.

533
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:22,542
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?

534
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,857
I know,

535
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:26,109
I probably shouldn't even tell you this,

536
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:31,676
but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.

537
00:19:31,676 --> 00:19:34,303
Really? Me?

538
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:36,178
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding?

539
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:39,658
Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me,

540
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:43,400
and,I it's probably me being totally paranoid,

541
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:54,179
but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.

542
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,859
Well, you're not totally paranoid.

543
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,034
Oy.

544
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:10,467
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um,

545
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:13,761
when you and uh Ross first started going out,

546
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:15,858
it was really hard for me,

547
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:19,628
um, for many reasons,

548
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,178
which I'm not gonna bore you with now,

549
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:26,749
but um,

550
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:29,079
I just, I see how happy he is, you know,

551
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:32,318
and how good you guys are together,

552
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,243
and um,

553
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:36,338
Monica's always saying how nice you are,

554
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:40,552
and god I hate it when she's right.

555
00:20:40,552 --> 00:20:42,425
Thanks.

556
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:46,262
Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?

557
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:49,180
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.

558
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:55,000
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.

559
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:04,528
All right,Julie.

560
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:11,393
What a manipulative bitch.
