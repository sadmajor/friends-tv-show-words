1
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:11,709
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean,

2
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:15,550
we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,673
What?

4
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:20,707
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?

5
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:22,310
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,147
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?

7
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:29,510
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,826
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside

9
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,760
and I'm just not sure we are.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,924
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.

11
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:45,233
Joey they're not real.

12
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,889
I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake.

13
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:52,789
See? honk honk.

14
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,311
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.

15
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:46,574
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.

16
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:50,387
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

17
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:52,609
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.

18
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:53,620
Why not her?

19
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,835
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.

20
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:05,996
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.

21
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:07,477
Joey that is horriable.

22
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:12,155
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know

23
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:15,670
I guess I just got scared.

24
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,089
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

25
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:21,827
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.

26
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:23,915
Hi honey, how did it go?

27
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:25,746
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.

28
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:29,510
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.

29
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,355
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion.

30
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:35,842
My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would.

31
00:02:35,842 --> 00:02:40,606
It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.

32
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:43,052
So what happened?
My parents happened.

33
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:47,537
All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce.

34
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,268
But nooo,

35
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:52,149
they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address.

36
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:57,879
Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them.

37
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,567
But you know what, you know what the good news is?

38
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:02,809
I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.

39
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:08,150
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents. 
Well, how bout just her mom?

40
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,169
Why her mom? 
Cause I already invited her.

41
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:13,790
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?

42
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,775
Oh no, can't invite her.

43
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:20,911
She also steals.

44
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:28,710
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?

45
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:34,554
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.

46
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:35,630
Excuse me?

47
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,994
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.

48
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:43,554
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.

49
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:54,391
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad.

50
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:55,837
What're you doing here?

51
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:58,994
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?

52
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:02,268
No no, the father can,

53
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:06,554
but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.

54
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:10,471
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.

55
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:15,798
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows.

56
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:18,229
Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey

57
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:22,230
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal?

58
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,886
Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?

59
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:29,389
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?

60
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,153
Hi Monica.

61
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:39,651
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.

62
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:43,562
So, basically just a Chinese guy.

63
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:48,749
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

64
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:53,922
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.

65
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:58,809
Well, my goodness, what was that?

66
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:02,591
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.

67
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,278
You thought I was Rachel? 
Yes because uh, you look so young.

68
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:11,863
And because you're both, you know, white women.

69
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:15,564
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?

70
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:18,275
NO! No,

71
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:26,190
I'll take that for ya. 
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you.

72
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,432
Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons...

73
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:35,347
The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...

74
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:40,045
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha.

75
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:43,990
I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so...

76
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,325
Hey, come with me. 
What?

77
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:52,114
Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.

78
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:58,231
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

79
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:03,840
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?

80
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,893
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.

81
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:14,404
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.

82
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:17,269
Uhh, yes, absdolutely,

83
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:19,435
um. Why again?

84
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:23,272
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.

85
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,835
Right this is staging.

86
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:27,502
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.

87
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:32,028
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.

88
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:40,153
Alright you guys are off to party number one

89
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:45,067
and you, you are off to party number two

90
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:49,272
Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.

91
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:53,542
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party?

92
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,434
Alright that's Ross.

93
00:06:57,434 --> 00:07:01,026
Ok, they're coming, shhh.

94
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:10,386
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner. 
Thanks for being born.

95
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:15,554
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.

96
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:19,141
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.

97
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:21,829
Now I love you even more.

98
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:30,234
Surprise. 
Oh my gosh, wow.

99
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:35,292
Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great

100
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:38,128
Happy birthday sweetie.

101
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:41,197
Wow you, you. I had no idea.

102
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:42,070
Really?

103
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,672
No, I knew. 
All right.

104
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,394
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table.

105
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:48,711
Go across the hall. 
What?

106
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,278
Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.

107
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,509
Why? 
Just go.

108
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,535
Surprise.

109
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:01,952
Happy birthday sweetpea.

110
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:04,390
Daddy!

111
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:11,805
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?

112
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:14,789
Well, we could count again.

113
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,170
I can't believe this is happening.

114
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,680
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together

115
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,691
and if they can't deal with it, who cares.

116
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:27,405
I do. 
That's who.

117
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:28,725
Look, are you gonna be ok?

118
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,122
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice,

119
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:35,703
I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.

120
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:41,869
Well, actually just one birthday flan.

121
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:42,506
What?

122
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:45,354
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...

123
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:49,272
Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.

124
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:58,427
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,'

125
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:00,707
and stuck her tounge down my throat.

126
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,430
I love this party.

127
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,391
Quick volleyball question. 
Volleyball?

128
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:10,909
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?

129
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:15,347
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.

130
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,679
Dennis! 
Ok, that's me.

131
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:23,596
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.

132
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,611
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?

133
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:33,232
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.

134
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,637
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go,

135
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:40,128
and write down your most embarassing memory.

136
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:44,403
Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them

137
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:47,200
because they will dry out.

138
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:51,352
Hi Dr. Greene.

139
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:58,000
So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,830
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.

141
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,928
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:07,354
See that's the good thing about my job.

143
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:13,068
All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead

144
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:16,266
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but,

145
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:22,547
um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps

146
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:26,080
until you hear them click.

147
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,065
Gunther, where're you going?

148
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:31,072
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...

149
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:33,585
No. No you can't go.

150
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:38,812
No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.

151
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,848
Listen if you wanna go, just go.

152
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:47,243
No, she'll yell at me again.

153
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:51,105
Alright, I can get you out. 
What?

154
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:59,711
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.

155
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,390
I think I need a drink.

156
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,524
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?

157
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:04,748
Scotch.

158
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:09,144
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.

159
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:12,198
Neat! 
Cool.

160
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:16,113
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.

161
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:18,170
I know.

162
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:23,366
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?

163
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:28,677
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom.

164
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:32,719
Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

165
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:41,118
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.

166
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,284
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat,

167
00:11:44,284 --> 00:11:48,105
scotch neat.

168
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:51,812
Would you excuse me?

169
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:59,883
Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?

170
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:02,248
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket. 
No. no.

171
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,599
Whad'ya mean no?

172
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,330
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area.

173
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,720
If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.

174
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,314
Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.

175
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:20,950
Get my glasses too. 
All righty roo.

176
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,831
What a great moment to say that for the first time.

177
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,157
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is,

178
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:39,467
'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.

179
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,517
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?

180
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:45,241
What?

181
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:52,607
I don't see anything.

182
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,190
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

183
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,363
Ross, whose glasses are those?

184
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,029
Mine.

185
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,534
You wear bi-focals? 
Um-hmm.

186
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:17,033
I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.

187
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:20,194
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?

188
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:23,511
No! 
Well those are very popular frames.

189
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,977
Neil Sedaka wears them.

190
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:32,349
I hear you can get people out of here.

191
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,601
Rachel,

192
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,823
you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.

193
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:40,884
Yeah, like a chimney.

194
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:43,595
Ohh, big smoker.

195
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:45,659
Big big smoker.

196
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:51,674
In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.

197
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:05,468
Are you wearing my glasses?

198
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:09,075
Yes.

199
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:13,514
I was just warming up the earpieces for you.

200
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:16,277
Thank you.

201
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:19,635
Is that one of my cigarettes?

202
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:25,198
Yeah,

203
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,072
yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.

204
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:36,752
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.

205
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:37,891
What about my friend Victor?

206
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:42,073
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.

207
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:46,465
Alright, let me just get my coat.
There isn't time.

208
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:51,049
You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.

209
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:53,864
Is it true they have beer?

210
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:56,858
Everything you've heard is true.

211
00:14:57,193 --> 00:15:02,290
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.

212
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:11,316
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party.

213
00:15:11,316 --> 00:15:14,880
And Gunther!

214
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:20,841
What are you doing here?

215
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,926
Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.

216
00:15:27,353 --> 00:15:28,336
Phoebe.

217
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:31,835
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me.

218
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:37,391
They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.

219
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:42,744
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know,

220
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:48,006
if people would just give it a chance...

221
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,644
You want me to see a therapist?

222
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:53,548
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem.

223
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:58,047
You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.

224
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:03,785
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.

225
00:16:03,785 --> 00:16:08,687
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees?

226
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:11,942
I felt like Gulliver around that place.

227
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:17,593
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.

228
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:20,755
You work and you work and you work at a marriage

229
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:23,200
but all he cares about is his stupid boat.

230
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,254
You work and you work and you work on a boat...

231
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:29,203
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...

232
00:16:29,203 --> 00:16:31,164
...and you sand it and you varnish it...

233
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:34,796
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.

234
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:37,786
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...

235
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:40,880
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...

236
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,867
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...

237
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:53,667
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins.

238
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,712
I'll be skins!

239
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,211
Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger?

240
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:10,348
Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers.

241
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:17,597
Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.

242
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:21,206
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like.

243
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:26,113
My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas.

244
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:31,309
She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker.

245
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,329
Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?

246
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:40,747
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial

247
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:44,802
and, and wetting the bed.

248
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:48,270
Ya know, I just, so weird.

249
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,724
I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other

250
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:56,831
and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.

251
00:17:56,831 --> 00:18:02,147
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?

252
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:08,277
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.

253
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:12,160
Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.

254
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,646
My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side

255
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:19,512
and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then

256
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:24,718
when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong.

257
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:29,677
But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up,

258
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:35,239
you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket.

259
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:39,828
It never occured to anybody to bring another one.

260
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:44,851
And now it's just...

261
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:47,990
I, I know.

262
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:10,874
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.

263
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:13,079
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road.

264
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:18,389
Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.

265
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:20,563
Ok will do. So glad you came.

266
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:22,089
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.

267
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:25,999
Ok, let me go check.

268
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,430
Your mom want's to say goodbye. 
Oh ok.

269
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,751
Happy birthday sweetie.
Ok.

270
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,837
Ahh, you drive safe?

271
00:19:35,837 --> 00:19:38,519
Ross, what're you doing.

272
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,353
I'm getting ready for the water skiing.

273
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,515
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
To get my coat.

274
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,472
No no no.

275
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:57,716
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.

276
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:07,846
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

277
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:13,791
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area,

278
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,319
you should, it's all wrong, you should leave,

279
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,759
ya know, get out.

280
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:33,400
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.

281
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,109
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.

282
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,795
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene.

283
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:54,109
Well, ok, you take care.

284
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:57,872
Oh, you kids

285
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:05,478
Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.

286
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:08,046
Thank you.

287
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:15,674
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.

288
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,637
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.

289
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:23,127
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.

290
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:25,124
Ok, that's enough.

291
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:28,672
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.

292
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:31,290
Ok, I've got one.

293
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:37,484
heads up!

294
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:41,283
Wow, those things almost never come true.
