Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.

00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:34,229
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?

Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.

offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of  Smelly Cat.

00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,207
I told you not to do that yet.

33
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:14,632
And, she wants to do a video.

34
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,833
I'm not done yet, OK. God.

35
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:24,469
OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.

36
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:28,284
I'm done now.

37
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:30,912
?!@#$!%!$^

38
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:35,042
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.

39
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:37,762

- Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.

40
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,374
What're you doing?

41
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:50,068
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood.

42
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:57,465
Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.

43
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:05,764
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.

44
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:08,843
Calm down, I'm blow drying.

45
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:13,116
Blow drying what, you have no hair.

46
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:14,349
What's goin' on?

47
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,973
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour.

48
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,910
I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again.

49
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,749
He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh.

50
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:24,559
It's like I'm sixteen all over again .

51
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:27,966
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.

52
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:32,434
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!

00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:48,561

00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:50,468

59
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,922
I've never wanted you more.

60
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:12,681
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him?

61
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:21,832
Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question...

62
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:24,649
you're going crazy.

63
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,001
- Hello.

64
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,431

00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:38,961
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.

67
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:40,605
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.

00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:45,949
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'

69
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:52,634
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.

70
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:56,187
Oh, well great.

71
00:05:56,187 --> 00:06:01,386
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.

72
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:05,585
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?

73
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:09,070
That's right my friend. It's time for...

74
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,165
Baywatch!!

75
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,707
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?

76
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:20,515
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.

77
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:23,278
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.

78
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:26,566
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?

79
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:30,802
Hey, hey, they're runnin'

80
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:37,278
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running.

81
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:41,546
All the time, running.

82
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:42,793
Run.

83
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:47,254
Run Yasmine, run like the wind.

84
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:49,240
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.

85
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:55,185
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but,

86
00:06:55,185 --> 00:07:00,028
ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.

87
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:03,152
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?

88
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:04,709
You really think he'd take me?

89
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:09,634
I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.

90
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:12,166
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.

91
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,505
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.

92
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:19,442
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night.

93
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:24,446
I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.

94
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:29,226
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright.

95
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:34,887
And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.

96
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:38,675
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.

97
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,391
- But...
- No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact

98
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:47,230
that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.

99
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,112
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?

100
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:51,312
OK.

101
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:59,635
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you?

102
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:03,033
- Smelly cat... 
- Smelly, smelly, smelly, smelly...

103
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,865
Oh woah, oh my God.

104
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,682
I mean like, who was that?

105
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:15,277
They're your backup singers... beind you.

106
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:18,882
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me.

107
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:21,755
You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.

108
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:23,717
Alrighty.

109
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:26,066
- From the top.
- OK.

110
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:32,547
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you?

111
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:37,549
- Smelly cat
- smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad smelly cat, it's not your fault.

112
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,278
OK, sorry.

113
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:46,436
I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is.

114
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:52,840
I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.

115
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:58,478
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.

116
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:02,947
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.

117
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:08,313
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK.

118
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:12,310
If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones.

119
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,286
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,561
- Oh, were you takin' a nap?
- I was.

121
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:20,274
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line.

122
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:24,682
Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back?

123
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:27,674
OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.

124
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:28,875
Did she leave a number?

125
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,274
Did you see me write one down?

126
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:36,400
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,689
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.

128
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:40,437
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.

129
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:43,103
- Look, you wanna get off my back?
- You wanna get out of my face?

130
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:45,628
Wait hold on Tony, hold on.

131
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:52,275
Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on.

132
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:56,526
Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.

133
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:58,034
Give me that.

134
00:09:58,395 --> 00:09:59,360
OK.

135
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:04,711
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place?

136
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,391
Hi mom.

00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:42,448
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.

00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:47,394
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?

142
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:50,770
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.

143
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,715
- Nice to meet ya.

00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:59,043
Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for.

00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:02,834
So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?

146
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:09,473
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.

147
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:15,559
Wow.??Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.

148
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,249
Oh, now it's a spare room?

149
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:22,473
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.

Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?

153
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,724
Is this guy great or what?

154
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:45,191
Yeah, yeah he is.

155
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,753
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?

156
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:56,591
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.

157
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,321
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.

158
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:03,275
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:07,556
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's  Smelly Cat the video.

160
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:14,609

161
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,999

162
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:04,388

164
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:27,240
I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head.

165
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,722
Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.

166
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:34,751
Pretty uhm, different huh?

167
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:39,076
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.

168
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,542
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?

169
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:57,914

171
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:03,194
I just uh, came by to pick up my mail.

172
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:07,390
- Where's the mail?
- Oh it's uh, over there on the table.

173
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,878
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?

174
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:13,012
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.

175
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:20,343
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?

176
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:23,708
Oh, ooh.

00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,473
Huh.

178
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:28,796
What?

179
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:34,221
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.

180
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:38,346
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.

181
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:42,366
Well you guys, I'm outta here.

182
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,918
- See ya pals.
- See ya.

183
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:49,646
So how you two gettin' along?

184
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:51,265
Oh, I couldn't be happier.

185
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,509
Great, well, I'm happy for ya.

186
00:14:57,668 --> 00:14:59,948
Alright that's it.

187
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:05,550
He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his,

188
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,395
his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'.

189
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:13,551
And now there's no juice.

190
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:18,791
There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.

191
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,223
There's another carton right over there.

192
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:25,448
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.

193
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:27,832
Alright, so what's it about?

194
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:32,561
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?

195
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:35,754
- Well I like both eggs equally.
- Oh come on.

196
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:37,826
Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally.

197
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,848
You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.

198
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:43,828
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they?

199
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,989
You took your eggs and you left.

200
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:50,963
You really expect me to never find new eggs?

201
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:53,585
I wanna watch "Entertainment Tonight".

202
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,439
Tough noogies, we're watching "Predators of the Serengetti".

203
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,796
Would you guys stop.

204
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:00,685
It's my TV.

205
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,769
Wha-, oh, quit it.

206
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,394
- Bite me.
- Oh my God.

207
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,800
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.

208
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,925
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.

209
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:12,948
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look,

210
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:17,946
I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK.

211
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,828
So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath

212
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:23,712
because you kids are driving me crazy.

213
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:27,692
OK, what're we gonna do about this?

214
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:29,796
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.

215
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:33,148
Not that, this, US. Oh my God,

216
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:38,567
Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.

217
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:42,155
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.

218
00:16:42,155 --> 00:16:46,272
I just can't stand you being here all the time.

219
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:50,849
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.

220
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:53,628
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?

221
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:58,351
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.

222
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,950
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.

223
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:05,589
- You hated me when we were kids?
- Yes. I hated you.

224
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:10,645
I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.

225
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:12,794
Why did you hate me?

226
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:20,012
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.

227
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:23,509
And that wasn't fun for you?

228
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,030
Duh-huh!

229
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,845
I can't believe you hated me.

230
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:31,904
Now I love you.

231
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:36,172
And not just 'cause I have to.

232
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,553
- Really?
- Yeah.

233
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:43,211
You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.

234
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:48,556
I can do that.

235
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,986
Then I won't have to kill you.

236
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:57,051
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?

237
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:58,751
Yeah, thanks.

238
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,564
- You know what?
- What?

239
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:08,402
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.

240
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:10,635
Ohh... OK.

241
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,399
- Hey.
- Hey.

242
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:21,038
Listen. You are not going to believe this but,

243
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,199
that is not me singing on the video.

244
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,408
No.

245
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:27,684
Yes.

246
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:29,436
Well, how did you find out?

247
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:33,566
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign,

248
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:37,912
saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.

249
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:39,572
So what're you gonna do?

250
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:42,758
- Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
- Sure.

251
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,648
I mean this poor woman.

252
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:46,995
What woman?

253
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:52,110
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.

254
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,068
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?

255
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:57,074
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention.

256
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,432
No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but,

257
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:07,505
according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know.

258
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:09,924
I mean, it's like, she's like one of those animals

259
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:14,584
at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know.

260
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,263
Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and.

261
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:20,347
Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat.

262
00:19:22,783 --> 00:19:25,880
Oh, oh that song has so many levels.

263
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,411
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?

264
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:33,600
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.

265
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:41,880
Yeah o-, OK, alright.

266
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,273
Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.

267
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:50,158
Y-, y-, you like that show?

268
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:53,433
You don't like that show?

269
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:56,836
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.

270
00:19:56,836 --> 00:20:01,033
Well that's the brilliance of it.

271
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,208
The pretty people...

272
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,408
and the running.

273
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:10,471
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.

274
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:13,478
Oh o-, OK man.

275
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:12,132
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.

276
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:17,692
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.

277
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:20,882
- Monica.
- They won't take you to the vet.

278
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,230
Chandler.

279
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:27,115
You're obviously not their favorite pet.

280
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:30,107
- Joey.
- It may not be a bed of roses.

281
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:34,067
- Rachel.
- And you're no friend to those with noses.

282
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:36,746
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry.

283
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:39,581
OK, you guys, once more.
