1
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:05,730
Hey.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,245
So how was Joan?

3
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:08,120
I broke up with her.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,391
Oh why?

5
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:13,283
Don't tell me,

6
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:15,903
They were huge.

7
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:19,018
When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.

8
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:21,107
Come on, they were not that huge.

9
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:22,183
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back,

10
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:25,426
I could see her brain.

11
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:30,128
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?

12
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:31,480
Hold it hold it.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,040
I gotta side with Chandler on this one.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,074
When I first moved to the city,

15
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:37,633
I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser,

16
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:42,420
but she had the biggest Adam's apple.

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,237
It made me nuts.

18
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:46,337
You or me?

19
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,408
I got it.

20
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:57,589
Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

21
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:01,604
You guys are messin' with me, right?

22
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,686
Yeah.

23
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:05,915
That was a good one. For a second there,

24
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:09,021
I was like, "whoa."

25
00:01:54,429 --> 00:02:00,928
So, You name one woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason.

26
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:02,141
Maureen Rosilla.

27
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:09,897
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.

28
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,503
Hello, Mr. Heckles.

29
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:14,140
You're doing it again.

30
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,354
We're not doing anything.

31
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:16,405
You're stomping.

32
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:19,950
It's disturbing my birds.

33
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,862
You don't have birds.

34
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:25,740
I could have birds.

35
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,671
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.

36
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:29,099
Thank you.

37
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,591
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

38
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,141
All right, bye-bye.

39
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:37,391
Ok, Janice. Janice.

40
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,017
You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.

41
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,169
We'll give you Janice.

42
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:43,256
I miss Janice though.

43
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:47,348
"Hello, Chandler Bing."

44
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:51,168
"Oh, my, god."

45
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:57,272
"Oh, Chandler, now, now,

46
00:02:57,272 --> 00:03:07,346
that's it. There, faster!"

47
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:12,298
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.

48
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,523
We won. We won!

49
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:32,609
Mr. Heckles.

50
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,144
How did this happen?

51
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:35,161
He musta been sweepin'.

52
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:40,396
They found a broom in his hand.

53
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:41,660
That's terrible.

54
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,279
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday.

55
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:48,298
It coulda been me.

56
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:50,431
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.

57
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:54,676
You never know.

58
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:59,880
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.

59
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,138
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!

60
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:08,212
Ok, Phoebe.

61
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:13,562
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help.

62
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:16,462
That's fine. Go ahead and scoff.

63
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:18,572
You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in,

64
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:21,111
but that doesn't mean they're not true.

65
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:22,530
Such as?

66
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,737
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?

67
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:30,269
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

68
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:33,018
What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?

69
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:36,536
Nah. Not really.

70
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:38,759
You don't believe in evolution?

71
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,058
I don't know, it's just, you know...

72
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:48,819
monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.

73
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,475
Too easy? Too...

74
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:57,898
The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms,

75
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,161
is is too easy?

76
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:03,023
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

77
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:03,742
Uh, excuse me.

78
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:07,183
Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe.

79
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,863
Evolution is scientific fact,

80
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:10,950
like, like, like the air we breathe,

81
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,727
like gravity.

82
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:18,785
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.

83
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,959
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?

84
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,363
Well, it's not so much that you know,

85
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:26,524
like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...

86
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:29,140
I don't know, lately I get the feeling that

87
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,780
I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.

88
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,065
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.

89
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:42,944
There she is. And over there,

90
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,242
that's the other one.

91
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:46,484
This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney.

92
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:48,103
He'd like to talk to you.

93
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:49,266
What can we do for you?

94
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,539
All right, kids. Here's the deal.

95
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,486
According to my client's will,

96
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:57,764
he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the uh

97
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:03,353
noisy girls in the apartment above mine".

98
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:04,782
Well, what about his family?

99
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:08,137
He didn't have any.

100
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:11,838
Ok, so let's talk money.

101
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,354
All right, there was none.

102
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:19,930
Now let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.

103
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,818
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us.

104
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:26,316
I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life,

105
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:28,644
without even knowing it?...

106
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:31,208
Would you look at this dump? He hated us.

107
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,990
This is his final revenge!

108
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,284
Have you ever seen so much crap?

109
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:39,858
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap

110
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,003
Check this out.

111
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,984
Can I have this?

112
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:50,217
How can you not believe in evolution?

113
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:53,102
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!

114
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:55,767
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life.

115
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,058
Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils

116
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:00,956
from all over the world that actually show

117
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:02,994
the evolution of different species, ok?

118
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:10,491
I mean You can literally see them evolving through time.

119
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,877
Really? You can actually see it?

120
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:17,957
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.

121
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:20,180
See, I didn't know that.

122
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,501
Well, there you go.

123
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,834
Huh.

124
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:31,464
So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?

125
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:33,156
Hey, look at this.

126
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:38,425
"My Big Book of Grievances."

127
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,262
Hey, there's me!

128
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:47,131
April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date.

129
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:48,781
Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.

130
00:07:48,781 --> 00:08:01,010
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning.

131
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,426
Well that's excellent.

132
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:05,683
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp.

133
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:09,418
Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.

134
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:11,168
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.

135
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:16,875
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything,

136
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,593
which, by the way, I also think is very cool.

137
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,763
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.

138
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:26,508
Well, what about my stuff?

139
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:29,085
You don't have any stuff.

140
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:32,604
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?

141
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:33,379
No.

142
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,606
Yes you do.

143
00:08:34,606 --> 00:08:36,274
You think of it as your apartment,

144
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:39,188
and I'm just somebody who rents a room.

145
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:40,481
Mmmmm.

146
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,785
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile,

147
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:47,874
I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.

148
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:48,727
Ok, Pheebs.

149
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:54,221
See how I'm making these little toys move?

150
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:57,111
Opposable thumbs.

151
00:08:57,111 --> 00:09:02,474
Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?

152
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:07,596
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.

153
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,105
Please tell me you're joking.

154
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:12,057
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something,

155
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:13,144
and I don't.

156
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:15,643
No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--

157
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:19,755
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you?

158
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,126
No, what's that all about?

159
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,220
You know it I think, I think maybe it's time you put

160
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:31,395
Ross under the microscope.

161
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:35,717
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

162
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:40,289
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.

163
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,525
Wow, he looks so normal.

164
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,953
He's even kind of cute.

165
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:48,379
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.

166
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,898
Funniest? Heckles?

167
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:51,458
That's what it says.

168
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:56,741
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I.

169
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:59,363
He was right. Would you listen to that?

170
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:01,286
I'd call that excessive.

171
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:02,332
Whoa!

172
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:03,350
What?

173
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,250
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet.

174
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,282
And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was,

175
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:13,362
well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.

176
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,378
So, you were both dorks.

177
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:17,088
Big deal.

178
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:20,057
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me,

179
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:24,219
Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...

180
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:28,480
Would you knock it off?

181
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:46,487
Have you been here all night?

182
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:47,722
Look at this.

183
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:50,513
Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with.

184
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:51,870
Look what he wrote on them.

185
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,171
Vivian, too tall.

186
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:56,792
Madge, big gums.

187
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,196
Too loud,

188
00:10:58,196 --> 00:10:59,081
too smart,

189
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,360
makes noise when she eats.

190
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,663
This is, this is me. This is what I do.

191
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:07,524
I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.

192
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:09,911
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.

193
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,431
Our trains are on the same track,

194
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:15,240
ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same.

195
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,446
Bitter Town.

196
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:18,555
Aloneville.

197
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:21,627
Hermit Junction.

198
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:22,652
All right, you know what we gotta do?

199
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:24,005
We gotta get you outta here.

200
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,626
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.

201
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:26,821
What if I never find somebody?

202
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,765
Or even worse, what if I've found her,

203
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:33,298
but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?

204
00:11:33,298 --> 00:11:36,449
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.

205
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:38,538
How do you know that? How?

206
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:42,018
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.

207
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,739
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married,

208
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,458
and I'm gonna end up alone.

209
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,705
Will you promise me something?

210
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:51,138
When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?

211
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:55,956
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'.

212
00:11:55,956 --> 00:12:00,491
I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?

213
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:06,418
Yeah, I understand.

214
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:09,033
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl.

215
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:12,064
Every year, all right?

216
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,122
You know what?

217
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,502
I'm not gonna end up like this.

218
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:26,538
I'll see you man.

219
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:34,377
Supposably. Supposably.

220
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:36,675
Did they go to the zoo?

221
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:39,016
Supposably.

222
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:53,516
Hi, it's me.

223
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:54,650
Oh,

224
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,940
my,

225
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,685
god.

226
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:02,449
Janice? You called Janice?

227
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,916
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?

228
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,179
You remember Janice, right?

229
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,671
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me.

230
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:17,487
Janice is my last chance to have somebody.

231
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:22,250
Helloo!!

232
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,079
Oh,

233
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:23,827
my,

234
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:27,151
god!

235
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:30,479
Geez, look how fat she got.

236
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:34,355
Hey, it's everybody.

237
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,773
Janice, you're--

238
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,380
Yes, I am.

239
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,860
Is it--?

240
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,101
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing.

241
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:51,418
You are looking at a married lady now.

242
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:53,181
Congratulations.

243
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:55,758
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

244
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:57,480
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?

245
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,777
And what? Missed the expression on your face?

246
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:07,292
Oh no, Janice likes to have her fun.

247
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:15,984
Hey, Rache.

248
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:17,514
You know what we haven't played in a while?

249
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:18,277
What?

250
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:21,785
Hide the Lamp.

251
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:24,138
Monica, let it go.

252
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:26,511
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?

253
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:32,431
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.

254
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:37,701
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.

255
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,258
Ok, Phoebe, this is it.

256
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:43,178
In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.

257
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:47,496
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

258
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:53,001
Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.

259
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,324
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok,

260
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:58,468
I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.

261
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:00,787
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.

262
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:04,519
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much,

263
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:10,130
ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat?

264
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,617
And, up until like what, 50 years ago,

265
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:15,040
you all thought the atom was the smallest thing,

266
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,194
until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out.

267
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:22,193
Now, are you telling me

268
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:25,123
that you are so unbelievably arrogant

269
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:29,067
that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility

270
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:37,659
that you could be wrong about this?

271
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:40,699
There might be,

272
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:43,756
a teeny,

273
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,490
tiny,

274
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,850
possibility.

275
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,726
I can't believe you caved.

276
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:54,659
What?

277
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,940
You just abandoned your whole belief system.

278
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,937
I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you.

279
00:16:02,937 --> 00:16:06,687
How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow?

280
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:09,278
How, how are you going to face the other science guys?

281
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:11,232
How, how are you going to face yourself?

282
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:28,138
Oh!

283
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:30,611
That was fun. So who's hungry?

284
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:33,721
I am. Let me just get my coat.

285
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,866
Ok, all right.

286
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:44,951
It was an accident,

287
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:45,958
I swear, all right.

288
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,686
I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.

289
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:53,138
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp,

290
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,806
and then, all of a sudden,

291
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,827
it's just magically broken?

292
00:16:57,827 --> 00:16:59,143
Phoebe, tell her!

293
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,660
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket,

294
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:08,069
but I uh want to believe you.

295
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,984
Hey Chandler.

296
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,937
Monica just broke my seashell lamp.

297
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:13,566
Neat.

298
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:17,898
I'm gonna die alone.

299
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:20,622
Ok, you win.

300
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,357
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.

301
00:17:23,357 --> 00:17:25,381
Janice was my safety net, ok?

302
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:28,873
And now I have to get a snake.

303
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:30,649
Uh huh. Why is that?

304
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,527
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,

305
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:35,316
I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook,

306
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:38,764
like that guy on the subway who eats his own face.

307
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,937
So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake,

308
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,625
you know. Crazy Snake Man.

309
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,715
And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies,

310
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:46,184
kids will walk past my place,

311
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:46,824
they will run.

312
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:48,504
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,

313
00:17:48,504 --> 00:17:53,390
" they'll shout!

314
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,951
You have got to get over this.ok?

315
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,000
You're not gonna end up alone.

316
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,740
Of course I am.

317
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,239
I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me,

318
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:08,369
and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.

319
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:15,761
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.

320
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,993
You are not a freak. You're a guy.

321
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:21,158
She's right. She's right.

322
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:23,358
You are no different than the rest of them.

323
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:24,537
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

324
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,752
Yes he is. You are totally different.

325
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:28,511
In a bad way?

326
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:30,684
No, honey, in a wonderful way.

327
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:32,457
You know what you want now.

328
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,186
Most guys don't even have a clue.

329
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:35,510
You are ready to take risks,

330
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,661
you are ready to be vulnerable,

331
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:38,140
and intimate with someone.

332
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,943
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.

333
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:42,804
Chandler, you called Janice!

334
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:47,470
That's how much you wanted to be with someone!

335
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,583
You made it!

336
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,509
You're there!

337
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:52,058
You are ready to make a commitment!

338
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:56,679
Whoa! Don't know about that.

339
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:02,502
What you got there?

340
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:06,517
Something else that's not yours that you can break?

341
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:07,887
No. Um,

342
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:09,223
I know you like this,

343
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:11,377
and I want you to have it.

344
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:14,579
I think it'll look good in our apartment.

345
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:22,065
Thank you.

346
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:24,661
That's fine.

347
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:30,019
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night.

348
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:31,350
This woman, Alison, from work.

349
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,482
She's great.

350
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:33,035
She's pretty,

351
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:34,166
she's smart.

352
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,578
And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past,

353
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,682
because she has

354
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:42,457
an unusually large head.

355
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:46,144
But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore.

356
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,110
Look at me. I'm growing.

357
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,643
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

358
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:53,396
I'll take that.

359
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:55,273
You want his yearbook?

360
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:58,137
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him.

361
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,875
I think somebody should have it.

362
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,265
Oh, gosh, this is so weird.

363
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:04,017
I mean, his whole life was in this apartment,

364
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:05,679
and now it's gone.

365
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,166
You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments,

366
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,428
for Mr. Heckles.

367
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,913
I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was,

368
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:22,057
but, he was a person.

369
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:23,826
You're all going to hell.

370
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:28,500
It's really not that big!

371
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,923
Takin' that with you, huh?

372
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:37,261
Oh, yeah.

373
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:39,304
You comin'?

374
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:55,976
Yeah, jus' second.

375
00:20:55,976 --> 00:21:01,017
Good-bye Mr. Heckles.

376
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:07,751
We'll try to keep it down.

377
00:21:13,594 --> 00:21:15,155
Oh, my major was totally useless.

378
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:19,754
I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?

379
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,009
Sure.

380
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:25,233
(My god, that's a big head!

381
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,178
It didn't look this big in the office.

382
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:28,436
Maybe it's the lighting.

383
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:32,577
My head must look like a golf ball at work.

384
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:34,922
All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick,

385
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:37,025
list five things you like about her:

386
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:39,118
Nice smile, good dresser...

387
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:42,118
Big head, big head, big head!)
