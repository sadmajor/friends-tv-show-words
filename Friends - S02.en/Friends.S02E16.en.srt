1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,412
Man this is weird.

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:08,406
You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?

3
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:13,399
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,632
- Waaa-aaah.
- What?

5
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:22,594
The spoon. You licked and-and you put.

6
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:24,950
You licked and you put.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,630
Yeah, so.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,129
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.

9
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:34,111
You used my toothbrush?

10
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:38,667
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.

11
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:42,350
Mine is the red one!

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,432
Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.

13
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:51,205
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?

14
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:53,588
Because soap is soap.

15
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:56,233
It's self-cleaning.

16
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:59,434
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing

17
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:03,114
I wash and the first thing you wash.

18
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:12,000
F r i e n d s
Season 216.The One Where Joey Moves Out.

19
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:52,235
- Hey.
- Hey. 
- Hey.

20
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,753
Ooh, look at you fancy lads.

21
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,235
What's the occasion?

22
00:01:56,235 --> 00:02:00,034
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma?

23
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:02,354
- He's havin' a brunch.
- Ahh.

24
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,506
- OK, ready when you are.
- Okey-doke.

25
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:08,109
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.

26
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:11,043
- Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
- Yes,

27
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:14,544
but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.

28
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:17,001
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?

29
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:19,711
Um, I'm getting a lily

30
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:23,393
for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.

31
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,232
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

32
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,915
- So where you gettin' it?
- I think on my shoulder.

33
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:33,148
What? What's on your shoulder?

34
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:36,311
Um, a chip.

35
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:39,594
A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.

36
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,684
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that?

37
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,237
- Hi.
- Hi.

38
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,586
Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?

39
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:51,635
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?

40
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:54,169
What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like,

41
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:58,759
I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time.

42
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,354
Why's everyone staring at me?

43
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:04,424
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.

44
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:06,037
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?

45
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,590
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?

47
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,426
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.

48
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:18,113
No, I think you should tell them.

49
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:22,475
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.

50
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,003
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind.

51
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:27,875
Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say,

52
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,072
'God I hope they get together.'

53
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,609
- Alright, shall we?
- OK, wait, wait, wait, wait.

54
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:42,750
You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle.

55
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,468
No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.

56
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:50,104
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.

57
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:56,505
- We're here.
- Oh hi kids. Hi darling.

58
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:58,768
- Happy birthday dad.
- Oh thank you.

59
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,791
- Hi ma.
- Happy birthday.

60
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,331
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?

61
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:08,393
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.

62
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,481
- Well, you kids take the train in?
- No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

63
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:18,464
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.

64
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:25,271
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry.

65
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,666
Here, let me get that mom.

66
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,364
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.

67
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:34,208
Are we still on that?

68
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,754
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.

69
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,950
She's probably not even very pretty,

70
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,515
just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.

71
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:54,519
- Can you believe this place?
- I know, this is a great apartment.

72
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,636
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you.

73
00:04:57,636 --> 00:05:01,321
So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.

74
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:04,039
Wow, there's my fantasy come true.

75
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,085
No, seriously.

76
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:07,990
Hey.

77
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,626
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.

78
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:11,510
- Thanks. You want it?
- Huh?

79
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,745
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.

80
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:18,792
- Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
- Why not?

81
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:23,064
You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.

82
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:27,275
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning

83
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:31,151
- on TV. Stop talking. OK.

84
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:34,479
- C'mon, tell us.
- Yeah, is she really 20.

85
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,277
I am not telling you guys anything.

86
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:39,872
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.

87
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,052
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

88
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:44,569
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?

89
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,275
Jack, would you let it go?

90
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:49,607
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You...

91
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:52,692
you got your own little speedster.

92
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:55,153
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.

93
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:59,756
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .

94
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,872
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.

95
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:08,201
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.

96
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,956
OK Rach, which,

97
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:19,710
- which lily? This lily or that lily?
- Well I. . .

98
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,077
I like this lily.

99
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:27,427
It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit.

100
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:30,847
Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.

101
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,429
Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two,

102
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:36,070
not so blonde girl, you're with me.

103
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,927
- Here we go.
- Uh-huh.

104
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,717
- You're not going?
- Uh-huh.

105
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:45,913
- What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
- No.

106
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,757
Well, yeah, maybe.

107
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:49,070
I don't believe this.

108
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,672
Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean,

109
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:56,545
c'mon what is this, 1922?

110
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:58,993
What's 1922?

111
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:01,604
Just, you know, long time ago.

112
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:05,351
Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot.

113
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:10,328
And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible.

114
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:15,960
- Do you want to get this tattoo?
- Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .

115
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,687
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

116
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:24,758
- No.
- OK, who is the boss of you?!!

117
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,724
You?

118
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:29,518
No. You are the boss of you.

119
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:32,972
Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip.

120
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:35,233
GO!!

121
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:44,117
- How ya doin'?
- I'm a twinkie.

122
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:48,508
Really? I'm a hero.

123
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,825
Oh, this is so hard.

124
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:54,745
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

125
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:56,828
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

126
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:59,841
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.

127
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:02,632
My parents are dead.

128
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:05,492
God, you are so lucky.

129
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:11,051
- I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
- I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK.

130
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:17,148
- OK, I'll go out first, alright.
- Alright.

131
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,673
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.

132
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:30,170
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.

133
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:38,208
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.

134
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,313
I have no idea.

135
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:43,799
Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?

136
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,526
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.

137
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:51,873
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.

138
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:55,328
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl.

139
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:58,397
In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.

140
00:08:58,397 --> 00:08:59,121
Really.

141
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,065
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.

142
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:05,569
So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?

143
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:07,906
Of course not.

144
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:11,670
With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.

145
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,474
Oh Jack stop.

146
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:22,473
C'mon, it's my birthday.

147
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:29,476
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.

148
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:33,450
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings.

149
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,426
You want it.

150
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:36,648
Why would I want another apartment, huh?

151
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:38,999
I've already got an apartment that I love.

152
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:43,807
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.

153
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:49,313
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.

154
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:51,312
- What?
- I'm sorry.

155
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:54,682
I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm

156
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:59,993
finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.

157
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:05,072
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself.

158
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:09,403
Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.

159
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:14,274
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever.

160
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:16,805
We're not Bert and Ernie.

161
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,346
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.

162
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,911
- Well that's how I feel.
- Well then maybe you should take it.

163
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:27,510
- Well then maybe I will.
- Fine with me.

164
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,317
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends,

165
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,230
the spoons.

166
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:37,523
Who's drink can I freshen?

167
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:40,519
Almost time for cake.

168
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,552
Mon, Mon, are you OK?

169
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:54,806
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?

170
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:58,526
- Yeah.
- Well, I just caught the live show. 
Eww.

171
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,391
- Hey there.
- What?

172
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,391
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.

173
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:18,478
Humm, really?

174
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,311
Richard. Richard.

175
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:25,310
- Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
- Uhh, not that I know of.

176
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:30,206
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?

177
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:33,912
That - that's an idea.

178
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:37,917
- Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
- Oh? 
Oh? 
Ohh.

179
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:46,325
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?

180
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:50,187
Mom, there are so many people in my life.

181
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:53,158
Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't.

182
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:55,558
Is that crystal?

183
00:11:57,596 --> 00:11:59,671
So, who's the mystery man?

184
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:03,587
- Well, uh, he's a doctor.
- A real doctor?

185
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:05,909
No, a doctor of meat.

186
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:08,568
Of course he's a real doctor.

187
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:14,071
And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.

188
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:17,273
Well that's wonderful. . . I

189
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,994
- Mom, it's OK.
- It is Judy.

190
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,084
Jack.

191
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:31,113
Could you come in here for a moment?

192
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:33,029
NOW!

193
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,148
- Found it.
- I'll take that dad.

194
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:43,850
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.

195
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,183
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.

196
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,193
Dad, I'm the twinkie.

197
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,881
- You're the twinkie?
- She's not a twinkie.

198
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:56,044
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .

199
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:58,286
Oh please, a relationship.

200
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:02,267
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.

201
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,846
Really?

202
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:05,358
Yes.

203
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:09,671
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?

204
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:11,832
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me.

205
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,079
Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.

206
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,050
When did I say that?

207
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,228
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.

208
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:25,610
Happy birthday to you! 
Happy birthday to you!

209
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:34,627
Happy birthday dear Jack! 
Happy birthday to you!

210
00:13:36,218 --> 00:13:39,242
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.

211
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:42,551
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this.

212
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:45,128
OK, lemme se yours.

213
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,672
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.

214
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,304
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.

215
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:54,071
Oh OK.

216
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:57,851
Oh no, oh,

217
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:03,355
it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.

218
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,955
- You didn't get it?
- No.

219
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:10,641
- Why didn't you get it?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

220
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,464
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.

221
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:17,547
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and

222
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:20,711
uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?

223
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:26,597
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.

224
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,615
- Hey.
- Hey.

225
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:32,359
- Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
- Yeah me too. 
I know. Yeah.

226
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:38,908
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .

227
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:42,346
No, we're alright.

228
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:45,360
So I got ya something.

229
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,799
Plastic spoons.

230
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,407
- Great.
- Lick away my man.

231
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:56,706
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.

232
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,264
What?

233
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:03,033
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.

234
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:06,184
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?

235
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:08,135
I'm movin' out like we talked about.

236
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:11,945
Well I didn't think that was serious.

237
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,864
Ya know I thought that was just a fight.

238
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:19,220
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember.

239
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,523
About how I never lived alone or anything.

240
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:26,945
I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.

241
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,889
Well, there you go.

242
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,186
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.

243
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,312
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter.

244
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:47,026
I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.

245
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:53,708
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?

246
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,744
I did pay for half of it.

247
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:00,400
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.

248
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,085
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.

249
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,471
Alright, you're on.

250
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:09,443
I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.

251
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:13,668
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.

252
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:23,095
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?

253
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:28,226
So, are you sorry that I told them?

254
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:32,595
- No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
- Oh.

255
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:36,682
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.

256
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:38,480
- Is Ross here?
- No he went out to get pizza.

257
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,235
Oh really, OK.

258
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,921
That's great.

259
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:45,148
Very tasteful.

260
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:46,947
- Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
- Yes.

261
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:49,111
What? You didn't get one.

262
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:51,375
OK, well then what is this?

263
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,381
What're we looking at?

264
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:59,170
That blue freckle?

265
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,907
OK, that's my tattoo.

266
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:03,809
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing.

267
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:08,506
I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.

268
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,554
OK, hi.

269
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,048
For your information this is exactly what I wanted.

270
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:22,557
This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance.

271
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:26,399
It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.

272
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:30,160
Oh, what a load of crap.

273
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,050
That is a dot.

274
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,512
Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?'

275
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:42,675
OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.

276
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:47,604
You got a tattoo?

277
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:50,566
Maybe.

278
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:55,282
But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.

279
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:57,305
Lemme see.

280
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:02,255
Well?

281
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:11,680
Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.

282
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:16,959
- Really?
- Yeah,

283
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:22,074
so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?

284
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,226
I guess.

285
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:27,107
Hey, save us some pizza.

286
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:34,807
Get out of the corner.

287
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:36,756
Pass it, pass it.

288
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:39,828
Stop talkin' to your men.

289
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:44,547
Yes! And the table is mine.

290
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:48,769
Congratulations.

291
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,990
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?

292
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,535
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . .

293
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:11,056
except when we are here.

294
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:17,163
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.

295
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:20,248
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.

296
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:24,670
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and -

297
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,704
is that my bra?

298
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,801
What the hell you doin' with my bra?

299
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,538
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think.

300
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:36,269
We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof.

301
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:40,583
Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.

302
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,744
Yeah, I remember.

303
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:47,649
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.

304
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,429
Thanks.

305
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:03,686
