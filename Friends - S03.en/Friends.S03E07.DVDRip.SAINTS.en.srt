1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,827
So I told Carl, nobody, no matter
how famous their parents are...

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,507
...is allowed to climb
on the dinosaur.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,801
But, of course,
it went right in one ear...

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,844
I love how he cares
so much about stuff.

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:18,279
If I squint, I can pretend
he's Alan Alda.

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,551
Oh, good. Another dinosaur story.

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,156
When are those gonna become extinct?

8
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:34,263
If I was a superhero who could fly
and be invisible...

9
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,731
...that would be the best.

10
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,140
What does Rachel see in this guy?

11
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,737
I love Rachel.

12
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,314
I wish she was my wife.

13
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,495
Who's singing?

14
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:15,873
The One With the Race Car Bed

15
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,847
When you guys were kids
and you played Happy Days...

16
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,520
...who were you?
I was Richie.

17
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,450
I was always Joanie.

18
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:08,320
Question: Was "Egg the Gellers!"
The war cry of your neighborhood?

19
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,624
- It's the Mattress King!
- Don't look, honey. Change the channel!

20
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,495
Wait! I wanna see this!
After I divorce him...

21
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,672
...half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine!

22
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,899
Despair fills the mattress show room.

23
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,976
My kingdom is suddenly
without a queen.

24
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,771
I'm so depressed...

25
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,505
...I'm going to slash...

26
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,740
...my prices!

27
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,748
Check it out!
599 for a California king!

28
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,978
499 for a pillow-top queen set!

29
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,487
I'm going medieval on prices!

30
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,591
What a wank!

31
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,752
I cannot believe he's using
our divorce to sell mattresses!

32
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:49,094
I know. At 499 for a pillow-top queen,
who cares about the divorce?

33
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,827
Those babies will sell themselves!

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,570
And I'm appalled for you, by the way.

35
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,972
I'm close! I'm cheap! I'm the King!

36
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,045
He stuffs that codpiece, right?

37
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,084
Oh, yeah.

38
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,228
Okay, here you go.

39
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,766
You know what?
I asked for no cinnamon on top.

40
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,240
Okay, Daddy. We'll see you
tomorrow night. Okay, bye.

41
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,109
"We"?

42
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:42,784
- Are having dinner with my Dad
tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.

43
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,889
Oh, shoot!
Tomorrow's not good.

44
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,854
I'm supposed to fall off
the Empire State Building...

45
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,461
...and land on a bicycle
with no seat, so...

46
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,294
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.

47
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,834
Please. He refers to me as "Wet-Head."

48
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,135
Honey, he calls everybody
by a nickname.

49
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,641
I know. Just one dinner.
One night. For me. Please?

50
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,609
I just want him to love you like I do.

51
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,084
All right. Well, not exactly like I do.

52
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,546
But if you do come to dinner...

53
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,281
...I'll love you like I do
in that black thing that you like.

54
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,388
I'll go.

55
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,360
- Fine.
- Thank you.

56
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,396
Hi, Gunther.

57
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,595
Yeah. We'll see.

58
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,442
Hey, you guys!

59
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,111
- Guess what.
- What?

60
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,779
- I got a gig!
- Great!

61
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,446
See, that's why I could never
be an actor. I can't say "gig."

62
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,814
I can't say "croissant."
Oh, my God!

63
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,380
- What's the part?
- It's not a part.

64
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,785
I'm teaching Acting for Soap Operas
at the Learning Extension.

65
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,256
Come on! That's great!

66
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,056
It's, like, my chance
to give something back...

67
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,426
...to the acting community.

68
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,934
You're probably not allowed to sleep
with any of your students.

69
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,572
I know.

70
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,645
I don't know, Monica.
It feels funny just being here.

71
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,749
I mean, if you buy a bed
from Janice's ex-husband...

72
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,752
...that's like betraying Chandler.

73
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,084
Not at these prices!

74
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,998
You know, in England this car would be
on the other side of the store.

75
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,714
Phoebe. Come here.

76
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,911
This is my new bed!

77
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,712
You gotta feel this bad boy!

78
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,118
Monica, it still feels so weird,
you know?

79
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,723
Chandler's your friend.

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,421
Oh, my God!

81
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,857
All right, take this bed.
You can make other friends.

82
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,037
Good evening.

83
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,576
I am Mr. Tribbiani.

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,311
And I'll be teaching
Acting for Soap Operas.

85
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,213
Unfortunately, tonight
will be my only class...

86
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,880
...because due to a rare blood disease
I only have two weeks to live.

87
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,559
So do we get our deposit back?

88
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,193
That was supposed to be an example
of acting for soap operas.

89
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,094
Then why are you
only teaching tonight?

90
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,303
I'm not. Look, why don't we get
straight to the lesson, okay?

91
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,064
Now...

92
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:53,844
...on my first day as Dr. Drake Ramoray
on Days of Our Lives...

93
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:01,411
...I learned one of the most important
things in soap opera acting...

94
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,781
...is reacting.

95
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,651
This does not mean acting again.

96
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,360
It means you don't have a line,
but someone else just did.

97
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,758
And it goes something like this:

98
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,338
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

99
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,374
By the way, before I forget:
To work in soap operas...

100
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,013
...some of you are gonna have
to become much more attractive.

101
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,679
All right, moving right along...

102
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,955
- How was teaching last night?
- Great! You get to say stuff like:

103
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,687
"Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you.
I dismiss you."

104
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,195
Oh, nice.

105
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,867
Guess what?
I got an audition for All My Children!

106
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,698
It's this great part.
This boxer named Nick.

107
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,941
And I'm so, so right for it.
He's just like me.

108
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,906
Except that he's a boxer...

109
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,703
...and has an evil twin.

110
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,986
Hear ye, hear ye!
Delivery from the Mattress King!

111
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,685
- You Miss Geller?
- Okay.

112
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,624
Sign here.

113
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,258
Do I have a middle name?

114
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,901
All right. Monica "Felula"...

115
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,597
...Geller.

116
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,773
It's that bedroom there.

117
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,537
Monica bought a bed
from the Mattress King?

118
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,977
So please, please, please
don't say anything to Chandler.

119
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,943
- You want me to lie to him?
- Is that a problem?

120
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,648
Oh, hey, "Nick the boxer."
Let's see what you got!

121
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,817
- All right, put them up. Come on.
- Hey, you're pretty good at this.

122
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,327
I had to learn.
I was staying at the Y...

123
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,763
...and some of the young men
weren't acting Christian enough.

124
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,804
Hey, now!

125
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,741
And I'm bleeding.
Okay, great.

126
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,503
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian!

127
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,210
I'm sorry.
We'll put some ice on it.

128
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,178
- Put your head back.
- All right.

129
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,909
- I can't see.
- I have you.

130
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,883
Oh, God!

131
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,222
Which bedroom do you want it in,
Ms. Geller?

132
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,656
It's the compulsively neat one
by the window.

133
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,625
Gotcha.

134
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,234
Hi, Daddy!

135
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,997
This is where they put us?

136
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,643
What, there was no table
available in the kitchen?

137
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,542
- Hello, baby.
- You remember Ross.

138
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,908
Nice to see you again, Dr. Greene.

139
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,947
So...

140
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,289
- How's the library?
- Museum.

141
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,526
- What happened to the library?
- There never was a library.

142
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,324
I mean, there are libraries.
It's just...

143
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,831
...that I've never worked at one.

144
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,538
You know what's really good here?
The lobster.

145
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,940
- What do you say? Shall I order three?
- Lf you're really hungry.

146
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,376
It was a joke. I made a joke.

147
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,281
Actually, Daddy,
Ross is allergic to lobster.

148
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,355
What kind of person's
allergic to lobster?

149
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,187
I guess the kind of person
that works in a library.

150
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,987
- It's not...
- I know. It's a museum!

151
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,792
You're the only who can make a joke?
At least mine was funny.

152
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,059
Waiter.

153
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,203
We will have two lobsters
and a menu.

154
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,936
So, Dr. Greene, how's the old boat?

155
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,603
They found rust. Do you know
what rust does to a boat?

156
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,079
Gives it a nice antique-y look?

157
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,581
Rust is boat cancer, Ross.

158
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,351
Wow, I'm sorry.

159
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,859
When I was a kid,
I lost a bike to that.

160
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,493
Excuse me for a moment, will you?

161
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,196
I wanna say good night
to the Levines before we go.

162
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,206
Honey, stop. It's not that bad.

163
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,809
Your dad must have added wrong.
He only tipped like 4%.

164
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,852
Yeah. That's Daddy.

165
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,589
"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it
bother you? You're a waitress.

166
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,353
Yes, it bothers me.

167
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:41,727
If he was a regular at the coffee house,
I'd be serving him sneezers.

168
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,463
- So?
- So, Ross...

169
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,629
...I've bugged him about this
a million times. He won't change.

170
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,708
Do you really serve people sneezers?

171
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,971
Well, I don't.

172
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,842
All right, kids. Ready?

173
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,711
Thanks again, Dr. Greene.

174
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,451
Wait, I think I forgot my receipt.

175
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,594
- You don't need that.
- Why not?

176
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:14,095
The carbon. It's messy. I mean,
gets on your fingers and causes...

177
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,597
...night blindness.

178
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,701
What is this?

179
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,033
Who put a 20 down here? Huh?

180
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,767
Oh, yeah, that would be me.

181
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,641
I have a problem.
I tip way too much. Way too much.

182
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,976
- It's a sickness, really.
- Yeah, it is.

183
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,176
- We have to do something about that.
- Excuse me.

184
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,412
You think I'm cheap?

185
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,717
He didn't mean anything by that.
He really didn't.

186
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,918
Nothing I do means anything. Really.

187
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,233
This is nice.
I pay $200 for dinner.

188
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,926
You put down $20 and you come out
looking like Mr. Big Shot.

189
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,630
You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?
Here. I'll tell you what:

190
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,299
You pay the whole bill,
Mr. Big Shot. All right?

191
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,013
Well, "Mr. Big Shot" is better
than "Wet-Head."

192
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,550
Okay, some tricks of the trade.

193
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,621
Now, I've never been able
to cry as an actor.

194
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:16,022
So if I'm in a scene where I have
to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket...

195
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,560
...take a pair of tweezers...

196
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,595
...and just start pulling.

197
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,332
Or let's say I wanna convey...

198
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,406
...that I've just done something evil.

199
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:34,511
That would be your basic I've-got-a-
fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-I-like-it.

200
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,316
Let's say I've just gotten bad news.

201
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,890
Well, all I do there is try
and divide 232 by 13.

202
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,128
And that's how it's done.

203
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,634
Great soap opera acting
tonight, everybody.

204
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,739
Class dismissed.

205
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,134
- Hey, Mr. Trib.
- Hey.

206
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,437
Guess what? I got an audition!

207
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,247
One of my students got an audition.
I'm so proud!

208
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,113
I was wondering if you'd
consider coaching me for it.

209
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,119
- You bet! What's the part?
- Oh, it's great!

210
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,122
It's a role on All My Children.
Nick the boxer.

211
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,430
You had to do it.
You couldn't leave it alone.

212
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:36,301
Four percent, okay? I tip more than
that when there's a bug in my food.

213
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,341
Tonight was about
the two of you getting along.

214
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,306
Would you just see
my chiropractor already?

215
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,746
I'm gonna go to a doctor who went
to medical school in a mini-mall.

216
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,881
Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?

217
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,890
I'm freaking out!

218
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,797
Monica trusted me with something
and she shouldn't have!

219
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,936
I haven't lived here in a while,
so I have to ask you.

220
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,664
Does Monica still turn the lights on
in her bedroom?

221
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,701
I am so dead!

222
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:18,808
Look, here's the bottom line.
This is fixable if we act fast, okay?

223
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,782
I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow,
and you can make nice.

224
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:25,218
Honey, I have tried to make nice.
It doesn't work.

225
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,551
Look, I realize my father is difficult.

226
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,321
But that's why you have got
to be the bigger man here.

227
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,330
Sweetie, I could be the bigger man.
I could be the biggest man.

228
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:39,300
I could be a big, huge, giant man,
it still wouldn't make a difference.

229
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,737
Except I could pick your father up and
say, "Like me! Like me, tiny doctor!"

230
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,969
Can't you just try it one more time?
For me? For me?

231
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,775
One brunch is not gonna
solve anything.

232
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,248
Face it.
We're never gonna get along.

233
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,785
Well, you are just going to have to.

234
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,550
I've already got a mother and father
who cannot stay in the same room.

235
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,058
I don't want to have a separate room
for you too!

236
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,795
I'll get the bagels.

237
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,137
What's this?

238
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,664
Isn't it cool?

239
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,103
- This is not the bed I ordered.
- I know!

240
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,441
You must have won,
like, a contest or something.

241
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,951
Why is this car in my bedroom?

242
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,089
I'm sorry. I wasn't looking...

243
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,454
...and the store won't take it back
because you signed for it.

244
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,221
- When did I sign for it?
- When I was you.

245
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,422
It's all Joey's fault,
because he left his nose open!

246
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,431
Did you make brownies today?

247
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,503
- Knock, knock!
- Quick!

248
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,733
Take off your dress.
He won't notice the bed.

249
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,276
I'm going for sushi.
Does anybody want...?

250
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,247
Somebody missed the off-ramp!

251
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:07,153
- It's Monica's bed. What?
- Okay.

252
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,954
It's a racecar!

253
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,756
This has always been Monica's bed.
You just noticed?

254
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,661
How self-involved are you?

255
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:22,067
If this bed isn't new, then how come
there's plastic on the mattress?

256
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,206
Sometimes I have bad dreams.

257
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,680
Look...

258
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,184
...I just saw my best friend's brain
smeared across the canvas.

259
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,481
It's not gonna be me.

260
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,157
Not me.

261
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,327
That was good.

262
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,498
That was...

263
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,993
- Tweezers?
- No.

264
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,905
- That was really good.
- Thanks.

265
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,332
Any suggestions?

266
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,974
You told him to play the boxer gay?

267
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,147
Well, I might have said:

268
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,154
"Super-gay."

269
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,961
Joey, the last time an actor did
something this bad, a president died.

270
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,127
Lincoln. Booth.

271
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,029
Something happened at the tunnel?

272
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,996
You're this guy's teacher.
How could you do this?

273
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,702
Because, Monica, the guy's so good.
And I really, really want this part.

274
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,904
Well, if you really, really want it,
then it's okay.

275
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,047
- Hi, Daddy.
- Baby.

276
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,619
- Ross.
- Dr. Greene, how are you?

277
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,895
Thanks for dinner last night.

278
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,224
Thank you for teaching me
a valuable lesson.

279
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,664
Nice hair. What did you do, swim here?

280
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,602
That's it. I can't take it anymore.

281
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,106
What? He's interested in you.
He likes your hair.

282
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,904
- He just wants to know how you got here.
- Oh, please.

283
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,644
- It's hopeless. I'm just gonna go.
- What? Ross...

284
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,818
- I'm sorry. It's just...
- Ross?

285
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,550
What's with the neck?

286
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,655
He has this thing. I keep telling
him to go to my chiropractor.

287
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,552
You still going to him?

288
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,919
That man couldn't get
into med school in Ixtapa!

289
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,723
Thank you.
That's what I keep saying.

290
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,732
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens
to be an excellent doctor.

291
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,064
Wait a minute.
His name is Dr. Bobby?

292
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,565
- That's his last name.
- And his first name.

293
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,176
He's Bobby Bobby?

294
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,310
It's Robert Bobby.

295
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,750
And excuse me, he helps me.

296
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,820
- Please. Ask her how.
- What do you need help for?

297
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,287
My alignment.
One leg's shorter than the other.

298
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,460
- Oh, my God.
- Argue with that.

299
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,061
It's true! My right leg is
two inches shorter!

300
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,663
Come on, you're just tilting!

301
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,691
- Her legs are fine.
- I know that.

302
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,735
- So why do you let her go to him?
- "Let her"?

303
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,466
She doesn't listen to me
about renter's insurance either.

304
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,736
Wait a minute,
you don't have renter's insurance?

305
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,744
What if you're robbed?

306
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,944
How will you run after the robber
with one leg shorter than the other?

307
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,019
- Would you like some juice?
- I'd love some juice.

308
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,591
This is going so well!
Did you see us? Did you see?

309
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,270
Yeah, honey.
I was standing right there.

310
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,506
Why don't you tell him
about the mole I haven't checked yet?

311
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,266
Excellent!

312
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,676
There will come a time
in each of your careers...

313
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:55,319
...when you'll have a chance to screw
over another soap opera actor.

314
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,817
I had such an opportunity
in the recent present.

315
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,826
And I'm ashamed to say...

316
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,929
...that I took it.

317
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,064
I advised a fellow actor
to play a role...

318
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,105
...homosexually.

319
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:23,104
We both auditioned for the part...

320
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,550
...and as it turned out...

321
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,841
...they...

322
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,352
They liked the stupid gay thing
and cast him.

323
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,387
And now...

324
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,928
...he's got a two-year
contract opposite...

325
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,133
...Susan Lucci...

326
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,566
...the first lady
of daytime television.

327
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,001
And me?

328
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,869
Me, I'm stuck here teaching
a bunch of people...

329
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,741
...most of whom are too ugly
to even be on TV.

330
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,412
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

331
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,025
Thank you.

332
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,335
- May I help you?
- Yes, hi.

333
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,335
We spoke earlier. I'm the lady
stuck with the racecar bed.

334
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,943
Look, it's like I told you.
There's nothing I can do.

335
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:30,342
You signed for it.
"Monica Felula Geller."

336
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,176
All right, jester man,
we wanna see the King.

337
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,319
Nobody sees the King.

338
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:41,623
- Okay. I'm talking to the King.
- Hey, you can't go back there!

339
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,892
Oh, my God.

340
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,846
Watch it, lady!

341
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,089
Hey, good-looking.

342
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,703
All right, I'll leave.

343
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,065
My bed's so boring.
