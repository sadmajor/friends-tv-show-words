1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,509
So, what happened?
Did a forest tick you off?

2
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,672
No. You know how we're always
saying we need a place for the mail.

3
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,181
Yeah?

4
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:26,885
I started building one. But then
I decided to take it to the next step.

5
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,392
You're building a post office?

6
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,562
No, an entertainment unit
with a built-in mail cubby.

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,599
- It's a one-day job, max.
- Okay.

8
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,902
My word, those are snug!

9
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,904
Yeah. These are
my old work pants.

10
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,305
Sergio Valente.

11
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,485
Power saw kind of got away
from me there.

12
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:07,165
The One With Frank Jr.

13
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,072
Hey, Pheebs.
Any sign of your brother?

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,271
No, but he's always late.

15
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,780
- I thought you only met him once.
- I did.

16
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,888
I think it sounds big sister-y,
"Frank's always late."

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,119
Well, relax. He'll be here.

18
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,227
I know.
I'm just nervous.

19
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,592
It's just, Mom's dead,
don't talk to my sister...

20
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,494
...Grandma's been sleeping
a lot lately.

21
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,163
It's just the last-desperate-
chance-to-have-a-family kind of thing.

22
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,965
You're sweet to wait with me.

23
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:26,134
Actually, Gunther sent me. You're not
allowed to have cups out here.

24
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,649
Does anyone else think
David Copperfield's cute?

25
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,983
No. But he told me he thinks
you're a fox.

26
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,486
All right. Janice likes him.

27
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,629
In fact, she likes him so much,
she put him on her freebie list.

28
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,157
Her what?

29
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:52,532
We have a deal where we each get to pick
five celebrities we could sleep with...

30
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,432
...and the other one can't get mad.

31
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,803
The heart of every
healthy relationship:

32
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,448
Honesty, respect
and sex with celebrities.

33
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,606
So who's on your list?

34
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,307
Kim Basinger...

35
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,783
...Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry...

36
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,851
...Yasmine Bleeth...

37
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,052
...and Jessica Rabbit.

38
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,994
You do realize that she is a cartoon
and way out of your league?

39
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:24,259
I know. I always wondered if I could
get her eyes to pop out of her head.

40
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,270
This is such a great thing.

41
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:31,807
Annie Esposito would never have
dumped me had we had a list like this.

42
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:36,072
And also, of course,
if her sister was famous.

43
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,682
Who would yours be?

44
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,885
First, I need a boyfriend.
Then I can have a list.

45
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,622
It's just a game, Mon.

46
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,125
Rach, how about you?

47
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:52,424
I don't know. I guess Chris
O'Donnell, John F. Kennedy Jr...

48
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,395
...Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting
and Parker Stevenson.

49
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,899
Spider-Man?

50
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,869
Hardy Boy.

51
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,277
- Peter Parker.
- Thank you.

52
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,336
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?

53
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:12,015
That kind of thing
requires some serious thought.

54
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,211
First, I'd divide my prospective
candidates into categories.

55
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,411
What a geek!

56
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,260
Everybody, this is Frank!
My half brother, Frank!

57
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,893
This is everybody.

58
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,893
- This is Ross.
- How are you?

59
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,794
- Chandler.
- Hi.

60
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,435
- Joey.
- Hey.

61
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,065
This is Monica.

62
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,501
And this is Rachel.

63
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,780
I'm gonna get coffee for us.

64
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,709
Hey, how do you guys get
anything done?

65
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,083
We don't, really.

66
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,318
So now,
do you guys have big plans?

67
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:54,391
Yeah. We're gonna connect
and bond and everything.

68
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:59,223
I thought we could go down to Times
Square and pick up some ninja stars.

69
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:03,562
My friend Larry, he wants me
to take a picture of a hooker.

70
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,173
We really don't take advantage
of living in the city.

71
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,816
Sorry. Did I get you?

72
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,290
No, you didn't get me!

73
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,893
It's an electric drill!
You get me, you kill me!

74
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,295
Calm down!
Do you want this unit or not?

75
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,932
I do not want this unit!

76
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,230
You should've told me before.
I'm not a mind reader.

77
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,033
And we're out of beer.
I'm going to Monica's.

78
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,838
Fine!

79
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,949
Where you heading in those pants?
1982?

80
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,682
Monica, listen...

81
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,794
...I saw down at the hardware store,
they got those designer tiles on sale...

82
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,123
...if you wanna redo
your bathroom floor.

83
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,300
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

84
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,334
Nothing. It's just old and dingy,
that's all.

85
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,536
- I highly doubt that.
- Oh, yeah?

86
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,438
If you move your hamper...

87
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:22,341
...you can see the color
the tile used to be.

88
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,950
I can't live like this!
What are we gonna do?

89
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,518
Relax. Here, hold this.

90
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,451
This old stuff comes right up.
I'll show you.

91
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,684
A little more than I wanted to see.

92
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,458
Look at that!
Every inch of this is glued down.

93
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,262
It'd take forever to pry this up.

94
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,564
You should just leave it.

95
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:52,703
I can't leave it! You gouged
a hole in my dingy floor!

96
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,620
There. There you go.

97
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,420
Yeah, that's nice.

98
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,356
We can put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon.

99
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,855
Give me a new floor!

100
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,830
I can't. Chandler will kill me
if I don't finish the unit.

101
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,869
- I'll pay you double what he's paying you.
- He's not paying me anything.

102
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,562
Triple.

103
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,153
What?

104
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,288
I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?

105
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,217
Because I can and my mom couldn't.

106
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,919
And I figured that was
something I got from our dad.

107
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,497
Well, wait, you mean like this?

108
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,862
Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

109
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,399
You're not doing it.

110
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,209
Oh, right. Okay.
Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

111
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,569
We don't have that.

112
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,950
- When's your birthday?
- February 16.

113
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,583
I know a guy who's the 18th.

114
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,390
That's close.

115
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,028
- When's yours?
- October 25.

116
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,771
That's the same month as Halloween.

117
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,170
So, what kind of things
do you like to do at home?

118
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,478
Melt stuff.

119
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,515
- Okay, I've got three of my five.
- Three of your five what?

120
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,786
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.

121
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,355
God, you're giving this
a lot of thought.

122
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,225
Hey, it's hard, okay?
I only have two spots left.

123
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,595
All right. Who you got it
narrowed down to?

124
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:00,067
- Elizabeth Hurley.
- Very attractive.

125
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,831
Forgiving.

126
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,737
Susan Sarandon.

127
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,607
You know what?
She's too political.

128
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:14,411
She probably wouldn't let you do it unless
you donated four cans of food first.

129
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,918
- And Isabella Rossellini.
- Very hot. Very sexy.

130
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,391
But she's too international.

131
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,325
She's never gonna be around.

132
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,897
- So?
- So you gotta play the odds.

133
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,228
Pick somebody who's gonna be
in the country all the time.

134
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:36,399
Yeah. Because that's why you won't
get Isabella Rossellini. Geography.

135
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,718
Okay. So by "melting"
you meant melting.

136
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,054
- So is it, like, art?
- Yeah, you can melt art.

137
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,561
Hey, can I use your phone?

138
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:04,128
- Sure. You want to call your mom?
- No, I want to melt it.

139
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,005
Just the numbers.
It will still work.

140
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,204
Well, not right now.

141
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,245
I'm gonna go to bed. The fumes
are giving me a headache. So...

142
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,324
Good night, bro.

143
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,089
Good night.

144
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,693
Here.

145
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,733
Just in case.

146
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,564
Oh, excellent!

147
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,290
- What kind of karate is that?
- No kind.

148
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,716
He just makes it up.

149
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,892
- How's it going with you guys?
- So far it kind of blows.

150
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,472
I don't know, I just thought
he'd feel more like a brother.

151
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,105
Like you and Ross.
Close and connected and...

152
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,004
Honey, we're close now.
You wouldn't believe the years...

153
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:25,207
...of noogies and wedgies and flying
wedgies and atomic wedgies and...

154
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,080
That's when the waistband
goes over your head.

155
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,387
We drove each other crazy
playing the shadow game.

156
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,527
- How do you play the shadow game?
- How do you play the shadow game?

157
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,890
- I just asked you.
- I just asked you.

158
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,191
I don't have time for this.

159
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,697
That is what the game is.

160
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,099
You just gave up really quickly.

161
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,400
- You seen Joey?
- What's the matter?

162
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,200
Just this!

163
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:01,580
It's my fault, really, because the
couch is where we keep the varnish.

164
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,787
Somebody wanna hand me
one of those tiles?

165
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,956
- What's going on?
- He's retiling my floor.

166
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,029
Spackle boy!

167
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,161
Get up!

168
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,929
- You started this, you will finish it!
- He started mine first!

169
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,040
Build the unit, Cinderellie
Lay the tile, Cinderellie

170
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,982
- He was helping me first.
- No, I need a bathroom. I'm a girl!

171
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,152
You guys figure it out.
I'm taking a break.

172
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,184
- That's good.
- Take a break?

173
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,016
Yeah. I think even God
rested on the seventh day.

174
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,587
Joey, if this takes seven days...

175
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,753
...you'll be able to meet God
and ask him about it yourself.

176
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,933
Big octopus.

177
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,082
Oh, my God! I totally forgot.

178
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,651
Well, can't someone else do it?

179
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,186
But I have company.

180
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,156
Look, that's all right.
I'll come in. Okay.

181
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,197
I'm sorry,
but I have to go into work.

182
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,129
It's one of my regulars.
He's insisting that I do him, so...

183
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,702
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

184
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,573
I'm a masseuse.
I give people massages and stuff.

185
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,644
You work at one of
those massage parlors?

186
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,980
Well, you know, we don't call it that.
But, yeah.

187
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,212
That's wild.

188
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:48,584
- No, I had no idea.
- Alrighty.

189
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:53,259
I'll be back in a little bit.
Unless you want to come with me.

190
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,399
You mean, like, watch?

191
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,566
No. No, you can get one yourself.
It'll be on the house.

192
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,741
What are big sisters for?

193
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,178
Well, I don't think this. You know?

194
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,403
No. No, no.
I wouldn't do you myself.

195
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,512
I mean, that would be weird.

196
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,317
I'll get one of the
other girls to do it.

197
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,045
This is so much fun!

198
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,082
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

199
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,294
Hey, do Monica and Rachel
work there?

200
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,100
It's beautiful!

201
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,793
It's like the first bathroom
floor there ever was.

202
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,073
What are you going in there for?

203
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,107
You want, like, a number?

204
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,049
- Hey.
- Hi. Bye.

205
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,112
Okay. I'm done with my choices.

206
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,755
These are final.

207
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,818
- Well, it's about time.
- Yeah. Very official.

208
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:00,192
Yeah. Well, you know, Chandler
printed it up on his computer.

209
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,833
And who laminated it?

210
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,860
That was me.

211
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,732
All right, let me see.

212
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,138
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurley...

213
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,706
...Michelle Pfeiffer...

214
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,374
...Dorothy Hamill"?

215
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,655
Hey, it's my list!

216
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,917
You do realize she only spins
like that on ice?

217
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,338
- What's going on?
- She broke my arm!

218
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,337
- He touched my fanny.
- She touched mine first!

219
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,009
That's my job!

220
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:50,341
So, what's the deal? I can have sex
with you, but I can't touch you?

221
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,881
- You can't have sex with her!
- Did you think I was a hooker?

222
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,785
No, okay. I know. You're a masseuse.
It's cool. I'm not a cop!

223
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,020
Ask Mr. Wiffler if he
can wait for five minutes.

224
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,662
Fine.

225
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,264
I don't like you.

226
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,930
So that's what you thought I did?
God!

227
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,334
That's not what I do!

228
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,777
Wait, that's not what you do?

229
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,946
No!

230
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,670
Why would you think that?

231
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,180
I don't know. This is the city,
you know? I just...

232
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,713
I mean...

233
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,318
...I don't know.

234
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,757
Whatever. It's the perfect end
to the perfect weekend anyway.

235
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,355
Wait.

236
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,260
No, you're right.
No, it was perfect.

237
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,130
I can't believe
I screwed it up so bad.

238
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,740
- You thought it was perfect?
- Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect...

239
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,603
...but you know, it was pretty cool,
you know?

240
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:56,645
Because we had all those
great talks, you know?

241
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,915
Which ones in particular
were great for you?

242
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,550
Well, you know, about
the tongue thing, you know?

243
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,421
And how I told you about
my likes and my dislikes.

244
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:17,127
How I like to melt stuff, and how
I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

245
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,432
Right. Okay.

246
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:26,942
I feel like I can really talk to you
because you're my sister, you know?

247
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,907
Yeah. I guess I do.

248
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:35,280
And then I go feel your friend up
and make you mad at me.

249
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,816
Well, I wasn't hopping mad,
you know?

250
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,887
You hopped a little bit.

251
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,594
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
You know, I'm really...

252
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,500
Okay.

253
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,799
Well, this is my favorite part
of the weekend. Right now. This.

254
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,805
This?

255
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,410
Oh, come on.
We went to Times Square.

256
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,705
We found ninja stars. I almost
get my arm broken by a hooker...

257
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,746
She's not a hooker.

258
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,478
When I tell my friends about her,
she will be.

259
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,690
Phoebe, what's that?

260
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,028
Frank Jr. Gave me this before he left.
A present.

261
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,671
It used to belong to our dad.
His garage-door opener.

262
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,000
Until Frank melted it.

263
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,945
Cool!

264
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,479
Sound the bell, gather up
all the men you can find.

265
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,680
We got ourselves
an entertainment unit raising.

266
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,686
No, seriously,
can you help us?

267
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,694
Okay, on three!

268
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,598
- One, two...
- Why don't we just go on two?

269
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,433
- Why two?
- Because it's faster.

270
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,906
I could've counted to three four times
without all the two talk.

271
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:11,447
- All right, but in the future...
- Heavy thing! Not getting lighter!

272
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,586
- One, two...
- So we are going with two?

273
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,459
A good job, Joe.

274
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,396
Wow. It's big.

275
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,167
So big it actually makes
our doors look smaller.

276
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,171
- Maybe my ruler's wrong.
- Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

277
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:45,316
It's not that bad. So it blocks a
little of your door, a little of mine.

278
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,643
I got a better idea.

279
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,413
How about it blocks none of my door
and a lot of your door?

280
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,959
Listen, before I forget,
that side is still wet.

281
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,368
Arm hair stuck!
Arm hair stuck!

282
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,405
Let me just see
if I've got this right.

283
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,981
So this is a half-caf, double-tall,
easy hazelnut...

284
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:24,247
...nonfat, no foam, with whip,
extra-hot latte, right?

285
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,855
Okay. Great.

286
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,287
You freak.

287
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,392
Thank you.

288
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,831
A coffee to go, please.

289
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:45,671
- Isabella Rossellini!
- Are you serious? Oh, my God!

290
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,438
Damn! I cannot believe
I took her off my list.

291
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,549
Why? Because otherwise
you'd go for it?

292
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,544
Yeah, maybe.

293
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,552
You lie.

294
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,788
You don't think I'd go up to her?

295
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:06,056
It took you 10 years to finally admit
you liked me.

296
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:12,270
Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad
that list is laminated.

297
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,771
You know what, honey? You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.

298
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,543
- Okay. Hold my cruller.
- Okay.

299
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,414
Are you really gonna
let him do this?

300
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,074
He's about to go hit
on Isabella Rossellini.

301
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,914
I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.

302
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,627
I'm Ross.

303
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,491
You don't know me,
but I'm a big, big fan of yours.

304
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,132
I mean...

305
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,665
...Blue Velvet.

306
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:50,704
I was wondering if I could maybe
buy you a cup of coffee.

307
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,343
Or reimburse you for that one.

308
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,609
Aren't you with that girl over there?

309
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,779
Well, yeah, kind of.

310
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,685
But that's okay.
We have an understanding.

311
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:11,852
We each have this list of five famous
people, and you were one of mine.

312
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,726
So I'm allowed to sleep with you.

313
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,697
No, no, no.
It's flattering.

314
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:24,231
- I don't know...
- Wait. Wait, Isabella.

315
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:28,936
Don't dismiss this so fast. This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

316
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,274
Yeah, for you.

317
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,414
- Is that the list?
- Yes.

318
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,246
- Can I see it?
- No.

319
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,719
- Come on.
- But... Okay.

320
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,915
I'm not on the list!

321
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,321
But that's not the final draft.

322
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,794
It's laminated.

323
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,428
Okay, see, you were on my list.

324
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,069
But then my friend Chandler...

325
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:59,068
...brought up the very good point
that you are international.

326
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,508
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.

327
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,484
You know, it's ironic
because I have a list...

328
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,552
...of five goofy coffeehouse guys.

329
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:15,125
And yesterday, I just bumped you
for that guy over there.

330
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,367
We're just gonna be friends.

331
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,637
You know what?

332
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,709
Bet you I could fit in there.

333
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,405
I got 5 bucks says you can't.

334
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,914
Get out your checkbook, mister.

335
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,214
I think I have the cash.

336
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,521
You are dog, man!

337
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,494
I totally fit!

338
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,826
Yeah. You got me.

339
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,232
I'm out 5 big ones.

340
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,136
There you go.

341
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,402
Thank you.

342
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,914
Well, hello, Mr. Lincoln!

343
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,009
Better luck next time, buddy!

344
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,189
And the drinks are on me!
