1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,558
Here you go, Pheebs.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,295
Who else wants one of my
special home-baked brownies?

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,497
- I will have one.
- I do.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,069
- That's okay.
- I'm not having one.

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,747
No, no. It's just my tooth.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,846
- All right.
- I'll have one.

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,518
So you need a dentist?
I've got a good one.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,020
Thanks. I have a good one too.
I just can't see him.

9
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,422
See, that is the problem
with invisible dentists.

10
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:34,396
It's very unsettling to see all those
metal tools just flying around.

11
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,430
Why can't you go to him?

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:42,506
Because every time I go
to the dentist, somebody dies.

13
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,675
That is so weird.
Every time I go to the dentist...

14
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:49,039
...I look down the hygienist's blouse.

15
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,349
Phoebe, what...?

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,541
What?

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,478
First, it was my Aunt Mary.

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,121
And then there was John,
my mailman.

19
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,018
And then my cowboy friend,
Albino Bob.

20
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,422
And all these people actually died?

21
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,758
Yes. While I was in the chair.

22
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,196
That's why I take such
good care of my teeth.

23
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,462
It's not about oral hygiene.
I floss to save lives.

24
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,406
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

25
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:19,271
These people just happened to die
when you went to the dentist.

26
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,946
It's just a coincidence.

27
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,413
Tell that to them.
Oh, you can't! They're dead!

28
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:31,822
The One With the
Giant Poking Device

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,967
Thanks, Gunther.

30
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,627
Can I get a napkin too?

31
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,431
Like you don't already
have everything.

32
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,475
You're in pain. Would you just
go to the dentist. Just go.

33
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,775
Fine. But if you're my next victim...

34
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,182
...don't come back as a poltergeist
who sucks me into the TV set.

35
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,089
I promise.

36
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,487
Although, don't feel
like you can't visit.

37
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,127
Hey, is Chandler here?

38
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,066
No. No, he's not.

39
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:53,367
You guys, Joey just saw
Janice kissing her ex-husband.

40
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,597
What?

41
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,799
What are you gonna do?
How are you gonna tell Chandler?

42
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,275
I was thinking about that.
I think the best way would be...

43
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,448
...to not.

44
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,577
You can't keep this to yourself.
If you know, you have to tell him.

45
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,016
It'll kill him.
It'll just kill him.

46
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,089
Wait until I go to the dentist.
Maybe I'll kill him.

47
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:22,862
Ugly Naked Guy's using his new
hammock. It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

48
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,796
I'm going to the dentist.
So listen...

49
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:30,271
...just be on the lookout for anything
that you could fall into...

50
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,036
...or that can fall on you...

51
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,508
...or...

52
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,147
Or just look out!

53
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,144
And I also just want to...

54
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,447
I just want to tell you all that...

55
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,992
Okay. I have a problem. I have
to go into work for a few hours.

56
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,996
Some kids messed up
the Homo sapien display.

57
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,168
What did they do?

58
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,429
They painted over the word
"sapien," for one thing.

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,207
Then they rearranged the figures.
Let's just leave it at that.

60
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,713
Do you want me
to watch Ben for you?

61
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,905
That's what I was gonna ask.
Thank you.

62
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,084
Wait, hello!
What about me?

63
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,721
You? You want to watch Ben.

64
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,458
That would be great!
I just asked Monica...

65
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,960
...because I know how empty
her life is.

66
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,094
I got a science question.

67
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:38,733
If the Homo sapiens were,
in fact, "homo" sapiens...

68
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,644
...is that why they're extinct?

69
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:48,014
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

70
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,247
Hey, I'm not judging.

71
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,925
Look, Benny. Spoon!

72
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,221
Spoon!

73
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,632
Come on. All right, you know what?
I think he's bored.

74
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,132
Here. You wanna play
the airplane game?

75
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,202
You wanna show Rachel?
Come here.

76
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,704
You wanna do something fun?
Okay.

77
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,911
Who's so brave?
You're so brave! Yes, you are.

78
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,987
- You're so brave.
- You're okay.

79
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,421
He's fine.
Let's just put him down.

80
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,425
Come here, babe.
Yes, you're such a good boy.

81
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,929
How could you do that to him?
Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

82
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,159
Nothing, because we're not
telling him.

83
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,495
- We're not?
- No.

84
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,003
All right, I like that.

85
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,738
So we're okay.
We're okay, aren't we?

86
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,138
No, we're not okay.
There's a bump.

87
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,472
What bump?

88
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,205
Oh, my God! Well, push it in!
Push it in!

89
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,146
I cannot push it in!

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,013
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.

91
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,519
- That's it.
- Okay.

92
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,884
- I got it!
- Okay.

93
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,719
The second Ross walks in...

94
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,760
...take him to your bedroom,
and do whatever it is you do...

95
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,692
...that makes him go...

96
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,361
Or...

97
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,703
...we could put a hat on his head.

98
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:17,706
A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where
are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

99
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,468
I'll get Rainy Day Bear!

100
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,044
Because he'll know what to do?

101
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,042
Oh, my God.
You're a genius!

102
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,012
It's kind of sewn on.

103
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,652
- Give it. Give it.
- Okay.

104
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,759
It's just like a bloodbath
in here today!

105
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,295
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

106
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,038
Do you think these pearls are nice?

107
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,003
I'd prefer a mountain bike.

108
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,278
Janice's birthday is coming up.
I wanna get her something special.

109
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,239
- Come in here with me.
- Wait!

110
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,152
You wanna get her something special?
Get her flowers.

111
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,085
Get her candy. Get her gum.
Girls love gum.

112
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,286
That's a good idea. "Dear Janice:
Have a Hubba Bubba birthday."

113
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,255
I would like to get her
something serious.

114
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,627
You want something serious.

115
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,100
You know what you should do?
You should get her one of those...

116
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,795
...barium enemas.

117
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,510
Those are dead serious.

118
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,703
And you know she'll never
get one for herself.

119
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,479
Look, I'm gonna go in here.
And you don't buy me anything, ever!

120
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,416
You can't! You can't.
You can't buy her pearls.

121
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,852
You just can't. You can't,
You can't, you can't!

122
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,923
Why not?

123
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,922
Oh, God.

124
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,195
Here's the thing.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,093
This is the thing.
Okay, the thing is...

126
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,361
What is the thing?

127
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,302
I went down to the
Mattress King's showroom...

128
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,443
...and I saw Janice kissing
her ex-husband.

129
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,678
What?

130
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,749
They were in his office.

131
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,688
She wouldn't do that.
She's with me.

132
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,517
I'm telling you, I saw it.

133
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,625
Well, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

134
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,351
I'm not wrong.

135
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,122
I wish I was.

136
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,727
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,800
Bet that barium enema
doesn't sound so bad now.

138
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:36,412
It makes more sense as an ensemble.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.

139
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,243
Oh! You're alive!
You're alive!

140
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,181
I promised you no one
would die, didn't I?

141
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,848
We'll see about that. Can I use your
phone to call everyone I know?

142
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,052
Sure. We have no money.
Go ahead.

143
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:55,625
Hey, you're not dead!
Okay, see you.

144
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,333
Monica.

145
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,006
Oh, my God!
He just said my name!

146
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,005
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

147
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,178
Monica bang!

148
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,181
Okay, I heard that.

149
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,478
Did he just say, "Monica bang"?

150
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:18,053
Oh, my God!
He's gonna rat me out!

151
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,919
Monica bang!

152
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,659
Sweetie, you need to stop
saying that now.

153
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,389
It's no big deal.
It's not even worth mentioning.

154
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,692
You see? We all do it all the time.

155
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,301
See? Watch this.

156
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,105
Monica bang!
Everybody bang!

157
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,431
Ben bang!

158
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,042
Rachel bang!

159
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,604
Bang, Rachel! Bang!

160
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,548
- Isn't it fun?
- Look at that!

161
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,575
We all do it!

162
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,482
- Okay, I'm stopping now.
- Are you okay?

163
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,318
Yeah. You know, if it's not
a headboard, it's just not worth it.

164
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,733
How's my Bing-a-ling?

165
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,077
I don't know.

166
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,643
You tell me.

167
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,238
Anything you want to tell me?

168
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,645
Because if you...
You should...

169
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,945
You would tell me.

170
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,423
Why are your eyes so wide?

171
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,094
You tell me.

172
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,889
Maybe it's because I was just
fooling around with my ex.

173
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,498
Oh, no. That was you!

174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,324
Oh, my God!

175
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,127
- All right!
- How did you know?

176
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,430
Joey told me.
He saw you two kissing.

177
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,631
In the park?

178
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,107
No. In his office.
How many kisses were there?

179
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,076
- Just those two!
- Why? Why? Why?

180
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,943
Why was there kissing?
There should be no kissing!

181
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,382
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm so, so...

182
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,181
I'm so, so sorry. I just...

183
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,955
What happened was I...
I can't breathe.

184
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,896
Can you get me a bag or something?

185
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,159
Here. Here. Here.

186
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,306
- It's the receipt.
- I'll take it.

187
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,439
Look, I've got to know.

188
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,445
Are you finished with me?

189
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,782
Are you finished with him?

190
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,391
Do you still love him?

191
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,757
Do you still love me?

192
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,897
All right, look...

193
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,596
...I'm gonna need an actual
answer here, okay?

194
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,830
So which is it?

195
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,475
Him or me?

196
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,644
I don't know.

197
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,716
Okay, if you're alive,
you answer your phone!

198
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,136
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy
that you had ice cream before dinner...

199
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:22,103
...if you won't tell him about
our little bonking incident.

200
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,675
Number one, I don't think Ben
understands the concept of bribery.

201
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,472
And number two, I...

202
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,415
- What?
- You said, "number two."

203
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,481
I also said, "number one."

204
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,852
I know.

205
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,723
- Hey, everyone.
- Hi!

206
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,897
How's my little boy?

207
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,998
He's perfect.
Aren't you, Ben?

208
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,227
- He's never been better.
- What did you do, take him whaling?

209
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,205
Monica.

210
00:12:55,407 --> 00:13:00,106
Oh, my God! He just said your name!
That's great! Good job, Ben!

211
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,542
Monica bang!

212
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:07,452
That's right. That's what
I'd sound like if I exploded.

213
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,950
The curse is broken!
I called everybody I know...

214
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,285
...and everyone is alive!

215
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,589
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

216
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,769
My God, I killed another one!

217
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:34,002
The curse is getting stronger too,
to bring down something that big.

218
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,274
Maybe he's just taking a nap.

219
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,178
I'm telling you,
he hasn't moved since this morning.

220
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,784
We should call somebody.

221
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,183
And tell them what? The naked guy
we stare at isn't moving?

222
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,654
We've got to find out if he's alive.

223
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,327
How are we gonna do that?
There's no way.

224
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,223
Well, there is one way.

225
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,194
His window's open.
I say...

226
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,766
...we poke him.

227
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,134
You know how we save
all those chopsticks...

228
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,005
...for no reason
when we get Chinese food?

229
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,808
Well, now we got a reason.

230
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,475
What?

231
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,620
We're fashioning a very long
poking device.

232
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,956
All right.

233
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,356
Hey, what's the matter?

234
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,323
I talked to Janice.

235
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,526
Oh, my God.
Is she going back to him?

236
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,466
She doesn't know.

237
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,106
Says she loves us both.

238
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,640
I woke up this morning,
I was in love.

239
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,336
I was happy!

240
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,877
It serves me right for buying
that 12-pack of condoms.

241
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:52,419
And now I can't even return them,
because she choked on the receipt!

242
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,687
What are you gonna do?

243
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,131
I don't know.

244
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,031
You know? What would you do?

245
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,067
- It doesn't matter what I'd do.
- Come on. Come on. Tell me.

246
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,481
All right, you're...

247
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,408
You're probably not gonna
want to hear this...

248
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,750
...but if it was me,
and this is just me...

249
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,654
...I would bow out.
- What?

250
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,522
What are you talking about?

251
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,331
They have a kid together,
you know?

252
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:42,337
They're, like, a family.

253
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,933
And if, I don't know...

254
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,238
...if there's a chance
they can make that work...

255
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,348
...I know I wouldn't wanna be
the guy who stood in the way.

256
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,079
You okay?

257
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,354
You...

258
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,358
You wanna come poke a nude guy?

259
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,265
Well, he's finally asleep.

260
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,231
About that bump on his head...

261
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,100
Are you sure it's a new bump?

262
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,506
No offense, but I've always thought
of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

263
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,305
It's okay if he bumps his head.
Kids bump their heads all the time.

264
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,452
It was your first time babysitting.
You did the best you could.

265
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,013
- I did!
- I know.

266
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,486
You have to watch them
all the time.

267
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,523
I did! I watched! I watched!

268
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,992
I watched Monica bang his head
against that thing!

269
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,398
Monica did it?

270
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:51,606
Did you notice anything weird
about Ben today?

271
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,035
No, why?

272
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,204
I was just playing with him, and we
were doing the "Alphabet Song"...

273
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,476
...which he used to be good at.
Suddenly, he's leaving out E and F.

274
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,055
It's like they just, I don't know,
fell out of his head.

275
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:11,594
- Really?
- And also, he's walking...

276
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,889
...kind of funny.

277
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:19,094
It's like his left leg is moving
a lot faster than his right leg.

278
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,067
Yeah, he's in there, just...

279
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,674
Oh, my God!
I wrecked your baby!

280
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:34,015
I hope it's still funny
when you're in hell.

281
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,644
You jerk!

282
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:40,951
- You know how much I love that kid!
- Monica bang! Monica bang!

283
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,395
I'll get the hat.

284
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,003
I have something to tell you.

285
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,434
And I want you to let me
get through it...

286
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,767
...because...

287
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:01,412
...it's not gonna be easy.
- Okay.

288
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:07,173
I think you should go back with Gary.

289
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,254
I don't want to be the guy
that breaks up a family.

290
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,117
You know, when my parents split up,
it was because of that guy.

291
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,625
Whenever I would see him,
I would always think:

292
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,357
"You're the reason.
You are why they're not together."

293
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,730
And I hated that guy.

294
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:30,464
And it didn't matter how nice he was
or how happy he made my dad.

295
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,680
It's the right thing to do.

296
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,080
You're right.

297
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:52,154
Oh, God.
But before I can say goodbye...

298
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,193
...there's something I really
need you to know.

299
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,131
The way I feel about you...

300
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,603
...it's like I finally understand...

301
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,266
...what Lionel Richie's
been singing about.

302
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,012
You know?
I mean, what we have...

303
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,240
...it's like movie love.

304
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,244
You're my soul mate.

305
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:20,387
I can't believe we're not gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

306
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,284
Then don't leave me.

307
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,797
What?

308
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,967
Forget what I said.
I was babbling. Pick me!

309
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,831
No, you were right! I gotta give
my marriage another chance.

310
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,604
No, you don't!

311
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,004
I say, you have to give your divorce
another chance!

312
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,773
Sweetie, you should not have
to settle for just half my heart.

313
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:47,008
I'll settle for half your heart.
I'll settle for a quarter.

314
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,155
I'll settle for a little, tiny...
A ventricle.

315
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,761
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,432
- Don't go.
- No, I gotta go.

317
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,899
No.

318
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,834
No! No, no.

319
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,066
Honey. Honey.

320
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,268
- People are looking.
- I don't care.

321
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,071
I don't care!

322
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,349
Yeah, okay. I'm...

323
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,917
I'm leaving now.

324
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,681
You can't leave! I have your shoe!

325
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,429
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

326
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,045
Rachel has those in burgundy.

327
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:54,282
Remember, something this big and long
will be very difficult to maneuver.

328
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,387
Fortunately, I have
experience in that area.

329
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,518
What are you, 12 today?

330
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:05,593
Can we please focus here? A naked
man's life hangs in the balance.

331
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,196
I'm telling you, he's dead.

332
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,835
What we're about to have here
is a dead, fat guy on a stick!

333
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,670
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's poke.

334
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:15,840
Steady.

335
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,736
Steady.

336
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,911
Okay, a little higher.

337
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,668
Careful of the angle.

338
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,542
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.

339
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,388
Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

340
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,825
He's alive! He's alive!

341
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,866
And yet we're still poking him.

342
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,902
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!

343
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,901
He does not look happy.

344
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,236
Now he's showing us
his poking device.

345
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,340
Hey, that's never gonna make it
all the way over here, buddy!
