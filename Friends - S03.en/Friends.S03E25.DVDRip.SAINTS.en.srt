1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,938
So your first sexual experience
was with a woman?

2
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,434
I was 15.
It was my best friend, Ruth.

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,042
And we got drunk
on that hard cider.

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,042
And then suddenly,
we were making out.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,081
Tell it again.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,654
Seriously.

7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:28,455
Is that woman capable of talking
about anything else but sex?

8
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:33,094
Yeah, sure. Earlier she was
talking about geography.

9
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:37,969
She was listing the countries
she's done it in.

10
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,906
I think we all
learned something.

11
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,772
Hey, you guys. Look what I found!
Look at this.

12
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,208
That's my mom's writing.
Look.

13
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,111
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,
graduation, 1965."

14
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:55,083
- Do you know what that means?
- That you're actually 50?

15
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,253
That's not me, Phoebe.
That's her pal Phoebe.

16
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,824
According to her high-school
yearbook, they were BFF.

17
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,825
- Best Friends Forever.
- That's great!

18
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:10,264
I know! She probably has all kinds
of stories about my parents.

19
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,233
And she might even know
where my dad is.

20
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,373
I looked her up.
She lives by the beach.

21
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,439
Maybe this weekend
we can go to the beach.

22
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,974
Yeah, we can!

23
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,272
- Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.
- That's too bad.

24
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,608
Big fat bummer.

25
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,585
So, great! Tomorrow we're
gonna drive out to Montauk.

26
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,153
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

27
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,329
The One At the Beach

28
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,667
Joey will be right down.
He's looking for his mask.

29
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,844
- A swim mask?
- No, his gorilla mask.

30
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,279
He wears it in the ocean
to scare off the fish.

31
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,608
Would you look at them?

32
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,922
I'm never gonna find
a boyfriend again.

33
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,455
I'm gonna die an old maid.

34
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,923
You're not gonna die an old maid.

35
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,688
Maybe an old spinster cook.

36
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,502
- Thanks.
- Besides, worse comes to worse...

37
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,864
...I'll be your boyfriend.

38
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,931
Yeah, right.

39
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,113
Why is that so funny?

40
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,374
You made a joke, right?

41
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,984
So I laughed.

42
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,818
A little too hard.

43
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,483
What am I,
not boyfriend material?

44
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,252
No. You're Chandler.

45
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,730
You know. Chandler!

46
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,434
Okay, so we've established
my name and hit me.

47
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,073
But theoretically, say we weren't
friends. Say it's a blind date.

48
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:32,870
I show up at your door, and I'm,
like, "Hey, nice to meet you."

49
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,308
I'd probably be scared of a guy
using a fake voice.

50
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,247
Hey. Good!
You bought food.

51
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,922
No, just my luggage.

52
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,225
I am having the best karma this week.

53
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,560
First, I find this woman
who knew my parents...

54
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,737
...then my client with the fuzzy back
gives me his beach house.

55
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,736
What about that bike
messenger you hit?

56
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,273
I wasn't talking about his karma.

57
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,670
Hey, check out the hat!

58
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,815
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

59
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,989
I was taken aboard that hat.

60
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,950
They did experiments on me.
I can't have children!

61
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,559
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

62
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,197
Ross gave it to me.

63
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,163
- I think she looks good.
- Thank you.

64
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,599
Did he buy it for you...

65
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:32,964
...or win it for you?

66
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,007
Excuse me,
my fashion-impaired friends...

67
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,201
...I'm here to tell you
that hats are back.

68
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:43,109
And this time, they've ganged up
and formed one giant superhat.

69
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,279
Go, go, go!

70
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,720
Now everybody wants to be
under the hat!

71
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,229
What's with all this sand?

72
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,960
Bob said there might be flood damage.

73
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,366
Either that, or he has
a really big cat.

74
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,167
You know what this reminds me of?

75
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,943
Why couldn't I be your boyfriend?

76
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,440
Are you still on that?

77
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,141
- Would you let it go already?
- Thank you, Joey.

78
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,480
But you'd go out with me, right?

79
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,386
No. It's the same as with Chandler.
We're friends.

80
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,493
Let's say that we were
the last two guys on the planet...

81
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,722
...and you had a gun to your head.
Which one would you pick?

82
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,662
Which one of you
has the gun to my head?

83
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,537
Well, yes.
It's kind of an unusual house.

84
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,575
It has three beautiful bedrooms
and no baths.

85
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,870
But, you know,
the ocean is right there.

86
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,705
Knock, knock, knock.

87
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,215
Hang on a second.
Come in, come in.

88
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,410
So think about it and call me back.

89
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,487
- Are you Phoebe Abbott?
- Yes.

90
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,991
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott!
I'm your best friend's daughter!

91
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,762
You're Irwin's daughter?

92
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,297
No. I mean your old best friend.

93
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,469
Here.

94
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,162
- Lily? From high school? Remember?
- Oh, God, Lily.

95
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,036
Yes. Of course I remember Lily.

96
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,236
- Then you must be...
- Phoebe, Phoebe.

97
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,279
She named me after you, I guess.

98
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,347
Wow. Well.
Look, there's Frank!

99
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,650
Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!
That's my dad. That's Frank!

100
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,759
I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

101
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,453
Take it easy.
If you want, there's cookies.

102
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,497
- Or sangria! I could make sangria!
- No, no!

103
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,293
Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

104
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,167
Anyway, I've been
looking for my father.

105
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,807
- Have you heard from him or seen him?
- No, I'm sorry.

106
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,916
I guess I lost track of everybody
after high school.

107
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,788
Well, so tell me everything
about my parents. Everything.

108
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,188
Well, you know,
we were always together.

109
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,886
- The other kids had a nickname for us.
- What was it?

110
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,565
The Three Losers.

111
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,493
Poor Lily.

112
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,170
I heard about what happened. That
must have been just terrible for you...

113
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,866
...losing your mother that way.

114
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,811
Yeah, no, it was great.

115
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,751
You know what a really good
rainy-day game is?

116
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,793
- What?
- I mean, naked game.

117
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,025
- We should totally play strip poker.
- No!

118
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,598
Are you crazy?

119
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,328
Come on. When you go away,
you have to play. It's, like, a law.

120
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,304
Well, it's not a law.

121
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:58,068
As long as it stays attached to that
tax reform bill, it never will be!

122
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,140
- All done.
- Thank you.

123
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,815
Okay. Who's next?

124
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,285
No!

125
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,117
No way!

126
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,486
Come on, please. I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.

127
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,129
Well, if that's the rule
this weekend...

128
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,062
- Get away.
- Take it like a man. Come on!

129
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,996
Big bullies!

130
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,149
- How are we doing?
- Bored and bored.

131
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,161
You know what naked card game's
never boring?

132
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,330
No!

133
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,928
So, what's Phoebe like?

134
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,898
I'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like?

135
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,531
No, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?

136
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,369
I think she knows where my dad is!

137
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,603
- Cool!
- Well, where is he?

138
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,680
She was pretending she hasn't
heard from him in years...

139
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,817
...but I found this picture
on her fridge.

140
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,715
Isn't this what he would
look like now?

141
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,482
- Totally familiar.
- Oh, yeah!

142
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,288
Why would she lie to you?

143
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,862
We're having dinner tomorrow night,
so I figured she'll tell me then.

144
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,329
Maybe she just wanted
to give him time...

145
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,798
...to buy me presents.
I don't know.

146
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,496
- So you're all bored?
- Yes.

147
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,074
I'll close my eyes
and point to someone.

148
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,872
Whoever I point to has to come up with
something fun, and we have to do it.

149
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,345
Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

150
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,812
You know, we could just do this!

151
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,524
We all have to play strip poker?

152
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,896
Why, all of a sudden,
do you wanna play strip poker?

153
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,764
I think because of margaritas
three, four and nine.

154
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,669
Strip Happy Days Game?

155
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:16,143
I couldn't find cards, so it was this
or Strip Bag-of-old-knitting-stuff.

156
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,372
Done.

157
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:25,117
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points."

158
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,854
If you get five points, you get to make
someone take off one item of clothing.

159
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,622
It hasn't happened yet,
but we're all very excited.

160
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,061
Okay, come on.

161
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,093
Daddy needs a new pair
of electromagnetic microscopes...

162
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,467
...for the Prehistoric Forensics
department.

163
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,515
Okay. "Take Pinky Tuscadero
up to Inspiration Point.

164
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,946
Collect three cool points."
Yeah!

165
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,949
Which gives me five.

166
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,214
And let's see, who is gonna
lose their clothes?

167
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:02,383
I think I pick our strip poker
sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

168
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,396
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

169
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,504
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points."

170
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:21,112
Which means I have five,
and that means I get Joey's boxers.

171
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,581
Fine. Gang up on me.

172
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,689
I got you all
right where I want you.

173
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,854
Come on! Take them off!

174
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,687
Actually, it's kind of cold.

175
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,331
How about I keep my boxers on
and give you a peek at the good stuff?

176
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,995
All right,
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

177
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,170
What are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?

178
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,931
I'm just making margaritas.

179
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,101
Think I'll help her out.

180
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,905
- What is going on here?
- What?

181
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,584
- You're painting his toenails.
- Come on!

182
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,616
- Chasing him around the room.
- Please!

183
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,153
He's totally flirting with you too.

184
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,149
He is, isn't he?

185
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,788
I don't know. Maybe it's just
being here at the beach together...

186
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,056
...I don't know,
but it's like something...

187
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,563
- Hi, Bonnie.
- Hi.

188
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,641
My boss let me off early,
so I took the train.

189
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,209
What are you guys doing?

190
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,937
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

191
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,950
Cool! I'll catch up!

192
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,623
So you still don't think...

193
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,227
...I'm boyfriend material?

194
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,064
I saw you checking me out
during the game last night.

195
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,097
You didn't even
take off your pants.

196
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,635
Well, lucky for you.

197
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,033
- What?
- I don't know.

198
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,942
Well, is everybody else having
just the best time?

199
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,343
Joey's asleep.

200
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,524
After he passed out, we put the
sand around him to keep him warm.

201
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,229
Well, I assume the happy couple
isn't up yet?

202
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,666
Did you guys hear them last night?

203
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,703
I don't know what
they were doing, but...

204
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,240
...sea turtles actually
came up to the house.

205
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,646
Good morning.

206
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,440
- How'd everybody sleep?
- Great.

207
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,675
- Like a log.
- Us too.

208
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:42,988
I'm going for a walk.

209
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,562
Good morning.
Nice breasts by the way.

210
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,070
Hey, what happened to you?

211
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,712
Nothing. I just felt like
hanging out and reading.

212
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,510
The water was so great. We jumped
off this pier and my suit came off.

213
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,518
Sorry I missed that.

214
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,888
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

215
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,717
I brought back half the beach
in my hair.

216
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,919
It was so much easier
when I shaved my head.

217
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,166
You know, I gotta tell you...

218
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,169
...I just loved your look
when you were bald.

219
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,738
Really?

220
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,605
I think about shaving it
all off again sometimes.

221
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,773
- Really?
- Yeah.

222
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,078
You definitely should do that.

223
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,379
- You know what? I should do it!
- Yeah!

224
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,385
You know what? Thank you.
You are so cool.

225
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,683
Stop. Go on.

226
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,589
- Now go shave that head.
- All right.

227
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,531
- I know I've asked you this before.
- A hundred times before!

228
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,343
- How am I not right for you?
- I don't know.

229
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,479
I like guys like Richard.

230
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,411
Or Pete,
before he went insane.

231
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,643
I don't know.
Just somebody more mature.

232
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,379
So I'm not mature enough for you?

233
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,683
Monica needs somebody more mature.

234
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,633
What's the matter?

235
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,701
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.

236
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,340
She claims she had to go out of town
suddenly. She's avoiding me.

237
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:46,068
She doesn't want to tell me where my
father is. She knows but won't tell me!

238
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,439
Pheebs, that sucks.

239
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,414
Well, don't
"Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

240
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,045
- Where are you going?
- She's out of town.

241
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,850
There's gotta be something in her
house that tells me where my father is.

242
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,459
Some people call that
"breaking and entering."

243
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,761
- Well, are any of those people here?
- No.

244
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,197
Okay. Look,
I'll do something nice, okay?

245
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,529
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

246
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,504
Hey, everybody!

247
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,545
Look what you did!

248
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,842
- You wanna touch it?
- No, but it's great.

249
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,611
Come on, touch it.

250
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,359
You can feel all the bones
in your skull.

251
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,434
I was having a little chat
with Bonnie, and guess what?

252
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:57,138
She happened to bring up who was
behind the whole head-shaving idea.

253
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,113
And now, who was it?
That's right. It was you!

254
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,252
That was her idea.

255
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,947
I just gave her a nudge.

256
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,684
She said you gave her the razor.

257
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,927
So anyone up for a midnight dip
in the ocean?

258
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,759
- No, I'm good.
- No, thanks.

259
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,494
- Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay, have fun.

260
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,070
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.

261
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,542
You can see the moonlight
bouncing off her head!

262
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,575
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I don't know.

263
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,844
You don't know?
You balded my girlfriend!

264
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,146
All right.

265
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,526
Do you think it's easy for me
to see you with somebody else?

266
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,752
You're the one who ended it!
Remember?

267
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,955
Because I was mad at you!
Not because I stopped loving you!

268
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,996
- You still love me?
- No.

269
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,961
You still love me.

270
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,441
Yeah, so?
You love me.

271
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,239
What does this mean?

272
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,147
I mean, do you want
to get back together?

273
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,844
No! Maybe!

274
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,614
I don't know.

275
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,196
I still can't forgive you
for what you did.

276
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,336
I can't. But sometimes when
I'm with you, I just feel so...

277
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:26,862
What?

278
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,239
I just feel...

279
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,742
- I just...
- What?

280
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,180
I feel...

281
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,418
No! I don't care!

282
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,924
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker
with you for practice!

283
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,256
But I made cards!

284
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,825
Good night.

285
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,269
I'm going upstairs.

286
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,234
- Good night.
- Good night.

287
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,910
Wanna play strip poker
for practice?

288
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,666
My ass!

289
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,207
No! It's me! It's me!

290
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,401
- I didn't wanna make any noise!
- Then don't break in!

291
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,772
- I'm sorry!
- What are you doing here?

292
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,946
I came to fill your ice-cube tray.

293
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,211
What?

294
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,823
Okay, look.

295
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:34,758
I took this picture from your fridge.
I know that this is my father.

296
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,334
This is Frank Buffay, and you were
standing next to him!

297
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,328
Now, look, I deserve
to know where I came from.

298
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,771
All right? So if you can help me
find my father, then you should.

299
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,138
Otherwise, you're just mean.

300
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,709
So just tell me the truth.

301
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,644
All right.

302
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,149
The man in that picture
is Chuck Mangione.

303
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,489
My father is Chuck Mangione?

304
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,094
No, no!
That's just Chuck Mangione.

305
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,663
I sold him a house last year.

306
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,962
And I'm very sorry, but I really
don't know where your father is.

307
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,967
And that's the truth.

308
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,508
But you're right.

309
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,071
I think that a person should know
where they come from.

310
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,282
Which is why I...

311
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,957
I'm your mother.

312
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,932
I wanted to tell you
yesterday, but I just...

313
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,763
...felt all floopy, and...

314
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,169
You guys are totally
getting back together.

315
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,810
That's not true. She doesn't
even know what she wants.

316
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,946
Rachel's still mad
about the whole thing.

317
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,379
Then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.

318
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,484
Take it from a guy who's...

319
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,986
...never had a long-term relationship.

320
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:10,285
I know, but I really want to go
up there and finish that kiss.

321
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,064
The water is great.
You should go in.

322
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,565
No, thanks. I just had an M&M.

323
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,999
Okay.
Well, good night.

324
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,638
Good night.

325
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,634
- Don't be too long.
- Okey-dokey.

326
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,246
There is not one hair
on that head.

327
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:34,010
It'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.

328
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,119
And I'm finally moving on.

329
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,949
Getting over Rachel was so...

330
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,093
I'm finally feeling sane.
And if I go up there...

331
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,263
...and I kiss her...

332
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,024
God, I want to kiss her!

333
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:52,101
And it doesn't work out, do I wanna
put myself through that again?

334
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,669
Let me get this straight.

335
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:58,832
If you go with Bonnie, you're doing the
smart, healthy thing and moving on.

336
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,445
Right? And if you go with Rachel,
Bonnie's free tonight?

337
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,271
Hi there.

338
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,472
That's that weird voice again.

339
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,973
Okay.
Let me try it again.

340
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,579
You're gonna wanna date this next guy,
I swear! Okay, come on.

341
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,955
I can only do it
with the voice now.

342
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,455
Okay, okay.
Close the door!

343
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,631
Hi, I'm Dorf!

344
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,860
Your date for the evening.

345
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,769
Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff!
