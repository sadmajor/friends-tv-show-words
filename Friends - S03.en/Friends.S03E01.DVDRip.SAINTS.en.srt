1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:06,035
- That girl totally winked at me!
- She did not wink at you.

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,673
You always think somebody's
winking at you.

3
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:29,827
The One With the
Princess Leia Fantasy

4
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,769
I have to say "Tupelo Honey"
by Van Morrison.

5
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,371
No way!

6
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,543
The most romantic song ever was
"The Way We Were."

7
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:22,613
I think the one that Elton John wrote
for that guy on Who's the Boss?

8
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,915
What song was that, Pheebs?

9
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,985
Hold me close
Young Tony Danza

10
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,328
- Hi, Monica.
- Hi, Mon.

11
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,429
Hey, Mon.

12
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,366
Oh, my God!

13
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,399
- Has she slept at all?
- No.

14
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,562
- It's been three nights in a row.
- She finally stopped crying yesterday.

15
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,676
But then she found one of Richard's
cigar butts on the terrace...

16
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,473
Okay, that explains it.
I got a call at 2 in the morning...

17
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,742
...and all I could hear was
this squeaky sound. So I thought:

18
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,510
"It's, like, a mouse or a possum."

19
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,515
Then I realized, like:

20
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:09,752
"Okay, where would a mouse or a possum
get the money to make the phone call?"

21
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,226
- Morning.
- Morning.

22
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,768
You made pancakes?

23
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,705
Yeah, like there's any way
I could ever do that.

24
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,343
Monica and Rachel had syrup

25
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,769
Now I can get my man to cheer up

26
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,180
- Good morning, Joey.
- Good morning.

27
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,549
Someone's wearing grumpy pants.

28
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,850
It's gotta be you, man.
I'm wearing smarty-pants.

29
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,892
Okay, here we go: One, two...

30
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:48,295
...and here's my chance
to give you a third one.

31
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,800
- Joey?
- No, no. I'll just have juice.

32
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,838
Why don't you stay home from work today
and just hang out with me?

33
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,101
Oh, I wish.

34
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,042
You have that report to finish,
and I've gotta go see my lawyer.

35
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,910
I can't believe I date
a girl who's getting divorced.

36
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,052
I'm such a grownup.

37
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,550
Joey! Hey!

38
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,655
Go to your room!

39
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,181
Chandler! Hey!

40
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,220
Up yours!

41
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,622
I gotta go, I gotta go.

42
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,057
Not without a kiss.

43
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,391
Maybe I won't kiss you
so you'll stay.

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,761
Kiss her. Kiss her!

45
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,137
I'll see you later, sweetie.
Bye, Joey.

46
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,398
Bye-bye, Janice.

47
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,135
So when are you dumping her?

48
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,179
Nope. Not this time.

49
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,247
Come on, quit yanking me.

50
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,379
I'm not yanking you.

51
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,118
- This is Janice.
- Yeah, I know.

52
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,760
She makes me happy.

53
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,087
Okay. All right.

54
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,859
You look me in the eye and tell me,
without blinking...

55
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,765
...that you're not breaking up
with her. No blinking.

56
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,333
I'm not breaking up with her!

57
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,646
God, look what I found in the drain!

58
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,014
What?

59
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:21,186
It's some of Richard's hair!
What do I do with this?

60
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,589
Getting it away from me
would be job one.

61
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,762
It's weird, but I don't want
to throw this away.

62
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,027
I mean, this is all I have left of him.

63
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,761
Gross...

64
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,531
...drain hair.

65
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:46,214
Cool! It looks like a tiny
little person drowning in your cereal.

66
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,484
God, what is wrong with me?

67
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,717
- You need to get some sleep.
- I need to get some Richard.

68
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,126
You broke up with him for a reason.

69
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:03,132
I know. I know.
I'm just so tired of missing him.

70
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,567
I'm tired of wondering why he
hasn't called. Why hasn't he called?

71
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,798
Maybe because you told him not to?

72
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,110
What are you, the Memory Woman?

73
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,006
They're not breaking up!
Chandler and Janice?

74
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,810
They're not breaking up!
He didn't blink or anything!

75
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,510
I'm not surprised.
Have you seen them together?

76
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,158
- They're really cute.
- "Cute"? This is Janice!

77
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,658
You remember Janice?

78
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,386
Yes, I remember. She's annoying.
But you know what?

79
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,122
She's his girlfriend now.
I mean, what can we do?

80
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,804
There you go! That's the spirit
I'm looking for! "What can we do?"

81
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,573
All right, who's first, huh? Ross?

82
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,642
I think Chandler's our friend,
and Janice makes him happy.

83
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,336
So I say we all be adult about it
and accept her.

84
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,642
We'll call that "Plan B," all right?

85
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,213
Come on, people!
We need some inspiration.

86
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,753
Okay, all right.
You want a plan? Here we go:

87
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:02,860
So, Ross, you go in through the air
duct and disable the alarm, okay?

88
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,360
Then the rest of us
will rappel down ropes.

89
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,899
We're in and out in 10 minutes
and disappear into the night. Huh?

90
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,952
Honey...

91
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,990
...I was wondering...

92
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:39,563
Do you still have
that Navy uniform?

93
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,232
No, I had to return it
to the costume place.

94
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,873
I think I have an old band uniform
from high school.

95
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,975
You remember not having sex
in high school, right?

96
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,410
- Well, honey, what about you?
- What?

97
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,347
Do you have any fun, you know,
fantasy-type things?

98
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,986
No.

99
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,057
Come on. You gotta have one.

100
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,132
Nope.

101
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,928
- Ross. You know what?
- What?

102
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,627
If you tell me, I might do it.

103
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:35,151
Did you ever see Return of the Jedi?

104
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,166
Do you remember the scene...

105
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,900
...with Jabba the Hutt?

106
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:57,137
He was this really fat worm guy.

107
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,272
Wow. Men and women
really are different.

108
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,403
No. No. No.

109
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:06,517
See, Jabba had as his prisoner...

110
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,949
...Princess Leia.

111
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,494
Princess Leia was wearing...

112
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,520
...this gold bikini thing.

113
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,992
It was pretty cool.

114
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,164
So are you saying
that you would like me...

115
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,374
...to dress up like Princess Leia...

116
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,806
...in a gold bikini?

117
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,841
Okay.

118
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,909
Princess Leia and the gold bikini?
Every guy our age loved that.

119
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,686
Really?

120
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,791
It's huge! That's the moment
when she stopped being a princess...

121
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,692
...and she became, like,
you know, a woman.

122
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:59,163
- Did you ever do the Leia thing?
- Oh, yeah.

123
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,542
Really? That great, huh?

124
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,572
No, it's just that I got this new pager
and I have it on vibrate.

125
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,244
See you.

126
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,048
- Hey.
- Hi, you guys!

127
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,420
Look who I found standing
outside the Szechuan Dragon...

128
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,857
...staring at a parking meter.

129
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,934
- Why aren't you at work?
- Oh, they sent me home.

130
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,605
Why?

131
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,468
Because I don't work
at the Szechuan Dragon.

132
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,338
- You really need to get some sleep.
- I know I do.

133
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,050
- Guess what? They published my paper.
- Really?

134
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,583
"Statistical Deviations
in the Carbon Dating...

135
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:52,019
...of Fossilized Algae:
History or Mystery?"

136
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,685
Rach, look!

137
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,270
Where is my strong Ross Skywalker
to come rescue me?

138
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,376
There he is!

139
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:17,983
- Wheel!
- Of!

140
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,981
Fortune!

141
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,315
This guy's so stupid.

142
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,988
It's Count Rushmore!

143
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,354
You know, you should
really go on this show.

144
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,593
Listen, I got three tickets
to the Rangers tonight.

145
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,860
- What do you say?
- I say I am there!

146
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,731
Cool!

147
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,638
- Is Ross going too?
- No. Janice.

148
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,742
Janice?

149
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:49,075
Because I just feel bad for Ross,
you know?

150
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,877
We always go together. We're, like,
the Three Hockey-teers, you know?

151
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,947
I may be way out on a limb here,
but do you have a problem with Janice?

152
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,648
No!

153
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,553
Yes...

154
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,024
Oh, God, how do I say this?

155
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,530
You know that girl from
the Greek restaurant with the hair?

156
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,798
That girl that I hate?
She drives me crazy.

157
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:21,537
Look, I don't hate Janice.
She's just a lot to take, you know?

158
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,519
- Well, there you go.
- Come on, don't look at me like that.

159
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,019
She used to drive you nuts
before too, remember?

160
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,556
I'm crazy about her now.
I think this could be the real thing.

161
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,557
Capital R, capital T!

162
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,629
Don't worry,
those are the right letters.

163
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,396
Look, what do you want me to say?

164
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,763
- I want you to say that you like her!
- I can't.

165
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,272
- Like her!
- No.

166
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,104
So you're not even gonna try?

167
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,509
What's the point? It's like
this chemical thing, you know?

168
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,708
Every time she starts laughing,
I just wanna...

169
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,416
...pull my arm off just so I have
something to throw at her.

170
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,785
Thanks for trying.

171
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:14,498
Oh, and by the way,
there is no Count Rushmore!

172
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,933
Yeah? Then who's the guy that
painted the faces on the mountain?

173
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,008
How could you have told her?

174
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,409
I didn't think it would be
that big a deal!

175
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,050
She didn't think it would be
that big a deal!

176
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,948
Who are you talking to
when you do that?

177
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:40,522
Look, that was supposed to be
a private, personal thing between us.

178
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,958
Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay?
We tell each other everything.

179
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,155
I mean, come on!
Guys do the same thing.

180
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,130
What about all that locker-room stuff?

181
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,271
That's different.
That's like, who dated a stripper?

182
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,771
Or who did it on the back
of the Staten Island ferry?

183
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,007
- Both of those Joey?
- Yeah.

184
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,677
But you don't talk
about your girlfriend...

185
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,818
...and the intimate stuff
you do with her.

186
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,950
- Not even with your best friend?
- No.

187
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,215
That is so sad.

188
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:17,526
You're missing out on so much.
I mean, the bonding and the sharing...

189
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,963
...and knowing that someone else is
going through the same thing you are.

190
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,568
So, what, you tell each
other everything?

191
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,565
Pretty much.

192
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,978
Did you talk
about the night of five times?

193
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,118
Do you tell people
about the night of five times?

194
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,581
Honey, that was with Carol.

195
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,350
I know, but it's still worth
mentioning, I think.

196
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,720
Relax every muscle in your body.

197
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:58,095
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.

198
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,905
Okay, now close your eyes...

199
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,167
...and think of a happy place.

200
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,004
Tell me your happy place.

201
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,641
Richard's living room, drinking wine.

202
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:15,014
No, no, no. Not a Richard thing.
Just put down the glass and get out.

203
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,120
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.

204
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:23,125
Okay, fine. Use my happy place.
Just don't move anything in there.

205
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,723
I'll try not to.

206
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,958
Okay. All right, so,
you're in a meadow...

207
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,865
...millions of stars in the sky...

208
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,097
You think breaking up was a mistake?

209
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,673
There are no questions
in the happy place.

210
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,540
Okay. Just the warm breeze...

211
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:45,239
...and the moonlight flowing
through the trees.

212
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,783
I'll bet he's over me.
I'll bet he's fine.

213
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:53,084
Betting and wagering of any kind
are not permitted in the happy place.

214
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,955
There's just, you know,
the lovely waterfalls...

215
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,687
...and the trickling fountains...

216
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,529
...and the calming sounds
of the babbling brook.

217
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,796
Okay, this isn't working.

218
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,907
I'm still awake,
and now I have to pee.

219
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,905
Guess who!

220
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,652
Janice. Hi. You just missed Chandler...

221
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,828
...but won't you come in
before you go?

222
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,292
So I hear...

223
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,797
...you hate me!

224
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,470
I never said "hate."
I was very careful about that.

225
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:46,941
A little birdie told me you wanted
to rip your arm off and throw it at me.

226
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:52,881
And you got "hate" from that?
You're taking a big leap there.

227
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,643
All right, fine, fine, fine!

228
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,653
We have got to do something
about our little situation here.

229
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,484
So this is my idea.

230
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,527
You and me spending
some quality time together.

231
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,697
- But what does that...?
- For Chandler!

232
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,629
Okay. I'm in.

233
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,569
Okay! This is what we'll call it:
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

234
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,201
Does it have to be a whole day?

235
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:24,644
Yes, because that's how long
it takes to love me.

236
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,753
Yeah, I know.
I sleep in the next room.

237
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,194
So do you guys all hate Janice too?

238
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:41,264
You hate Janice now?
Joey's gonna be so relieved.

239
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,263
Oh, my God.

240
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,239
Oh, my God.

241
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,773
Well, look, everybody. It's Weepy:

242
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,241
"The Mime that Cares Too Much."

243
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,078
Then I went down
to the post office...

244
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,448
...and it turns out it was those videos
that I ordered for Richard...

245
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,885
...about the Civil War.

246
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,388
He loved the Civil War.

247
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,290
Monica, do you want us
to take you home?

248
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,303
Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.

249
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,945
Women tell each other everything!
Did you know that?

250
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,752
No, Chandler, everything.

251
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,653
Like stuff you like. Stuff she likes.

252
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,055
Technique. Stamina. Girth.

253
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,157
Girth?

254
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,761
Why? Why? Why? Why?

255
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,730
Why would they do this?

256
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,202
Rachel says sharing's great
and supposedly...

257
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,001
...you know, we ought to be doing it.

258
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,307
Do you wanna?

259
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,611
We're not gonna talk about girth,
are we?

260
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,812
- Okay.
- Yeah?

261
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,954
All right, you go first.

262
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,885
Okay. Okay, I'll go first.

263
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,322
So the other night...

264
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:19,054
...Rachel and I are in bed
talking about fantasies...

265
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,223
...and I happened
to describe a particular...

266
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,202
...Star Wars thing...

267
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,202
- Princess Leia and the gold bikini.
- Yes!

268
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,874
I know!

269
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,735
Well, that was easy.

270
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,211
- Okay, you go.
- Okay.

271
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,716
You know when you're in bed
with a woman...

272
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,756
...and fooling around...

273
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,927
...and you get all these
mental images in your brain?

274
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,926
Like Elle MacPherson
or the girl at the Xerox place?

275
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,827
- With the bellybutton ring?
- I know.

276
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:59,101
And then all of a sudden,
your mom pops into your head.

277
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:03,135
And you're like,
"Mom, get out of here!"

278
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,175
But after that,
you can't think of anything else.

279
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:11,577
And you can't stop what you're doing.
So it's kind of like you're...

280
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,977
...you know...

281
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,152
...you know...

282
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,316
You don't know!

283
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,515
Your mom?

284
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,452
You're telling me about your mom?
What is the matter with you?

285
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,398
- You said...
- I said "share," not "scare"!

286
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,667
Go sit over there!

287
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,165
We're back!

288
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,475
What are you guys doing together?

289
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,911
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

290
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,748
Really?

291
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,114
We went to a Mets game.
We got Chinese food.

292
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,951
And, you know, I love this woman.

293
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,822
You have got competition, buddy.

294
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,426
I just came by to give you a kiss.

295
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:08,265
I have to go pick up the baby.
So I'll see you later, sweetheart.

296
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,667
You too, Chandler.

297
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:24,080
- You still can't stand her, can you?
- I'm sorry, man. I tried! I really did!

298
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,917
I appreciate you giving it a shot.

299
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,554
But, you know, the good thing...

300
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:34,163
...is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived.

301
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,631
And what's even more amazing,
so did she.

302
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,565
It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.

303
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:45,104
- I guess that's something.
- Oh, man, that's huge!

304
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,574
Now I know I can stand
to be around her.

305
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,612
Which means I get
to hang out with you.

306
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,444
Which is kind of
the whole point anyway.

307
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,751
Oh, hey! We stopped by
the coffee shop and ran into Ross.

308
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,625
Oh, God.

309
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,428
If it makes you feel any better,
I do it too.

310
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,341
- Really?
- Oh, yeah!

311
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,943
I always picture your mom
when I'm having sex.

312
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,313
April 12, 1861.

313
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,790
The United States garrison
at Fort Sumter was fired upon.

314
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,722
It is now under bombardment by...

315
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,668
Dad! What are you doing here?

316
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:55,506
It's your mother's bridge night, so I
came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.

317
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,585
Since when did you start
smoking cigars?

318
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,613
I don't.
I just like the smell of them.

319
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,253
So, what are you really doing here?

320
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,363
I just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

321
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,895
Why wouldn't I be okay?

322
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,499
I saw Richard.

323
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,569
So how you doing?

324
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,139
I'm fine.

325
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,744
I'm just a little tired,
but I'm okay.

326
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,608
- How's Richard doing?
- You don't wanna know.

327
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,580
No, I really, really do.

328
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,049
Well, he's doing terrible!

329
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,790
Really?

330
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,757
Worse than when he broke up
with Barbara.

331
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:48,762
- You're not just saying that, are you?
- No, the man is a mess!

332
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,130
- Was he crying?
- No.

333
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:56,034
Do you think he was waiting till
after you left, so he could cry?

334
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,765
Maybe.

335
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,868
I think so.

336
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,412
Honey, relationships are hard.
Like with your mom and me.

337
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,349
You know, after we graduated
from college, we broke up for a while.

338
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,021
It seems her father,
your grandfather...

339
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,851
...wanted her to travel
around Europe like he did.

340
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,857
Of course, he got to do it
on Uncle Sam's nickel...

341
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:21,123
...because he was also strafing
German troop trains at the time.

342
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,322
However...

343
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,104
Okay, here we go.

344
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,245
I am Jabba's prisoner.
And you...

345
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,582
...have a really weird look
on your face.

346
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,117
What? Honey, what is it?
Did I get the hair wrong?

347
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,812
Did you just picture it differently?
What?

348
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,289
No, no. It's not you.
It's...

349
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,395
What is it? Come on, sweetie.
You're, like, freaking me out here.

350
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,667
I hate Chandler.
The bastard ruined my life!
