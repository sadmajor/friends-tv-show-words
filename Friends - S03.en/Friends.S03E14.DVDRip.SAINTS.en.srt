1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,776
'Cause every time I see your face

2
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,941
I can't help but fall from grace

3
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,685
This girl's good.

4
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,684
Yeah, a song with rhyming words!
I never thought of that before.

5
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,026
I like her.

6
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:31,525
Why? Because she can both sing
and play guitar at the same time?

7
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,329
That's all I'm looking for
from these people.

8
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,102
Look at you, all jealous.

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,568
Come on, Pheebs. You two have
completely different styles.

10
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,435
She's more...
You know?

11
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,646
And you're more...

12
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,607
Say you'll stay beside me

13
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,786
See? Everybody else is
happy she's done.

14
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,294
Okay, my next song's called:

15
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,658
"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?
I Loved When We Were...

16
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,199
...Singing Partners and I Shouldn't
Have Left You That Way."

17
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,177
One of those "look for
the hidden meaning" songs.

18
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:27,316
The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner

19
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,551
Hey, Phoebe.

20
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:10,854
Hey, Leslie.

21
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,497
How'd you know I'd be here?

22
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,598
I saw Vlad at the place
where they sell the big fish.

23
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,564
He said you played here a lot, so...

24
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,461
I have to go to the bathroom.

25
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,707
If "big-fish place"
comes up again...

26
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,968
...I'd like to know if that's several
big fish or just one big fish.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,145
So Phoebe says you write jingles.

28
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,179
Actually, I said she abandoned me
to write jingles.

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,912
Anything we might've heard of?

30
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,316
Home is never far away

31
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,724
Home is Homestar Stew.

32
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,966
But I don't do that anymore.
I got kind of sick of it.

33
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,795
And then I couldn't come up with
anything good, so they fired me.

34
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,131
Bummer.

35
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,243
Well, you know, I was just...

36
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,879
I was just thinking
and just hoping that...

37
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,148
...maybe you'd want
to get back together?

38
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,183
No, but, thanks.

39
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,787
Come on, Phoebe.
Would you just think about it?

40
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,026
No, but, thanks.

41
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,567
See you, Pheebs.

42
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,001
That was kind of brutal.

43
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,905
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

44
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,510
Once you betray me,
I become like the Ice Woman.

45
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:39,582
I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.

46
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,255
You know, nothing can
penetrate this icy exterior.

47
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,820
Can I have a tissue?

48
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,356
Is someone in there?

49
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,762
I'm playing a daredevil game...

50
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,437
...called "Wait Until the Last Moment
Before I Burst and Die."

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,405
Jeez, man! Did you fall...?

52
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,609
Hi!

53
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,712
So did you?
Did you fall high?

54
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,906
Someone was in the ladies' room.
I couldn't wait.

55
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,242
I left the lid up for you, though.

56
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,579
You know what, Gunther?
Go ahead.

57
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,858
I'm talking to...

58
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,490
This is where you say your name.

59
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,685
Ginger.

60
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,365
Ginger.
I'm talking to Ginger, so...

61
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,063
Don't you have to use the bathroom?

62
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,139
No, I just...
I'd rather talk to you.

63
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,279
Yes, I do.

64
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,573
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

65
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,280
There's someone in here.

66
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,011
- Where's Chandler?
- He can't make it.

67
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,883
He said he had to go back
to his job and...

68
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,524
Joey?

69
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,091
Joey Tribbiani?

70
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,001
I can see you, okay?

71
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,298
You're hiding behind the coats.

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,578
Close one.

73
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,926
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

74
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,824
- Hello.
- Hey, Ross.

75
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,260
- I've got some bad news.
- What?

76
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,835
I can eat,
but I have to come back here.

77
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,100
Come on. You've worked late
every night for two weeks.

78
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,141
- What is it now?
- It's my fault. I quit today.

79
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,280
But work comes first!

80
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,775
But that's sad about you, though.
What happened?

81
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,510
What happened? Burn out?
Burn all out, did you?

82
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,617
He's leaving for a better job.

83
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,919
That's great.
So I guess this is goodbye then.

84
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,186
Goodbye.

85
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,801
Okay, then.

86
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,864
Well, we're gonna
miss you around here.

87
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,339
Yeah, me too.

88
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,172
- So see you on Saturday.
- Yeah, you bet!

89
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,224
Now, you know those
are a delicacy in India.

90
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,327
That was Leslie calling
to see if we can get back together.

91
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,667
It's like the 20th time today.
Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

92
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,511
She must've hurt you bad.

93
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,544
Well, yeah.
You know, we were best friends...

94
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,411
...ever since we were little.
Our moms worked on the barge together.

95
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,351
You two must've been so cute,
running around on a barge.

96
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,683
You never run on a barge!

97
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,755
Is Chandler around?

98
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,397
He met some girl at the coffeehouse.

99
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,193
Ginger something.

100
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:25,533
Sure it wasn't something that sounded
liked Ginger? Like "Gingeer"?

101
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,408
No, it was Ginger.

102
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,706
I remember because
when he told me, I said:

103
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,177
The movie star

104
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,447
Oh, man!
That's the girl I was hiding from.

105
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,351
When she sees he's my roommate,
she'll tell him what I did.

106
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,926
- What did you do?
- Oh, no! I can't...

107
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,462
I can't tell you. It's the
most awful thing I've ever done.

108
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,366
You're really not making us
want to hear it less.

109
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,699
Don't tell us.

110
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,534
We'll wait till Chandler gets home.
It'll be more fun that way.

111
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,174
It was, like, four years ago.

112
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,384
Ginger and I had gone out a few times.
Then one weekend...

113
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,076
...we went to her Dad's cabin...

114
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,155
...just me, her and her
annoying little dog, Pepper.

115
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,451
That night I cooked
this really romantic dinner...

116
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,560
You gave her food poisoning!

117
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,031
I wish.

118
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,199
After dinner, me, her and Pepper
fell asleep in front of the fire.

119
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,904
I woke up in the middle of the night
and saw the fire was dying out...

120
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,766
...so I picked up a log
and threw it on.

121
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,643
Or what I thought was a log.

122
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,373
Oh, my God!
You threw Pepper on the fire!

123
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,376
I wish.

124
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,383
Another thing I probably
should've told you about Ginger...

125
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,924
...is that she kind of has a...

126
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,720
...artificial leg.

127
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,370
Oh, my God!

128
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,033
You threw it on the fire?

129
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,471
She must've freaked out.

130
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,579
Yeah, she must've.

131
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,078
- You don't know?
- Well...

132
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:16,244
What did you do after
you threw her leg on the fire?

133
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,689
I ran!

134
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,791
- You ran?
- Through the woods, with no socks on.

135
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,030
That's the best kiss I've had...

136
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,742
...with anybody I met
in a men's room.

137
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:39,970
Actually, me too.

138
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,105
Foot all in the puddle!

139
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,180
Damn! I hate that!

140
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,445
- You'll have to get out of those shoes.
- Don't worry.

141
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,552
No, really.
You're gonna freeze.

142
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,121
No, I'm not.

143
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,359
You're not?
Have you got a bionic foot?

144
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,362
Someday. Maybe.

145
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,437
Funny book?

146
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,815
I'm just thinking about
something funny I heard today.

147
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,220
Mark saying,
"I'll see you Saturday."

148
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,688
Yeah, at the lecture.

149
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,759
I told you last week.
You said you didn't mind.

150
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,860
It's not the lecture I mind.

151
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,198
Please tell me it's not because
I'm going with Mark.

152
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,699
- Well...
- Oh, my God!

153
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,972
I'm sorry, but if you're not
working with him anymore...

154
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,143
...why do you still hang out?

155
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,072
Because he's my friend.

156
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,773
But do you really need
another "friend"?

157
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,052
If I stop playing with Joey
and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

158
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,218
Is that funny?
Am I suppose to be laughing?

159
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,089
I don't know. You thought
"See you Saturday" was funny.

160
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,027
Mark is in fashion.

161
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,325
I like having a friend
I can share this stuff with.

162
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,731
You guys would never
go to a lecture with me.

163
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,633
- I'd love to go with you.
- Really?

164
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,806
I have clothes.

165
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,478
I even pick them out.

166
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,218
For all you know,
I could be a fashion...

167
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:27,975
...monger.

168
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,958
I would love for you to go with me.

169
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,892
What?

170
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,832
What should I wear?
Now I'm all nervous.

171
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,209
You know, they say
"A watched pot never beeps."

172
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,113
It's been a couple hours...

173
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,646
...and she hasn't called.

174
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,512
Not that I even care. I don't.

175
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,291
Why don't you just call her?

176
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,528
You obviously want to.

177
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,820
You think you know me so well.

178
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,756
Well, don't you wanna?

179
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,825
So I do know you.

180
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,569
That's what I said.

181
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,375
- Well, so?
- I can't.

182
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,071
I can't. She dumped me.

183
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,779
I totally trusted her,
then one day it was like:

184
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,006
"Okay, bye, Pheebs."
Gone!

185
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,846
You know what the saddest part is?

186
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,520
When we were playing together,
that was...

187
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,850
...the most fun I've ever had
in all my lives.

188
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,764
My favorite shoes, so good to me
I wear them every day

189
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:54,005
Down at the heel, holes in the toes
Don't care what people say

190
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,037
My feet's best friend
Pals to the end

191
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,869
With them, I'm one hot chickie

192
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,545
Though late one night
Not much light

193
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,310
I stepped in something icky

194
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,851
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

195
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,650
Always make me smile

196
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:20,958
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Next time I'll...

197
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,799
...avoid the...

198
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,765
...pile!

199
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,816
We're beginning to see a lot of
layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

200
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,348
For instance, a sheer navy blouse
over a pink...

201
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,020
I'm really glad we came.

202
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,392
You're so pretty.

203
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,897
I love you.

204
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,471
Smelly cat, smelly cat

205
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,403
What are they feeding you?

206
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,907
Smelly cat, smelly cat

207
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,876
It's not your fault

208
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,009
- That's great!
- Yeah?

209
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,382
You know, you could totally sell this.

210
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,558
It'd be perfect for, like,
a kitty-litter campaign.

211
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,293
A jingle?

212
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,455
Why not?
You'd make a ton of money.

213
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:30,190
If I was in this for the money,
I'd be a millionaire by now.

214
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,337
You gotta get out of
that jingle-head.

215
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,102
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

216
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,344
That's okay.

217
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,673
I'm gonna play a song now
that's really, really sad.

218
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,748
It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up."

219
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,717
Oversized bracelets,
oversized earrings...

220
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:58,019
...oversizing of accessories,
in general, is very popular now.

221
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,907
Can I borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.

222
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,145
I hate that.

223
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,643
I once had a thing of half-and-half.
Stole my car.

224
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,577
So how was your date with Ginger?

225
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,253
Great.

226
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,947
It was great. She's...

227
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,126
She's great. Great looks
and personality. Greatness.

228
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,356
Sounds like she's got the...

229
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,333
...whole package.

230
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,204
So she's got it all, huh?

231
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,802
She's the real deal?

232
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,009
Joey told you about the leg, huh?

233
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,747
Oh, God!
It freaked me out.

234
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,609
It shouldn't, but it did.

235
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,377
I wanna keep seeing her,
but it's like:

236
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,055
"Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg?"

237
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,393
I'm the smallest person in the world,
aren't I?

238
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,963
Morning.

239
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,001
Actually, he's the smallest person
in the world.

240
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,968
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

241
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,808
It came up.

242
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,417
Listen, I know it's a long shot, but...

243
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,785
...by any chance,
did she find that funny?

244
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,087
So I nodded off a little!

245
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,356
"Nodded off"?
Ross, you were snoring!

246
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,763
My father's boat didn't make
that much noise when it hit rocks!

247
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,405
Come on! Forty-five minutes...

248
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,703
Forty-five minutes, the man talked
about strappy-backed dresses.

249
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:58,383
Okay, how about four hours
in a freezing museum auditorium...

250
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,879
...listening to
Professor "Pitstains" say:

251
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,485
"Remember that thing that died
a gazillion years ago?

252
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,055
Well, here's a little bone
we didn't know it had!"

253
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,466
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

254
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,592
And second of all,
that little bone proved that...

255
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,204
...that particular dinosaur had wings
but didn't fly.

256
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,534
Okay, you know what I just heard?

257
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,681
A hundred million people
went to see a movie about what I do.

258
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,413
I wonder how many people would go see
a movie called Jurassic Parka.

259
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,725
Oh, that is so...

260
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:45,453
A bunch of out-of-control jackets
take over an island!

261
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,964
If what I do is so lame...

262
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,801
...then why did you insist on coming
with me this morning?

263
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,943
Was it so I just wouldn't
go with Mark?

264
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,475
I wanted to be with you.

265
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,411
I don't know, I feel like lately...

266
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,621
...you're slipping away from me...

267
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,290
...with this new job
and all these new people.

268
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,255
And you've got this
whole other life going on.

269
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,429
I know it's dumb...

270
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,793
...but I just hate
that I'm not a part of it.

271
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,705
It's not dumb.

272
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,469
But maybe it's okay
that you're not a part of it.

273
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,939
You know what I mean?

274
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,573
I mean, it's like...

275
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,980
...I like that you're not
involved in that part of my life.

276
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,482
That's a little clearer.

277
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,486
See, it doesn't mean
I don't love you...

278
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,921
...because I do.
I love you so much.

279
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,529
But my work...
It's for me, you know?

280
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,301
I'm out there on my own,
and I'm doing it.

281
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,630
And it's scary,
but I love it because it's mine.

282
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,532
But I mean, is that okay?

283
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,170
Sure.

284
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,221
You're thinking about my leg.

285
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,223
Actually, I forgot.
What's the deal with that again?

286
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,293
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

287
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,399
I only need to know
how much it bothers you...

288
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,865
...because I don't like
wasting my time.

289
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,102
Am I wasting my time?

290
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,535
No, I don't think so.

291
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:42,076
It's like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.

292
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,618
What's that?

293
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,725
That's my "nubbin."

294
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,034
What's a nubbin?

295
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,241
It's kind of a third-nipple
kind of thing.

296
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,400
You have three nipples?

297
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,636
Well, you know, two regulars...

298
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,614
...and one that
barely qualifies as a...

299
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,119
- What?
- Nothing. You know, I...

300
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,550
I just remembered.
I have to leave.

301
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,193
You have to leave? Now? How come?

302
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,193
Well, it's nubbin.
Nothing!

303
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,533
You know what?
I'll see you later.

304
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,478
I thought you weren't coming.

305
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,106
- Where were you?
- Come here, come here.

306
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,177
Don't get mad, okay?

307
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,149
Don't give me a reason to get mad,
okay?

308
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:01,792
I played Smelly Cat for
my old ad agency. They went nuts!

309
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,326
I told you I didn't want you
to try and sell it...

310
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,896
...and you just big, fat did it anyway!

311
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,469
I think, five years ago,
I probably would have done anything...

312
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,071
...to play with you.

313
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,708
But I can do it myself.
If I can't trust you, then forget it.

314
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,679
I don't wanna forget it.

315
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,642
You know what?
You have to choose.

316
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,976
If the most important thing
on the planet to you...

317
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:32,316
...is this cat-poopy thing,
then you can have Smelly Cat.

318
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,491
But we won't be partners.

319
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,593
So, what's it gonna be?

320
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,093
- Smelly cat, smelly cat
- Problem odor in the litter box?

321
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,665
Don't change your kitty,
change your kitty litter.

322
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,400
It's not your fault

323
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,665
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Yeah.

324
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,105
You okay?

325
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,043
I actually am.

326
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,910
Because, you know, life's gonna
hand you all kinds of stuff.

327
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,187
You learn your little lessons
and hopefully you grow.

328
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,017
- You wanna hear a new song?
- We'd love to.

329
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,489
Jingle bitch screwed me over

330
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,326
Go to hell, jingle whore

331
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,559
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

332
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,297
That's all I have so far.

333
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,644
Well, hello!

334
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,577
- Where you been?
- The doctor.

335
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,147
Is everything okay?

336
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,885
Just had me
a little nubbin-ectomy.

337
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,318
Two nipples, no waiting.

338
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,926
Well! Just like Rachel
in high school.

339
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,264
What?

340
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,328
Come on, I was kidding!
It was such an obvious joke.

341
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,366
That was an obvious joke.

342
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,639
And I didn't think of it. Why?

343
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,898
The source of all my powers.

344
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,112
Oh, dear God, what have I done?
