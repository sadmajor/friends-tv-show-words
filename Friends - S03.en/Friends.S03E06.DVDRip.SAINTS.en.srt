1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,899
Janice has a question.
Who of the six of you...

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,803
...has slept with
who of the six of you?

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,309
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,775
I'm sorry, the answer there
would be none of us.

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,212
Yeah. You know what?
If that doesn't change soon...

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,945
...I'm going to dump you
for somebody who puts out.

7
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,751
Come on. Over the years, none of you
ever got, you know, drunk and stupid?

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,588
Well, that's really
a different question.

9
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,364
I find it hard to believe
that a group of people who spends...

10
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:37,297
...as much time together as you
guys do has never bumped uglies.

11
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,930
Well, there was that one time
that Monica and Rachel got together.

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,875
- What?
- What?

13
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,676
Excuse me, there was no time.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,405
Okay, but let's say there was.

15
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,311
How might that go?

16
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,719
Okay. Okay.
Well, then answer me this:

17
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:59,981
Have any of you ever almost...?

18
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,656
- Anybody need more coffee?
- Hey, there's a dog out there!

19
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:12,870
The One With the Flashback

20
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,042
- That is so unfortunate.
- What?

21
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,845
Cute Naked Guy's really
starting to put on weight.

22
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,422
I'll be back in just a minute.

23
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:09,060
Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry that I left
lipstick marks on the phone.

24
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,730
You didn't leave lipstick marks
on the phone.

25
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,762
Then it must have been you. Bye.

26
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,936
Bye-bye.

27
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,338
- That's why I moved out.
- Hey, while we're on that...

28
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,102
...when are you gonna tell my sister
you don't live here anymore?

29
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,510
I think on some level,
she already knows.

30
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,282
She doesn't know that
you sneak out every night.

31
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,178
She doesn't know
that you sneak back...

32
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,615
...and she doesn't know you've been
at your grandmother's for a week.

33
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,857
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

34
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,991
You have got to tell her.

35
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,684
The longer you wait,
the harder it is going to be on her.

36
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,262
You're right. You're right.

37
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,660
Anyway, listen, tonight's bag...

38
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,267
...is really bulky.
So could you sneak stuff out for me?

39
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,938
It's just like a clock radio
and some cemetery dirt.

40
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,469
- Hey.
- Hey.

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,874
I'm never gonna find a roommate.
Ever.

42
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,014
Nobody good?

43
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,742
Well, let's see.
There was the guy with the ferrets.

44
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:07,920
That's plural.

45
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,781
The spitter. And the guy
who enjoyed my name so much...

46
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,754
...he felt the need to make
a noise every time he said it.

47
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,590
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

48
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,299
"Great apartment, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

49
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,470
- How many more do you have tomorrow?
- Two.

50
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,935
This photographer
who seemed really dull...

51
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,507
...and this actor guy who
I'm not sure about because...

52
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,644
...when I answered the phone
"Chandler Bing"...

53
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,347
...he said, "Whoa! Short message!"

54
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,745
Foot on the floor
or come over no more.

55
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,857
Sure, your dresser is missing,
but this she notices.

56
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,083
- What?
- I have to go.

57
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,262
Carol should be home by now, so...

58
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,227
- How's it going with you guys?
- Better, actually.

59
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,734
I think I finally figured out why we
were having so much trouble lately.

60
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,429
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. You know how I have you guys?

61
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,233
She doesn't have any close
friends that are just hers.

62
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:09,108
But last week, she met this woman
at the gym, Susan something.

63
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:14,009
And they really hit it off, and
I think it's gonna make a difference.

64
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,251
So, Eric...

65
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,583
...what kind of photography do you do?

66
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,294
Oh, mostly fashion.

67
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,395
So there may be models here
sometimes. I hope that's cool.

68
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,100
Yes, that is cool.

69
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,236
Because I have models here,
you know...

70
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,530
...never.

71
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,209
What else?

72
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,811
During the summer I spend most
weekends at my sister's beach house...

73
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,675
...which you are welcome to use.

74
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,418
Although I should probably tell you,
she's a porn star.

75
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,788
Well, listen, I still have
one more person to meet...

76
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,926
...but unless it turns out
to be your sister...

77
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,792
...I think your chances
are pretty good.

78
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,657
All right.

79
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,967
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

80
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,141
This right here is the kitchen,
and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

81
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,345
Don't you wanna
ask me any questions?

82
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,240
Sure.

83
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,877
What's up?

84
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,778
Well, I'm an actor.

85
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,184
I'm fairly neat.

86
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,224
I got my own TV.

87
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,989
Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally
okay with the gay thing.

88
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,196
What gay thing?

89
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,064
Just, you know, in general.
The whole people being gay thing.

90
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,976
Totally cool with that.

91
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,206
Okay, Jerry.
Thanks for stopping by.

92
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,917
- Hi.
- Hey.

93
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,550
Oh, my God!

94
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,326
Hey, Mon.

95
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,772
- Wanna hear something that sucks?
- Do I ever!

96
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,739
- Chris says they're closing down the bar.
- No way!

97
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,175
Apparently, they're turning
it into a coffee place.

98
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,678
Just coffee?

99
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,147
- Where are we gonna hang out now?
- You got me.

100
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,843
- Can I get a beer, please?
- Hey, did you pick a roommate?

101
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,022
- You betcha.
- Is it the Italian guy?

102
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,524
Yeah, right.

103
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,227
He's so cute.

104
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,090
That's what I want.
A roommate I can walk around with...

105
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,663
...and be referred to as the funny one.

106
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,700
Pool table's free. Rack them up.
Back in a minute.

107
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,098
Get ready for me to whip your butt.

108
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,433
Okay, but after that,
we're shooting some pool.

109
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,611
No, no, no, no.
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

110
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,977
My friend ordered an onion...

111
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,047
...not an olive.

112
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,153
And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke...

113
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,584
...which I don't think this is.

114
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,051
- I am so sorry.
- That's all right.

115
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,589
I mean, how hard is it to get
a couple drinks right, huh?

116
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,494
I would like to propose a toast...

117
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,198
...to the woman who, in one year
from today, will become...

118
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,671
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S.

119
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,371
I think it's time
to see the ring again.

120
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,347
Isn't it exciting? I mean,
it's like having a boyfriend for life.

121
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,424
Yeah. I know.

122
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,423
What?

123
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,656
Oh, I don't know.

124
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,336
Well, maybe it's just the idea...

125
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,129
...of Barry for the rest of my life.

126
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,968
I don't know, I think I...
I feel like I need to have one last fling...

127
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,178
...you know, just to sort of get it
out of my system.

128
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,111
- Rachel, stop!
- You're so bad!

129
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,016
I'm serious. I really think
I need to just have...

130
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,382
...some meaningless sex,
you know?

131
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,354
With the next guy I see.

132
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,159
Excuse me, I seem to have
dropped my ball.

133
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,229
Yeah, so?

134
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,275
And now I've picked it up again.

135
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,413
My God!
I went to high school with her.

136
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,086
Rachel!

137
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,652
Hi!

138
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,119
Monica!

139
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,091
Is she giving me the finger?

140
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,994
Monica!

141
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,665
Look! Hi! What do you think?

142
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,194
Oh, my God!

143
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,129
You can't even see
where the Titanic hit it.

144
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,640
Yes, his name is Barry.
He's a doctor, thank you very much.

145
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,106
Just like you always wanted.
Congratulations.

146
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:09,145
Thank you. So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

147
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,679
Not right now.

148
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,641
Oh, well, that's okay.

149
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:14,920
I know.

150
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,857
So I think I'll get back
to my friend.

151
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,393
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

152
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,430
Listen, can we please have lunch
the next time I'm in the city?

153
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,763
That'd be great.

154
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:33,939
- Okay.
- Thanks.

155
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,801
- Bye.
- Bye.

156
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:40,041
Ten bucks says I never see
that woman again in my life.

157
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,146
No, honey, really. It's fine.

158
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,611
Just...

159
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:45,875
Go with Susan.

160
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,244
Really, I think...

161
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,545
I think girls' night out
is a great idea.

162
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,287
Okay. Okay. Bye.

163
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,093
- So, what are they doing?
- I don't know. Something girly.

164
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,263
Hey, you're early.

165
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,434
What are you doing with the lamp?

166
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,906
I'm just taking it to get rewired.

167
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:14,475
Don't take it to the place you took the
stereo. They've had that for over a week.

168
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,422
No! Mr. Heckles, no one is making
any noise up here.

169
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,325
You're disturbing my oboe practice.

170
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,826
- You don't play the oboe.
- I could play the oboe.

171
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,064
Then I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep it down.

172
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,997
Who are you?

173
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm Eric, I'm gonna be
Chandler's new roommate.

174
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,041
I'm Chandler's new roommate.

175
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,880
- I don't think so.
- I could be Chandler's new roommate.

176
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,518
- But he told me over the phone...
- He told me in person.

177
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,845
That's weird.

178
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,219
Well, I'm going to go into
my new apartment now.

179
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,540
Hi, again.

180
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,404
Hey.

181
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,321
Hey.

182
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,955
Thank you so much.

183
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,522
No, no, no. Don't thank me.
Thank the jerk that didn't show up.

184
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,659
Okay, I gotta get to work.

185
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,558
And not just for the money.
But because every now and then...

186
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:43,895
...someone walks out of the bathroom with
a little bit of toilet paper on their shoe.

187
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,534
- You need some help with that?
- No, thanks. I got it.

188
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,371
No. No, I don't!

189
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,807
Okay?

190
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,051
Stood up too fast.
Got a little head rush.

191
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,385
It's the heat.

192
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,385
And the humidity.

193
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,124
That's a...

194
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,160
That's a tough combination.

195
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,103
Do you want to come in
for some lemonade?

196
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,540
Like you wouldn't believe.

197
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,008
This is a great place.

198
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,340
Thank you.

199
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,685
Just make yourself comfortable.

200
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,887
Gotcha.

201
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,452
So this place is really
my grandmother's.

202
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,735
I got it from her
when she moved to Florida.

203
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,132
Otherwise I could never
afford a place like this.

204
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,668
So if the landlord ever asks...

205
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,607
...I'm an 87-year-old woman who's
afraid of her VCR. You thirsty?

206
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,874
You bet I am!

207
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,385
Okay...

208
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,951
...here's your penis!

209
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,486
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

210
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,924
You said, "You wanna come
in for some lemonade?"

211
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,461
So?

212
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,568
Were you just gonna give me lemonade?

213
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,094
Cover yourself up!

214
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,765
Oh, right. Sorry.

215
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,531
God, I don't believe this!

216
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,506
Someone asks you in for lemonade and to
you that means they want to have sex?

217
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,647
Usually, yeah.
Well, not just lemonade.

218
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,077
Iced tea, sometimes juice.

219
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,013
Look, sorry. I just...

220
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,984
I thought you liked me.

221
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,054
I'm such a jerk.

222
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,317
It's okay.

223
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,062
I suppose it could happen to anyone.

224
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,062
Not anyone I know, but...

225
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,403
By the way, I can still see it.

226
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,283
- Pheebs?
- Huh?

227
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,612
Where's your bed?

228
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,021
It's not in the apartment?

229
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,221
Oh, no.

230
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,224
I can't believe this
is happening again.

231
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,794
- What?
- Okay, enough with the third degree!

232
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,107
I don't live here anymore.

233
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,737
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

234
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,983
I don't live here anymore.

235
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,846
I didn't know how to tell you.
But, you know, everybody else knows.

236
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,352
Everybody knows?

237
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,028
That was supposed to be a good thing.
I forget why.

238
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,161
I don't understand.
I thought we were doing better lately.

239
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,359
Yeah, 'cause I moved out.

240
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,530
Monica, I...

241
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,470
Do you know, okay, I couldn't
sleep for, like, a month...

242
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,941
...because I got a dot of ink
on one of the sofa cushions?

243
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,808
Well, you could've just
turned the cushion over.

244
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,008
I would have, except I had
a spaghetti stain on the other side.

245
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,353
What?

246
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,453
Okay. This is what I'm talking about.

247
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,214
I need to live in a land
where people can spill!

248
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,952
Well, you can spill.

249
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,926
In the sink.

250
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:37,030
Oh, honey. It's not your fault,
you know. This is who you are.

251
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,272
And I love you.
And I want us to be friends.

252
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,168
And if I keep living here,
I don't see that happening.

253
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,711
- I love you too.
- Oh, good.

254
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,677
What?

255
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,344
What? I'm just sad.

256
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,749
No, you're not.
You're wondering which cushion it is.

257
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,795
Well, why can't I think of both?
I mean, I can think two things.

258
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,591
Go ahead. Look.
You know you want to. Go.

259
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,663
Oh, my God!

260
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,705
- So, what are you watching?
- Baywatch.

261
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,442
What's it about?

262
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,451
Lifeguards.

263
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,780
Well, it sounds kind of stup...

264
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,324
Who's she?

265
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,087
Nicole Eggert.

266
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,195
We like her.

267
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,930
Wow! Look at them run!

268
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,705
They do that a lot.

269
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,072
Hey, you want a beer?

270
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,543
- Yeah, I'll go get one.
- Don't get up. I got a cooler right here.

271
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,618
- Hello!
- Hey.

272
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,321
Do you have any beers?
We're out of beers.

273
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,457
Help yourself.

274
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,391
You okay?

275
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,430
Phoebe moved out.

276
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,502
Right.

277
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,703
I don't understand.

278
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:24,534
Am I so hard to live with?
Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?

279
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,835
No!

280
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,139
You don't have a boyfriend because...

281
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,576
I don't know why
you don't have a boyfriend.

282
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,283
You should have a boyfriend.

283
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,314
Well, I think so.

284
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,149
Come here.

285
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,417
Come here.

286
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,329
Listen, you are one
of my favorite people...

287
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,698
...and the most beautiful woman
I've ever known in real life.

288
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,484
Hi.

289
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,851
Where is everybody?

290
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:17,119
Oh, it's already closed. Chris gave me
the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

291
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,490
I think my marriage...

292
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,893
...is kind of over.

293
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,197
Oh, no! Why?

294
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,564
Because Carol's a lesbian.

295
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,909
And...

296
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,600
And I'm not one.

297
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,515
And apparently it's not
a mix-and-match situation.

298
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,744
Oh, my God!

299
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,645
I don't believe it!

300
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,656
Oh, you poor bunny.

301
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,554
I'm an idiot.

302
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,362
I mean, I should have seen it.

303
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:58,764
I mean, Carol and I would be out,
and she'd see some beautiful woman...

304
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,997
...and she'd be, "Ross! Look at her!"

305
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:07,178
And I'd think, "God, my wife is cool."

306
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,119
Hey, do you think
that Susan person is her lover?

307
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,693
Well, now I do!

308
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,429
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,464
Seven years!

310
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,831
I mean, we've been together
seven years.

311
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,134
She's the only woman
who's ever loved me.

312
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,966
She's the only woman I've ever...

313
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,438
Oh, Ross.

314
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,676
This is nice.

315
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,580
I know. It is, isn't it?

316
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,382
No, I mean it.
This feels really good.

317
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,356
Is it a hundred percent cotton?

318
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,961
Yeah.
And I got it on sale too.

319
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,034
I mean, it looks nubby, but...

320
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,732
But it's not.

321
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:13,978
Anyway, I should go.

322
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,343
One of the lifeguards was just about
to dismantle a nuclear device.

323
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,518
If you want to get
a drink later, we can.

324
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,187
That sounds great.

325
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:27,983
- Oh, and listen, it's gonna be...
- I know.

326
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,319
Thanks.

327
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:38,001
Maybe this wouldn't have happened
if I'd been more nurturing...

328
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,900
...or I'd paid more attention...

329
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,667
...or I had a uterus.

330
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,574
- I can't believe it.
- I know.

331
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,111
You know, you don't deserve this.
You don't, Ross. You're really...

332
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,079
- You're so good.
- Thanks.

333
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,047
And you're so sweet.

334
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,755
- Thanks.
- And you're kind.

335
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,218
Thanks.

336
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,433
Come here.

337
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,997
Wait, wait, wait.

338
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,879
Okay. It's okay.

339
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,246
Wait, wait, wait!
My foot is stuck in the pocket.

340
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,184
What?

341
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,222
- What?
- I can't get it out.

342
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,190
That's not something
a girl wants to hear.

343
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,830
Come on, don't start.

344
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,925
- What?
- Stupid balls are in the way.

345
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,212
Oh, well.

346
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:09,926
That probably wouldn't have been
the most constructive solution.

347
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,460
You have chalk on your face.

348
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:18,029
Oh, Ross, you're right. I don't know why
I always thought this was real grass.

349
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,608
Honey, you okay?

350
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,937
My wife's a lesbian.

351
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,746
Cool!

352
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,019
Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

353
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,783
- Hey.
- How's it going?

354
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,729
I can't believe you came back.

355
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,267
Don't say anything.

356
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,565
I don't wanna speak.
I don't wanna think.

357
00:22:55,774 --> 00:23:00,541
I just want you to take me and kiss me
and make love to me right here...

358
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,838
...right now.

359
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,112
Rachel.

360
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,655
Rachel!

361
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,384
- What?
- You missed the exit.

362
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:22,296
- Oh. Sorry.
- My God, what were you thinking about?

363
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,670
Barry.
