1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,802
You have got to try this cheesecake.

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,635
You know, I'm not that much
of a sweet tooth...

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,970
Oh, my God, it's so creamy!

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,175
That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had!

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,042
Where did you get this?

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,382
It was at the front door when I got
home. Somebody sent it to us.

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,982
This isn't addressed to you.

8
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,386
This is addressed
to Mrs. Braverman downstairs!

9
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,061
Thief!

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,296
I didn't read the box
before I opened it...

11
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,035
...and you can't return a box
after you opened it!

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,239
- Why not?
- Because it's too delicious!

13
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,274
You stole this cheesecake.
That's wrong.

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,911
No, it'll be okay because Mrs.
Braverman will send for a free one.

15
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,774
That way, we all win.

16
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,748
The only losers are the
big cheesecake conglomerate...

17
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,420
..."Mama's Little Bakery."

18
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,892
I feel terrible.

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,524
I'm a horrible, horrible person.

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,388
I'm sorry, what?

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,196
The One With All The Cheesecakes

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,902
I should get going. Big day at work.

23
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,072
You know how I'm in a coma?

24
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,167
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.

25
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,104
So...

26
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,837
Mr. Smarty Pants.

27
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,312
It's just my character
that's not brain-dead.

28
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,081
Pheebs, still on for tonight?

29
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,480
- Absolutely.
- I'll see you at 8.

30
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,223
What's at 8?

31
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:10,155
Dinner. We get together about once
a month to discuss the rest of you.

32
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,425
Wow! Did not know that.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,134
May I say how lovely you look today?

34
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,334
Duly noted.

35
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,665
So for tomorrow, do you want to
rent a car and drive down together?

36
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,309
- What are you talking about?
- Cousin Frannie's wedding.

37
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,604
You were invited?

38
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,150
No.

39
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,545
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

40
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,118
I thought only Mom and Dad
were invited.

41
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,326
From the ages of 7 to 9,
Frannie and I were inseparable.

42
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,189
Maybe since the age of 9,
Frannie's made some new friends.

43
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,298
Do you wanna make some new friends?

44
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,263
It's probably just a mistake.
Let me call Aunt Cheryl.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,637
Maybe you are invited and the
invitation got lost in the mail.

46
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,778
You call her and tell her
that when we were kids...

47
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,108
...her precious Frannie
tried to undress me several times.

48
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,784
If I hadn't stopped her, there
wouldn't be a wedding to go to.

49
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,647
She tried to undress me too.

50
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,815
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.

51
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,666
Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
are you home yet?

52
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,903
I think he's still out.
What's wrong?

53
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,403
I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Greene.

54
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,475
I had plans with Joey,
and he left me this note.

55
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,043
"Pheebs, can't make it.
Got a date. Talk to you later.

56
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,806
Big Daddy."

57
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,649
- "Big Daddy"?
- That's a nickname we were trying.

58
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,583
Why didn't you guys try "Francis"?

59
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,422
Francis is a cooler name than Chandler,
isn't it?

60
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,325
You know what nickname
never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron."

61
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,738
Here's Joseph Francis!

62
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,066
Wait, what are you
middle-naming me for?

63
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,675
I left you a note.

64
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,072
That doesn't give you the
right to ditch me!

65
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,076
You can cancel plans with friends
if there's a possibility for sex.

66
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,342
He's right. That is the rule.

67
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,247
- Really?
- Well, that's what I hear.

68
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,083
I've never gotten a chance
to actually employ the rule.

69
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,526
I don't accept it. When we make
plans, I expect you to show up.

70
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,790
I'm not a way to kill time
till you meet someone better.

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,503
Boyfriends and girlfriends will
come and go, but this is for life.

72
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,638
I'm so sorry. I had no idea
it would bother you this much.

73
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,136
Well, it does.

74
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,401
Well, can I make it up to you?

75
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,838
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,843
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I'll pay for myself.

77
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,949
Okay, you wore me down.

78
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,749
While you're over there, how
about a beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?

79
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,826
"Ross..." Is that back?

80
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,669
The other cheesecake came.

81
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,206
They delivered it here again.

82
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,740
Just bring it downstairs.
What's the problem?

83
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,812
I can't seem to say goodbye.

84
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,311
Are you serious?

85
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,646
We ate an entire cake
two days ago and you want more?

86
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,390
Well, I've forgotten
what it tastes like.

87
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,422
It was cheesecake. It was fine.

88
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,324
It had a buttery, crumbly,
graham cracker crust...

89
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,260
...with a very rich...

90
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,266
...yet light cream cheese filling.

91
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,739
Wow, my whole mouth
just filled with saliva.

92
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,236
Know what? Forget it.
We're just hungry.

93
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,845
We haven't had lunch.
We're just lightheaded.

94
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,381
So let's go have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake.

95
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,950
We'll drop it off
so we're not tempted.

96
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,249
- Where do you want to eat?
- Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago.

97
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,629
Mel Tormé died.

98
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,367
Joey, that paper's like a year old.

99
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,935
Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale
is over?

100
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,803
So I finally heard back
from Aunt Cheryl...

101
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,444
...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.

102
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,408
There's limited seating...

103
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:28,143
Limited seating? I am just
one tiny person!

104
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,853
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

105
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,523
I mean, the last time she saw you...

106
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,626
...you'd have turned one of those
little wedding chairs into kindling.

107
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,992
"Limited seating."
That's such a lame excuse.

108
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,635
That's not the reason
she's not inviting me.

109
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,566
What's the big deal? I wasn't invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.

110
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:53,039
If it makes you feel any better, Joan
and I will just make an appearance...

111
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,440
...and then we'll leave early
as a sign of protest.

112
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,844
- Joan?
- Yeah, my date.

113
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,919
Assistant professor in linguistics.
Tall, very beautiful.

114
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:07,318
And despite what some people say,
not broad-backed.

115
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,319
Wait a minute.
You got "Ross Geller and Guest"?

116
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,690
I wasn't invited,
and you got "and Guest"?

117
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,925
Excuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behalf.

118
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,033
I think the rule applies here.

119
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,364
Since he has a chance
to get on broad-back...

120
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,834
Not broad-back!

121
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,409
Dude, I've seen her.
She's like a billboard.

122
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,313
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.

123
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,051
I can't cancel on Joan.

124
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,184
- Why not?
- Did you not hear me?

125
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:39,050
She's an assistant professor
in the linguistics department.

126
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,223
They're wild.

127
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,955
- Why do you want to come anyway?
- Because...

128
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,563
...she's my cousin.

129
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,528
I mean, we grew up together.

130
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,431
Family, you know?
And all that's important to me.

131
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,506
Okay, all right. I'll take you.

132
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,436
I'll go call Joan.

133
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,136
Oh, that's nice.

134
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,075
Family should be there.

135
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,341
It's her wedding.
Happiest day of her life.

136
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,175
We'll see.

137
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,754
Well, thank you for lunch.

138
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,857
Wait, I thought you paid.

139
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,689
Apparently, we don't pay
for food anymore.

140
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,092
- Do you see what I see?
- It's still there.

141
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,365
Mrs. Braverman must be out.

142
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,841
She could be out of town.
Maybe gone for months.

143
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,513
By then, it may spoil.
She can't come back to bad cheesecake.

144
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,547
- It could kill her.
- Don't want that.

145
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,841
We're protecting her.

146
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,280
- We'll take it.
- But quick.

147
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,317
- Why?
- I hear her in there.

148
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,852
Go! Go! Go!

149
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,425
Do you think it's inappropriate to wear
a white, lacy dress to a wedding?

150
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,999
- Yes.
- Excellent.

151
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,300
Oh, my God, that's David.

152
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,404
- Who?
- David, the scientist guy.

153
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,507
David that I was in love with.

154
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,179
Who went to Russia
and broke my heart, David.

155
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,381
Oh, my God!

156
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,775
Say their name enough,
they turn around.

157
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,080
Phoebe.

158
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,185
David.

159
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,560
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?

160
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,456
I'm just in town for a conference.

161
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,156
God, you look phenomenal.

162
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,798
Well...

163
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,162
Yeah.

164
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,634
You look great too.
Did you get a haircut?

165
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,307
Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them.

166
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,138
Look, I got a confession to make.

167
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,541
I was hoping to run into you here.

168
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,310
I didn't know if I should call.
I was only in town a few days...

169
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,885
...and I didn't want to intrude
on your life.

170
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,852
I really wanted to see you...

171
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,888
...but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

172
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,994
Of course I would want to see you.
I think about you all the time.

173
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,099
Really? Because I think about you
all the time.

174
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,202
There's a statue in Minsk
that reminds me of you so much.

175
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,599
It's actually of Lenin...

176
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,902
...but, you know, at certain angles...

177
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,181
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?

178
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,675
Yes.

179
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,542
Oh, no!

180
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,884
- What?
- I can't.

181
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,248
I can't believe I have plans.
Can you do it tomorrow?

182
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:29,860
No, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.

183
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,653
Listen, next time you're in Minsk...

184
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,125
Phoebe? Can I talk to you
for a second?

185
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,801
What are you doing?

186
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,402
I have plans with Joey.

187
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,105
So? He'll understand.

188
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,934
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.

189
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:49,046
I made a whole speech about how
you do not cancel plans with friends.

190
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,774
And now just because, potentially,
the love of my life...

191
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,179
...returns from Russia
for one night...

192
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,082
...I should change my beliefs?

193
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,291
I should change my beliefs!

194
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:05,262
No. If I don't have my principles,
I don't have anything.

195
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,589
You're so strong.

196
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,699
Or I should rush through dinner
with Joey and meet David at 9.

197
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,867
Oh, my God, that is so good!

198
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,374
I'm full. And yet I know
if I stop eating this...

199
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,203
...I'll regret it.

200
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,746
Hey, what have you got there?

201
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,314
Oh, it's...

202
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,713
It's tofu cake. Want some?

203
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,522
What are you doing tonight?

204
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,920
Dude. Dude.

205
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,496
Sorry.

206
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,393
I got plans with Phoebe.

207
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,297
Really? Monica said
she had a date at 9.

208
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,131
- What? Tonight?
- That's what Monica said.

209
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:52,810
After that speech, she makes a date on
the same night she has plans with me?

210
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,674
She's trying to pull a fast one
on Big Daddy.

211
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,974
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- Dude, dude!

212
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,485
If I took off my pants right now,
how would you feel?

213
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,714
Like your cousin Glenn.

214
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,396
Here, I think this is us.

215
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,069
Limited seating, my ass.

216
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,295
Let's see who made the cut.

217
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,370
Hi. I'm Monica Geller.

218
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,873
- How do you know the bride and groom?
- I worked with Frannie.

219
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,340
Used to work with her. Used to.

220
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,674
I'm a relative
and I didn't get invited.

221
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,314
A blood relative. Blood.

222
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,550
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.

223
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:42,160
From the ages of 7 to 9, we were
inseparable, and I didn't even get invited!

224
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,328
Then why are you here?

225
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,361
- I'm my brother's date.
- Hey, I had a date, okay?

226
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,865
Joan Tedeschi, the linguist.

227
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,637
So how about you?
How do you know the happy couple?

228
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,933
We went to college with both of them.

229
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,144
Now we live next door.

230
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,744
Okay, you're fine.

231
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,706
You know, you would've liked Joan,
she's very pleasant.

232
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,347
There! There! Her back looks like that.
That's not broad, is it?

233
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,653
Come on, Joey, you've got to be ready
to order by now.

234
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,061
You know, I don't I like this table
either. Maybe we should move again.

235
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,328
No, we're staying right here.
Excuse me, we're ready to order.

236
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,971
I don't work here.

237
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,100
Well, then you shouldn't be
walking around.

238
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,004
- Are you guys ready?
- Yes.

239
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:40,309
I'll have a green salad,
house dressing and water's fine.

240
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,018
And for you, sir?

241
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,779
Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...

242
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,456
...how slow are we talking?

243
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,484
It's already been roasted.

244
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,390
Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear
the specials again.

245
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,167
We've heard the specials three times.

246
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:00,235
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very special lobster ravioli.

247
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,908
- Actually, we're out of the ravioli.
- Well, that changes everything!

248
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,173
You know what, Pheebs?
You were right before.

249
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,279
Friends are so important.

250
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,677
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.

251
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,418
Know what I really want?

252
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,723
- What?
- Is to have a long, long talk.

253
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,755
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and really open him up.

254
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,490
- Any progress?
- Yes.

255
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,393
I will have the lobster ravioli.

256
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,429
God, Joey, this is taking forever.

257
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,204
- What's the rush?
- Well...

258
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,964
...I have an appointment.

259
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,937
And it's very important.

260
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,336
What is it?

261
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,406
Well...

262
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,976
...it's a date.

263
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:47,548
A date? No, you must be mistaken,
because you wouldn't have a date...

264
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,288
...on the same night
you have plans with a friend.

265
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,352
Don't make me feel badly.

266
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,956
No, I'm gonna!

267
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,953
You made me feel really guilty
about going out with that girl.

268
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,964
Like I did something terrible.
Now you're doing the same thing.

269
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,363
It's not! It's totally different!

270
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,664
This is with David.
Remember David, the scientist guy?

271
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,375
He's very special to me.

272
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,975
My girl the other night was special.
She was a scientist too.

273
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,044
- She was?
- Well, she graduated high school.

274
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,407
Whatever. Know what?

275
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,119
He's only here for four
hours and I'm gonna go see him.

276
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,947
- Fine!
- Yeah.

277
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,959
What are you still doing here?
I told you, lobster ravioli!

278
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,398
I was about to leave.
I didn't think you were coming.

279
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,730
I wouldn't have missed this.

280
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,970
Well, I'm very glad you're here.

281
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,533
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

282
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,744
Come on, we're going to my place.

283
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,651
Are you eating the cheesecake
without me?

284
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,683
I will give you $ 100
to whistle right now.

285
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,800
- How can you eat it without me?
- What'll you do?

286
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,832
Tell Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to tell them everything.

287
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,733
We're dessert stealers.
We're living outside the law.

288
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,137
I don't trust you with this cake.

289
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,676
I got it first,
and I'm taking it back!

290
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,575
- What? Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

291
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,380
You think I trust you with it?

292
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,018
No, we'll split it.

293
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,016
That's not fair. You had some.

294
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,985
I think Monica would be
very interested to know...

295
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,057
...that you called her cheesecake
"dry and mealy."

296
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,355
What do we use to split it?

297
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,799
All right, pick a half.

298
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,771
Well, this side looks bigger.

299
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,943
But there's more crust on this side.

300
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,836
Maybe if I measure it...

301
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,205
Pick a piece!

302
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,144
- All right, I pick that one.
- It's the smaller piece.

303
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,649
Okay. There you go.

304
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,718
Enjoy your half, my friend.
But that is it.

305
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,187
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...

306
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,622
...if you eat your piece too fast.

307
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:24,298
- You gonna give me some of yours?
- Oh, no.

308
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:28,579
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.

309
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,541
I may just sit here
and have my cake all day.

310
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,751
Just sit here in the hallway
and eat my...

311
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,098
Ross, sweetheart!

312
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,096
Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.

313
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:54,169
- Isn't it a beautiful wedding?
- Yes, it is.

314
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,504
Every time, on the lips!

315
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,644
Why? Why on the lips?

316
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,150
There's Frannie.
Won't she be happy to see me?

317
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,183
You be nice, all right?

318
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,617
I didn't bring you to ambush her.

319
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,860
Frannie was the one
who showed your Playboys to Mom.

320
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,960
That bitch.

321
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,293
Monica!

322
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,694
What...?

323
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,268
Am I doing here?
Surprised to see me?

324
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,803
Ross brought me.
How do you like that?

325
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,374
Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.

326
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,171
You invite my whole family,
and not me? Why?

327
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,714
Why wouldn't you want me here?
What could I have done?

328
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,982
Stuart!

329
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,855
I believe you know my husband.

330
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,119
So it's really a question
of "who" could you have done.

331
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,736
I hate this, but I have to go.

332
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,033
I can't miss my flight.

333
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,505
I bet there's
another flight to Minsk in...

334
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,371
July.

335
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,084
That's really beautiful.
What does it mean?

336
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
"Please clean my beakers."

337
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,294
I don't get out of the lab much.

338
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,367
I thought it meant something else.

339
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,003
Yeah, well, I really actually
wanted to say...

340
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,706
...that.

341
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,274
But I figured I probably shouldn't
because...

342
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,907
...I have to leave.

343
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,480
No, you're right. Don't say it.

344
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,211
I do, though.

345
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,622
I do too.

346
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,795
Well, bye, Phoebe.

347
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:17,106
Now's not the time, Joey.
You can yell at me tomorrow.

348
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,976
Wait, no, Pheebs.
I'm not gonna yell at you.

349
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,719
I just started thinking
about you and David...

350
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,923
...and I remember how bummed you were
the first time he left.

351
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,992
Oh, Pheebs, come here.

352
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,322
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

353
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,228
The only guy I've ever been
crazy about is going to Minsk...

354
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,029
...and I may never see him again.

355
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,997
You could always visit him.

356
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,709
Right. Like they'll let me
have a passport.

357
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,742
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.

358
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,483
Well, now...

359
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,654
...if you achieve distillation of
subatomic particles before he does...

360
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,584
...then he could come back.

361
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,262
I could give it a shot.

362
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,470
Oh, look! There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

363
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,234
- Stick to your side!
- Come on, now!

364
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,818
All right, what are we having?

365
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,290
- Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.
- Oh, I'll wait here for you.

366
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,470
- I can't go back there!
- Why?

367
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,137
Did you see the way Stuart was staring
at me? I think he still wants me.

368
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,707
- Oh, my God.
- Just go do it!

369
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,139
All right, wait here.

370
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,395
Hi, sweetie! Are you leaving?

371
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,191
- Well...
- Give us a kiss. Come on.

372
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:29,305
Why? Why on the lips?
