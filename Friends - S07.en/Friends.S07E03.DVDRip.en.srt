00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,805  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,650  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
So, what do you think?

3
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:12,002  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:450 Y2:524
- About what?
- What?

4
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:16,443  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
Are you kidding?
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

5
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:19,929  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:484 Y2:524
Eyes.

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:21,930  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, no. Your eyes! No.

7
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,771  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
Chandler's eyes!

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:26,571  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:524
I got glasses.

9
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,048  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
You always had glasses.

10
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:33,292  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, I didn't.

11
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:35,966  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you sure?

12
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:38,852  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:524
Didn't you have a pair?

13
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:43,092  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
They were really round and burgundy,
and they made you look kind of... .

14
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,210  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Feminine.
- Yes!

15
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:46,562  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

16
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:49,446  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
I think the glasses look great.
You look sexy.

17
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:51,092  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Really?
- Yeah.

18
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,329  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
You didn't think I wore glasses?

19
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,046  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
Of course.

20
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,883  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
The One With Phoebe's Cookies

00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:02,042  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:450 Y2:524
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

22
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:51,129  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:052 Y2:131
What do you want for
an engagement gift?

23
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:53,329  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:052 Y2:132
That's okay, we're not
having a party...

24
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,404  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:052 Y2:094
...so you don't have to get us...

25
00:01:56,293 --> 00:02:00,206  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:052 Y2:131
If someone wants to give us a present,
we can't deprive them of that joy.

26
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:03,562  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:052 Y2:131
You should get them a
little CD player.

27
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:04,967  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:052 Y2:093
I already have one.

28
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:08,290  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:052 Y2:131
Unless someone borrowed it and
left it at the gynecologist.

29
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:14,683  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:052 Y2:132
Yeah, and by "someone"
she means Joey.

30
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,281  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:052 Y2:088
I know what I want!

31
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,206  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What we want, honey.
- No, you don't want this.

32
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:23,733  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:052 Y2:132
I want your grandmother's
cookie recipe.

33
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,163  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:052 Y2:131
You mean the chocolate chip
cookie recipe?

34
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,608  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:052 Y2:126
The one my grandma
made me swear on her deathbed...

35
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:32,413  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:052 Y2:131
...that I would never
let out of our family?

36
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:36,085  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
Dying people say the craziest things.

37
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:40,804  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:052 Y2:132
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna
make cookies for my children.

38
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:44,327  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
Break my heart. Oh, all right.

39
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:47,929  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:052 Y2:132
I'll be the mom who makes the
world's best chocolate chip cookies.

40
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:51,290  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
Our kids are gonna be fat,
aren't they?

41
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,652  X1:305 X2:410 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ahoy!

42
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,413  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
- How's the boat?
- I'm getting into this sailing stuff.

43
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,450  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
You finally took it out of the marina?

44
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,412  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why would I do that?

45
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,846  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
It took three guys
to get the thing in there.

46
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:07,649  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:524
If you don't sail it,
what do you do on it?

47
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,571  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's a great place to just sit...

48
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:13,123  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
...hang around, drink a few beers,
eat some chips.

49
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:17,730  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's good that you finally
have a place to do that.

50
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:20,688  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
I could teach you to sail if you want.

51
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:23,088  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You could?
- I've been sailing my whole life.

52
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,245  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
When I was 15, my dad
bought me my own boat.

53
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:29,729  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Your own boat?
- He was trying to cheer me up.

54
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,525  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:524
My pony was sick.

55
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,683  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You know what I was thinking?
- What?

56
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,124  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:524
Nothing, I just like to go like this.

57
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:51,248  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What are you doing tonight?
- Do you have a lecture?

58
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:54,530  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No, why?
- Then, free as a bird. What's up?

59
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:57,452  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
My dad wants to know if you want
to play racquetball.

60
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,325  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:524
Great! Dad must like you!

61
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,171  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
He doesn't ask just anyone to play.

62
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,523  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
He didn't ask for you.
He asked for "Chauncey. "

63
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,928  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
I assumed he meant you.

64
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:07,932  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you correct him?

65
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,607  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, I thought it would be
more fun this way.

66
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:14,322  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:446 Y2:524
Cool! Maybe you could
do this every week.

67
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,767  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
Or you could sit on the porch...

68
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:18,049  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and make sure no one
steals the trashcans.

69
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,683  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:524
He does that every week too.

70
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:25,648  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
Just so you know, you have to let
him win. He hates to lose.

71
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,168  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:524
Maybe I'll play with my left hand.

72
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:30,567  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're not a lefty?

73
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,571  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
Does anybody know me?

74
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,363  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's wrong?

75
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,844  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:446 Y2:524
I went to my old apartment
to get the cookie recipe...

76
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:45,442  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and that stupid fire burned it up!

77
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:49,328  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
No! Why didn't you make a copy
and keep it in a fireproof box...

78
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,451  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and keep it at least 100 yards
away from the original?

79
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,407  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:524
Because I'm normal.

80
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,567  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
That was the one legacy
my grandmother left me.

81
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:07,486  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I know you wanted it
as an engagement present.

82
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:09,763  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
We have to get you
an engagement present?

83
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:11,887  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't worry about it.

84
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:14,527  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:484 Y2:524
No one got me an engagement present.

85
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:18,523  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't have the recipe, but here.

86
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:21,082  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wish you health
and happiness.

87
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:23,731  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:488 Y2:524
An old cookie?

88
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:27,328  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is what happens when you
don't register for gifts.

89
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:33,089  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:446 Y2:524
I made a batch and froze it.
This is the only one left.

90
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,487  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:524
We can't accept this.

91
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:35,648  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why not?

92
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,529  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:524
Cause it's gross.

93
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,330  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, wait. I think I can figure out
the recipe from this cookie.

94
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,171  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:488 Y2:524
I do this at work all the time.

95
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,482  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Really?
- I think so!

96
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:52,045  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.

97
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,528  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:524
Two! I've been engaged twice.

98
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:04,562  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look at this clown.

99
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,930  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:524
He thinks he can take up the
whole river.

100
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,733  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
Get out of the way, jackass!

101
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,973  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:524
Who names their boat
<i>Coast Guard, </i> anyway?

102
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,211  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:488 Y2:524
That is the Coast Guard.

103
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,448  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are they doing here?

104
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,763  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
The coast is all the way over there.

105
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:25,046  X1:162 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey, just ignore the boats.

106
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,403  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:524
- We're not finished with our lesson.
- All right.

107
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:29,729  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm gonna go over the basic
points once more.

108
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,850  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:524
Come on, Rach. I got it, okay?

109
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,731  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
I want to go over there...

110
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,128  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
...where that boatload of girls is.

111
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:40,009  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is that it? You want to give...

112
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,124  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:524
...a shout to the hot <i>chicas</i>?

113
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,244  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.

114
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:47,485  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
Quick question, though:
What's this called?

115
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,770  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Boat rope?
- Wrong!

116
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:53,725  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
How do you get the mainsail up?

117
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,530  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
Rub it?

118
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:02,923  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:524
No. What do you do if I say
we're coming about?

119
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,926  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
I say, "Come again?"

120
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,051  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know this one. I know this one.

121
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:11,925  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
Time's up. Now you're dead.

122
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,322  X1:279 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:524
And deaf!

123
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,410  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:484 Y2:524
You go on and make your little jokes.

124
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:17,046  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:444 Y2:524
If you don't know
what you're doing...

125
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:20,410  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
...you will die.
Am I getting through to you?

126
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,371  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Yes.
- Don't just say yes.

127
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,962  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:524
This isn't a game.
You could get hurt out here!

128
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,886  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you want to pay attention,
or do you want to die?

129
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:34,732  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
I want to make a
ship-to-shore call to Chandler.

130
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,486  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I definitely taste nutmeg.
- You do?

131
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:49,048  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:524
You don't? Well, that's
the difference...

132
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:51,323  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
...between a
professional and a layman.

133
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,571  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
That and arrogance.

134
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:57,642  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

135
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,332  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey. How was sailing?

136
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,924  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't want to talk about it.

137
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:04,723  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:524
You could've at least saved
me a cookie.

138
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,526  X1:225 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:524
Women are mean!

139
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,242  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe that.

140
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:19,684  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
Now the only thing left
of my grandmother's legacy is...

141
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,372  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
...this crumb.

142
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,966  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:484 Y2:524
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

143
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,651  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey.
- How was it?

144
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:33,321  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, I had a great time.

145
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,803  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
Chauncey on the other hand... .

146
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:37,924  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
I will tell the story.

147
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:41,131  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was going great.
I let him win, we were bonding...

148
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:43,125  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:524
...he even said I could call him Dad.

149
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,045  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
And what did he ask you
not to call him?

150
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,362  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Daddy. "

151
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,370  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, here's the story.

152
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:55,525  X1:120 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>We had just finished playing, </i>
<i>and we were gonna take a steam. </i>

153
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:56,762  X1:196 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:524
<i>I walk into the room... </i>

154
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:58,929  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:524
<i>... and it's really steamy. </i>

155
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:04,450  X1:150 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>So I take off my glasses, </i>
<i>and that's when it happened. </i>

156
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:05,642  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:524
Guys?

157
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,646  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Over here.
- Have a seat, son.

158
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:14,643  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey!

159
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:27,566  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, my God! I can't believe it.
- I know.

160
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:30,128  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
You gave my father a lap dance.

161
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:35,847  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
Why do they put
so much steam in there?

162
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,884  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:524
Because otherwise they'd
have to call it the "room" room.

163
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,246  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
Why?
Why did that have to happen?

164
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,571  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:524
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

165
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:52,048  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
Not that big a deal?

166
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:54,568  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
There was touching of things.

167
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:56,843  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
I know you wanted
to bond with my dad...

168
00:09:57,053 --> 00:10:00,090  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but did you have to bond
to that part?

169
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,891  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm sure Dad doesn't care.

170
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,566  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:524
He probably thought it was funny.

171
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,485  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
He'll be telling this story for years.

172
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:11,366  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want him to tell
this story for years.

173
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,848  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, but he will.

174
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:18,566  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
He still tells the story about how
Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

175
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,402  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:524
I wasn't escaping.

176
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,763  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
Then how'd you get caught
in the barbed wire?

177
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:26,531  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was trying to help out a squirrel.

178
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,451  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
You were trying to eat it.

179
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,372  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
If that is your father calling
to tell this story...

180
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,245  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:524
...then the marriage is off!

181
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,724  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:524
Come on. Hello.

182
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:41,643  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

183
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,724  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'll call you later, Dad.
I love you.

184
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,652  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm off to see your dad.

185
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:53,806  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aren't you a little overdressed?

186
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:59,049  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:446 Y2:524
You better make sure
he tips you this time.

187
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,244  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
I figured I would try to convince
him not to tell the story anymore...

188
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:06,246  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and I figured the best way
to do that was face to face.

189
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,882  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:524
And by "face," I don't mean his lap.

190
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,852  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:524
And by "face," I don't mean my ass.

191
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:17,206  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
Are you getting Monica and
Chandler a present?

192
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:19,688  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know. You know,
they didn't get us anything.

193
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,451  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you!

194
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:24,448  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

195
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,127  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, hello.

196
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,086  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
So when are we getting
back out on the water, matey?

197
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:33,330  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know the boat way
to say this, but, never.

198
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:36,162  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why not?

199
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:38,648  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
Because you're mean on the boat.

200
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,005  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was just trying to teach you.

201
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:43,522  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, lesson learned.
Rachel is mean.

202
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,445  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yep, yep, yep.

203
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,569  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
I remember when she took me out
on her dad's boat.

204
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:52,610  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
She wouldn't let me help at all.

205
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,690  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Excuse me, I wanted you to help.

206
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,048  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:524
But you couldn't move...

207
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:59,126  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:524
...because you were wearing
three life jackets.

208
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,052  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:524
You have to respect the sea.

209
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,093  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:450 Y2:524
Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
that was mean.

210
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,289  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
But I tell you, that was not mean.

211
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:13,242  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:446 Y2:524
My father is mean. He used to always
yell at me on the boat.

212
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:16,451  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was horrible.
I was being a really good teacher.

213
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,406  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
Does a good teacher say,
"Put down the beer, pinhead! "

214
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:23,489  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:446 Y2:524
Does a good student drink 7 beers
during his first lesson?

215
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:25,162  X1:248 X2:466 Y1:488 Y2:524
Six and a half.

216
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:27,570  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
You knocked the last
one out of my hand, remember?

217
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,604  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:524
I didn't want you to get hit
by the boom.

218
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,087  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, it hit me anyway.

219
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,370  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
It would have hurt a lot less
if I had finished that last beer.

220
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:40,248  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down
and stop yelling.

221
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,252  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
No bossing me around?

222
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:44,165  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I won't boss you around.
- And be nice?

223
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:45,965  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'll be nice.
- You'll be topless?

224
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,402  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Joey!
- You want me to learn?

225
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,442  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:524
Here's batch 22.
Maybe these are like your grandma's.

226
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,446  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
This has a bit of orange peel,
but no nutmeg.

227
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,251  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let's give it a shot.

228
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,082  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
I haven't made so many cookies
since 9th grade.

229
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,806  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:486 Y2:524
What for, a bake sale?

230
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:09,844  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, just a Friday night.

231
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:16,521  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
These are pretty good.

232
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,564  X1:110 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.

233
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:19,762  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:524
Which one was that?

234
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,009  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:446 Y2:524
The ones we had after
you almost threw up.

235
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,049  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.

236
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:28,251  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:524
I did not like batch 16.

237
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,251  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm okay.

238
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:35,524  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:524
Any more from the good batch?
We could work off those.

239
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:39,043  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:524
I think there's one left.

240
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:46,649  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
Batch 16.
Sixteen, people, get out of the way!

241
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:57,442  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, Joey. You're doing really good.

242
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,723  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just need you
to step to the portside.

243
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:07,242  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
Remember talking about the portside?

244
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:08,932  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah.

245
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,248  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

246
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:15,408  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.
That's a tough one.

247
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:16,966  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why not just say left?

248
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,845  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, go to the left.

249
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,932  X1:288 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
The left.

250
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,122  X1:218 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:524
Just sit over there!

251
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,403  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're yelling again. See that?

252
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:32,401  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, no, no. Very quiet.
Said with love, no yelling.

253
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,569  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524
You know what?

254
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:39,249  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
Since I'm here, I'm gonna have
a beer on the portside.

255
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,125  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:524
See what I did there?

256
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:48,611  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're luffing a little.
Can you tighten up the Cunningham?

257
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:52,728  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:524
You just said a bunch
of stuff I don't know.

258
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,527  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joey, come on!
We just went over this.

259
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:57,604  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:488 Y2:524
We did that when that bird...

260
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,809  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:524
...flew over with the fish
in his mouth.

261
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,645  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you see it? It was gross.

262
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:03,844  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:524
I did not see the bird or the fish!

263
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:07,005  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
I did not see the piece of
Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!

264
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:12,249  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:524
I did not, because I was trying
to teach you how to sail a boat.

265
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:15,166  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which obviously is
an impossible thing to do.

266
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,331  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're yelling, and I don't
see you taking your top off.

267
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,006  X1:306 X2:410 Y1:484 Y2:524
I quit!

268
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:23,885  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What do you mean? You can't quit.
- Why not?

269
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:26,891  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're not finished! I won't have it.
Greenes do not quit.

270
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,405  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:524
Greenes?

271
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:32,605  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit.

272
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:36,922  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

273
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:40,006  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
I just said, "Greenes don't quit,"
didn't I?

274
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,441  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
Did I say, "Greenes don't quit"?

275
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,565  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes! And you're still yelling at me.

276
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:47,606  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, I'm not yelling at you.
I'm just yelling near you.

277
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,610  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, God, Joey. I'm my father.

278
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,413  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God. This is horrible.

279
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:57,202  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524
I try so hard not to be my mother,
I didn't see this coming.

280
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:04,611  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to learn.

281
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:10,612  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:524
I did learn.

282
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:14,089  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.

283
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:15,772  X1:283 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's okay.

284
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:17,804  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know what a mainsail is.

285
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:22,207  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
I know to duck when
the boom comes across.

286
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:25,372  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I know port is right.
- Left.

287
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:26,801  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
Damn it!

288
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,288  X1:083 X2:633 Y1:484 Y2:524
It would make my grandmother happy...

289
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,291  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:524
...that we're trying
to figure out her recipe.

290
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:39,811  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
I bet she's looking up at us
and smiling right now.

291
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,085  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:524
Looking up?

292
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,730  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
She was really nice to me but
she's in hell for sure.

293
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:50,562  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I've tried everything.

294
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,451  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
I give up.
I'm not gonna be the mom...

295
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,285  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:524
...who makes the world's
best cookies.

296
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:59,483  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:524
I do make the best
duck confit with broccoli raab.

297
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:00,848  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
Kids love that, right?

298
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,291  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
Isn't there any relative
that has the recipe?

299
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:07,932  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
What about your sister?

300
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,852  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
No. I made a promise to
myself that the next time...

301
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:14,045  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
...I would talk to Ursula
is over my dead body.

302
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:19,850  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:524
And that's not happening
till October 15, 2032.

303
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:22,243  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's the day you're gonna die?

304
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:24,484  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've got shuffleboard that day.

305
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:26,968  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's what you think.

306
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:32,886  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
What about friends of your grandma?

307
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,202  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
Wouldn't they have the recipe?

308
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:38,326  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
I may have relatives in France
who would know.

309
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:43,402  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
My grandmother said she got it from
her grandmother, "Nestley Toulouse. "

310
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:46,169  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:488 Y2:524
What was her name?

311
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:49,453  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
Nestley Toulouse.

312
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,443  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:524
Nestlé Tollhouse?

313
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:01,053  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
You Americans always butcher
the French language.

314
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:05,322  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe, is this the recipe?

315
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,052  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes!

316
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:13,168  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

317
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,451  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
I cannot believe that I spent...

318
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,689  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
...two days figuring out that recipe.

319
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,286  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:524
It was here the whole time!

320
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:23,247  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:450 Y2:524
I know! You see,
it is stuff like this...

321
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,848  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:446 Y2:524
...which is why
you're burning in hell!

322
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:30,963  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
<i>So you understand. </i>

323
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:33,641  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'd feel better if you
didn't tell what happened.

324
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:36,572  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm a little embarrassed about it.

325
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,644  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
I understand completely.

326
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,282  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
Nothing's scarier
than embarrassing yourself...

327
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,443  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
...in front of your in-laws.

328
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:46,732  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
As a matter of fact, when I started
dating Judy, I was unemployed.

329
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,128  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
Her father asked me
what I did for a living.

330
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,051  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
I said I was a lawyer.

331
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:53,603  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What'd you do when they found out?
- They never did.

332
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:57,442  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524
So if you ever see me giving them
legal advice, just nod along.

333
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,047  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:524
Shall we?

334
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,252  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:484 Y2:524
So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.

335
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:31,930  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, Joey, I hate to admit it...

336
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,567  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:450 Y2:524
...your way of sailing
is a lot more fun.

337
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,165  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't you give a pull
on that rope?

338
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,448  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're not sailing.

339
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:44,730  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Just pull on it.
- All right.

340
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,926  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:052 Y2:088
Sandwiches!

341
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,646  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:052 Y2:088
What else?

342
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,086  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:052 Y2:093
Here you go.

343
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:57,364  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:052 Y2:128
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

344
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,651  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:052 Y2:131
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

345
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:06,044  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:052 Y2:132
Not like that. You're letting
all the good stuff fall out.

346
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:10,042  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:052 Y2:131
Careful!
You're wasting good pastrami!

347
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,407  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:094
Oh, my God. I'm my dad!
