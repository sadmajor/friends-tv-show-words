1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,253
- Hi.
- Hi! Hi, Ben.

2
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:07,626
- Hi.
- We have a bathroom emergency.

3
00:00:07,927 --> 00:00:09,087
Go ahead.

4
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:14,527
Before we do, are any of Joey's
special "romance" magazines in there?

5
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:19,368
- No.
- Okay, all clear.

6
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,306
Thanks, Phoebe.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:24,908
That's Rachel.

8
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:27,074
But whatever.

9
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:31,909
- Everything okay in there?
- Don't talk to me now.

10
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:34,820
Just like his daddy.

11
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:37,781
Could you do me a big favor?

12
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:40,389
I have a meeting
at the dean's office.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,594
Can you watch Ben for an hour?

14
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:46,263
- What about Monica?
- She isn't home.

15
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:50,297
So it would just be me alone?

16
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:53,000
Ben would be there.

17
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:57,673
What's the matter?

18
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:01,746
I've never done that before.
Me and him, alone.

19
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:03,544
He's not an ex-con.

20
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:05,844
Okay, okay...

21
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:08,882
- What do I do with him?
- I don't know, talk to him.

22
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:10,919
Entertain him. Keep him alive.

23
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:15,152
- Okay.
- Ben, come here.

24
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:19,261
I'm gonna leave you here with
Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?

25
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:20,397
Gonna be okay?

26
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,598
- I think so.
- I wasn't talking to you.

27
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:27,467
- I'll be okay.
- Okay. I'll see you soon, buddy.

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,108
- Be back in an hour.
- Bye Dad.

29
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:38,682
- So this is fun, huh?
- Not really.

30
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:45,522
- Okay. Want something to drink?
- Okay.

31
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:48,159
Great. All right,
how do you feel about Diet Coke?

32
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:50,862
- I'm not allowed to have soda.
- Okay.

33
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:53,622
Well, that's pretty much all
that we have.

34
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,666
Have you ever had a virgin margarita?

35
00:01:57,303 --> 00:01:58,964
What's a virgin?

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,303
Water it is.

37
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:07,937
The One With The
Truth About London

38
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:45,613
What about the second minister?
I kind of liked him.

39
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:49,719
- You mean the spitter?
- Come on. He wasn't that bad.

40
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:52,514
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veil.

41
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:56,960
- And the third guy?
- He kept staring at your chest.

42
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:58,894
Can you blame him?

43
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:02,666
I don't like the idea of
me saying, "I do"...

44
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:04,835
...while he's thinking,
"I'd do it too."

45
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:09,806
- Well, then we still have a problem.
- With what?

46
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:14,412
We need someone to perform our wedding
but they're all boring or annoying...

47
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:16,511
...or keep staring at the ladies.

48
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,784
You should have one of us do it.

49
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:24,956
We're getting "married" married,
not "6th-grade" married.

50
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:27,416
No, it's a real thing.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,059
Anyone can be ordained on the Internet
and perform weddings and stuff.

52
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:34,664
- Are you serious? - A friend
of mine did it. It's totally legal.

53
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,266
I call it!

54
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,134
What? It was my idea!

55
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:42,467
Thank you very much, but neither
of you is marrying us.

56
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:45,471
Does calling it not mean
anything anymore?

57
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:48,278
We're having a legitimate
clergy member.

58
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:50,982
And when I say legitimate,
I mean gay...

59
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:53,548
...and in control of his saliva.

60
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:58,490
- Is that lemon poppy seed?
- You don't want these. They're stale.

61
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:01,785
- I'm leaving them outside for the pigeons.
- I call them!

62
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:16,704
Ben, you know, when you were a baby...

63
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:19,104
...we'd hang out all the time.

64
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,040
I was your daddy's girlfriend.

65
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:23,372
But you're not anymore.

66
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:28,084
- No, I'm not.
- Because you guys were on a break...

67
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:30,322
Hey, we were not on a...

68
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,115
That's fine.
You know what Ben?

69
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:38,195
One day when you are a lot older,
I'm gonna tell you that entire story...

70
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:41,526
...over a real pitcher
of margaritas. Okay?

71
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:47,300
- When's my daddy coming back?
- Fifty-two minutes.

72
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:53,645
So no brothers or sisters, huh?

73
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:56,337
That must be nice.
You don't have to share stuff.

74
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:57,948
Sharing is good.

75
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:02,710
You're one of those.

76
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:07,158
You know what, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,955
- Really? Like how?
- Well, you know, we would...

78
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,562
...we'd repeat everything
the other said...

79
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,269
...or we'd jump out of closets
to scare each other...

80
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:20,938
...or switch the sugar with salt
so they put salt on their cereal.

81
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,465
That's a good one.

82
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:26,845
- Yeah, you like that one?
- Yeah, you're funny.

83
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:28,407
I'm funny?

84
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:29,873
Oh, thank God.

85
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:32,609
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.

86
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:35,483
You want a good one?
Here's a good one.

87
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:38,022
You take a quarter...

88
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:43,058
...and you blacken the edge, right?

89
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:46,763
And then you say,
"I bet you can't roll this quarter...

90
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,163
...to your chin without it
leaving your face."

91
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:54,339
And when they do it, they're left with
a line down the center of their face.

92
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,436
Can I do it to you?

93
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,210
I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

94
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,018
So did you find anyone
to marry you yet?

95
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:14,488
No, but "Horny for Monica" minister
called...

96
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:17,026
...wondering if we're still together.

97
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:20,597
- We'll never find anybody.
- Then let me do it.

98
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,266
- Joey...
- I've been thinking.

99
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:25,266
I'm an actor, so I won't
get nervous in front of people.

100
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:27,336
- Joey, please...
- No, no, no.

101
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,839
I won't spit and I won't stare
at Monica's breasts.

102
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,271
Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

103
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:37,882
- That's true.
- The most important thing...

104
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,517
...is, it won't be some stranger
who barely knows you.

105
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:45,212
It'll be me. And I swear,
I'll do a really good job.

106
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,689
Plus, I love you guys and it
would really mean a lot to me.

107
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:53,857
- Well, we haven't found anybody else.
- Might be kind of cool.

108
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:56,091
- So I can do it?
- Yeah, you can do it.

109
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,530
All right! Okay!

110
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:01,568
Okay, I gotta get started
on my speech.

111
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:03,068
Wait a minute.

112
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:06,144
Internet ministers
can have sex, right?

113
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,614
- Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?
- I have a headache. A horrible headache.

114
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:19,951
- I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
- Oh, my God, you've got to stop chattering.

115
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:23,589
Here, take a couple of these.

116
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:25,955
- What is it?
- It's Hexedrin.

117
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,258
Oh, no,
I don't believe in Western medicine.

118
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:32,631
If you just apply pressure
to these points right here...

119
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:36,371
Then your hands starts to hurt and
you still have a headache, so thanks.

120
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:42,277
While we're waiting for these pills to kick
in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch.

121
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:45,313
Come on. Get some nice soft pillows
under your head.

122
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:48,281
I'm gonna turn the TV on.
You can watch whatever you want.

123
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:53,686
Sit down. I'm gonna make you some tea,
and then I'm gonna rub your feet.

124
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:56,655
My head!

125
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:05,395
Coming.

126
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:15,973
I have a bone to pick with you.

127
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:19,708
- Uh-oh.
- Yes.

128
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:22,216
Ben learned a little trick.

129
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:27,988
- Oh, did he pull the old...?
- That's right. That's right.

130
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:32,022
Saran wrap on the toilet seat...

131
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:34,994
...so the pee goes everywhere.

132
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:38,894
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

133
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,398
You know I hate practical jokes.

134
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:45,404
They're mean, they're stupid and
I don't want my son learning them.

135
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:49,807
Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
Isn't that just a little funny?

136
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,606
- I was barefoot.
- Oh.

137
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:55,043
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

138
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:57,712
You're not laughing with someone,
you're laughing at them.

139
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,891
And laughing at someone is not nice.

140
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,953
So you're one of those too.

141
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:07,663
Tell me, the toilet thing is the
only thing you taught him, right?

142
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:12,571
Yes.

143
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:18,310
It' amazing.
My headache is completely gone.

144
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:21,707
- What were those pills called?
- Hexedrin.

145
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:23,848
I love you Hexedrin.

146
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:27,711
Oh, look, it comes with a story.

147
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,712
Phoebe, those are like
the side effects and stuff.

148
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:33,118
Say what?

149
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:35,122
You know, the possible side effects.

150
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,227
Oh, my God.

151
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:41,399
"Dizziness. Nervousness. Drowsiness.

152
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,161
Facial swelling. Nausea. Headache..."

153
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,032
Headache.

154
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:52,602
"Vomiting. Stomach bleeding.
Liver damage."

155
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:57,112
I don't recall any of these coming up when
you gave me these little death capsules.

156
00:09:57,983 --> 00:10:01,680
Oh, I'm sorry.
"Extra strength" death capsules.

157
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:05,186
None of that ever happens. They
just put it on there for legal reasons.

158
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,052
Why?

159
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,822
In case it happens.

160
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,391
- Hey.
- Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

161
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,626
- You got ordained?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:20,169
Just got off the Internet.
Man, there's a lot of porn out there.

163
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:23,605
Our minister.

164
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:27,072
I can now officially marry
anybody I want.

165
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,238
Hey, you guys seem happy. If you ever
want to get marry, you give me a call.

166
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,714
If not, you give me a call.

167
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:39,487
I have liver damage.

168
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,227
Phoebe, your liver is right here.

169
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:47,532
Okay, well, then I must be disoriented.

170
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:53,234
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

171
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:56,498
Listen, this is just
the first draft, so...

172
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,502
"We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion...

173
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:04,476
...to celebrate the special love
that Monica and Chandler share.

174
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:10,322
It is a love based on
giving and receiving...

175
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:13,023
...as well as having and sharing.

176
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:18,059
And the love that they give
and have is shared and received.

177
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:22,694
And through this having and giving...

178
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:25,630
...and sharing and receiving...

179
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,471
...we too can share and love
and have...

180
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:35,909
...and receive."

181
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:40,716
Should we call the spitter?

182
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:53,464
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

183
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,063
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

184
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:59,100
I was just in the neighborhood...

185
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:02,704
...and I passed by your building and
thought, "What's up with Carol...

186
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:04,703
...and sweet little Ben?"

187
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:08,211
- That's nice. Well, come on in.
- Okay.

188
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,573
I'll make some coffee
and we can chat.

189
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:12,512
I'd love that.
I would love that.

190
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:17,049
So where is sweet little Ben?

191
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:19,324
I would love to have a little...

192
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:24,252
I found him!

193
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:27,094
Very funny. Come here.

194
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,897
That is exactly why I've
come here to talk to you, okay?

195
00:12:31,237 --> 00:12:33,535
- Rachel, you want sugar?
- Yes, but...

196
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,636
Do I want sugar in my coffee?

197
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:41,640
No, just some milk would
be good, Carol. Thanks.

198
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:44,677
Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?

199
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,750
"Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?"

200
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:50,212
- Don't do that.
- "Don't do that."

201
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:54,186
- Your dad doesn't like pranks.
- "Your dad doesn't like pranks."

202
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,625
- Oh, damn it!
- "Oh, damn it!"

203
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,329
No! Don't say that.

204
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:00,554
- Damn it!
- Go back to repeating.

205
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,265
- Damn it!
- Oh, crap!

206
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:03,557
"Oh, crap!"

207
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,132
I feel like my face is swelling.
Is my face swelling?

208
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:14,369
Phoebe, your face is fine. None of
this stuff is gonna happen to you.

209
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,208
- Stop being a baby.
- Interesting you should call me that...

210
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,850
...now that I may never have one.

211
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:23,878
Okay, I got some more written, ready?

212
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:25,818
Yeah, okay.

213
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:30,658
"When I think of the love that these
two givers and receivers share...

214
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,862
...I can't help but envy the lifetime
ahead of having and loving...

215
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:39,994
...and giving..." And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.

216
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:42,934
- How about "receiving"?
- Yes!

217
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:48,275
See, Joe, not that that's not great...

218
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:52,977
...but one cool thing about having
a friend perform the ceremony...

219
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:54,809
...is that it can be about us.

220
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,419
It can be more personal.
You can tell stories about us.

221
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,986
Like the time you
and I went to Atlantic City...

222
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:06,129
...and I made you laugh so hard
you threw up your whole steak?

223
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:08,097
No.

224
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,635
Not us.

225
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:13,364
Us.

226
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:16,172
I got you. Sorry.

227
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,105
So did you ever make him throw up
a whole anything?

228
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:24,377
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule
that made him bleed from the eyes?

229
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:27,619
It doesn't say that.

230
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:31,220
Suddenly somebody knows all
about the side effects.

231
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:37,762
Joey, we want you to tell stories,
but romantic stories, nice stories.

232
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,893
Okay! Maybe I'll talk about London,
when you hooked up.

233
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:45,568
Only I won't say "hooked up"...

234
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:48,932
...I'll say, "began their
beautiful journey...

235
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:51,473
- There you go.
...by doing it."

236
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:56,278
- Joe.
- Okay, all right.

237
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:00,077
So how did it happen?
Did your eyes meet across the room...

238
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:03,822
...then you're in the bathtub
and she's feeding you strawberries?

239
00:15:05,424 --> 00:15:08,325
- Isn't that what happened to you?
- Yeah!

240
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:12,957
I call that "London style."

241
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:15,823
That didn't happen with us.

242
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:19,627
Maybe you should say it is,
because "London style" sounds nice.

243
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,698
Okay, uh...

244
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:27,408
I was sad that night because
this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

245
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:32,078
And Chandler was really sweet
and he consoled me and...

246
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:34,909
...we drank too much.
- Yeah, baby.

247
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:41,684
I was a gentleman and I walked her to
her hotel room and said good night.

248
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:46,759
- But then, later that night...
- Yeah, baby.

249
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:16,726
Cute P.J.s. Really living it up
here in London, huh?

250
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:21,928
Well, I wasn't exactly
expecting company after...

251
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,362
...9:15.

252
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:26,430
Is Joey here?

253
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:30,903
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.

254
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:35,240
You're not still upset about
what that guy told you, are you?

255
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:37,543
Wouldn't you be?

256
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:41,749
It's been a really emotional time
and you've had a lot to drink...

257
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,578
You have to let that go, okay?

258
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:46,755
You were the most beautiful
woman in the room tonight.

259
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:48,690
Really?

260
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:52,328
You kidding? You're the most
beautiful woman in most rooms...

261
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:01,070
Whoa, what's going on?

262
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:02,238
We just made out.

263
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:04,601
- We're making out?
- Not anymore.

264
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:09,038
- But we don't do that.
- I know, I thought it would be fun.

265
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,247
How drunk are you?

266
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:16,318
Enough to know I want to do this. Not
so much that you should feel guilty.

267
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,217
That's the perfect amount.

268
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:27,823
- You know what's weird?
- What?

269
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:30,328
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

270
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:34,663
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

271
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:39,341
Want to get under the covers?
Okay.

272
00:17:48,754 --> 00:17:50,187
Wow, you are really fast!

273
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:53,458
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

274
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,324
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

275
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:00,563
- At the same time?
- Count of three?

276
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:03,494
One, two, three.

277
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:11,770
Well, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectively ruined.

278
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,875
Eh, we weren't that close anyway.

279
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:17,943
Joey, Joey, Joey...!

280
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:22,852
Hey.

281
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:25,351
Hey, Joe.
I was just watching a movie...

282
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:31,485
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

283
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:33,896
No!

284
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,697
It's cool, I'm still
with my bridesmaid.

285
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:38,402
Where are the condoms?

286
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:40,401
In my bag over there.

287
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,576
Could you leave me one?

288
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:53,551
For just you?

289
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,211
Yeah.

290
00:18:58,257 --> 00:19:01,852
Why don't you come downstairs with me.
There's some really nice girls down there.

291
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:04,018
No, I'm fine.

292
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:06,588
All right. There you go, buddy.

293
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:08,026
Go nuts.

294
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:12,667
That's what that was?

295
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:16,840
Because that other thing, I thought you were
onto something. But it did nothing for me.

296
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:20,403
Can we change the topic?
Because it's really doing nothing for me.

297
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:26,082
If I hadn't left you one, you two
might've never gotten together.

298
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:29,883
Imagine if I had sent that hooker
like I was gonna?

299
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:34,189
It's like it was in the stars.

300
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,025
Yeah, totally meant to be.

301
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:39,627
Tell him who you originally
wanted to hook up with that night.

302
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:42,229
- What?
- What?

303
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:43,893
What?

304
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:48,495
Who did you originally
want to hook up with?

305
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:52,139
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.

306
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:56,370
I was really depressed, okay?
And really drunk.

307
00:19:56,715 --> 00:20:00,947
I wanted something stupid and
meaningless. I just wanted sex.

308
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:04,216
So, when I went to your
room that night...

309
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:07,551
...I was actually looking for Joey.

310
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,461
Yeah, baby.

311
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:18,960
No, baby.

312
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:21,532
Oh, my God.

313
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,535
You came looking for Joey?

314
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,870
- Were you planning on telling me this?
- No, I didn't think it was important.

315
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,748
It's not important?
It's not important?

316
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:33,779
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him not me.

317
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:37,148
No. The point is,
it was you that was there that night.

318
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:40,985
It is you that I'm marrying.
It is you that I fell in love with.

319
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:46,688
And it is a love that is based
on having and giving and receiv...

320
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:51,027
Weird. The most romantic night
of my life and I'm runner-up.

321
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:55,467
Do you know how unbelievably
glad I am that Joey wasn't there?

322
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:57,174
Hey!

323
00:20:58,443 --> 00:21:01,173
I'm a man of the cloth,
but I still have feelings.

324
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:06,173
There's no way you're
doing this wedding now, okay?

325
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:09,854
What? That's not fair.
It's not my fault.

326
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:11,587
I was with my bridesmaid.

327
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:13,791
And who's to say
I would've said yes?

328
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:16,050
I mean, I would've said yes.

329
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:20,193
You are making way too
big a deal out of this.

330
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:21,956
Everything worked out okay.

331
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:23,496
It's just weird, okay?

332
00:21:23,802 --> 00:21:27,738
I don't want to be saying my vows with
the mental image of you and Monica.

333
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,735
I need... I don't know what I need.
I need a walk.

334
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:34,376
- Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
- It is to me.

335
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:37,774
You wanted to sleep with Batman
and settled for Robin.

336
00:21:42,154 --> 00:21:45,180
- This is crazy.
- No, Robin is so gay.

337
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,329
Phoebe, what were you thinking?
How could you tell him that?

338
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,964
I don't know.
I'm sorry, it just came out.

339
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,259
It's a side effect.

340
00:21:58,503 --> 00:22:01,336
- So now what have we agreed?
- No more pranks.

341
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,009
- What else?
- You and Daddy were not on a break.

342
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,299
Very good.

343
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:12,510
Rachel, what are you doing here?

344
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:15,780
I'm just visiting
my good friend Carol.

345
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:18,516
- Your good friend?
- Yeah.

346
00:22:19,124 --> 00:22:20,386
What's her last name?

347
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:24,122
Carol...

348
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,320
...Lesbian.
- Nice.

349
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:33,268
- By the way, that line down my face...
- What line?

350
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,339
"What Line?"
The line that prompted a student...

351
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:39,874
...in my last class of the day to say:

352
00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:42,045
"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"

353
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:45,880
All right I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

354
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:48,712
- But you were so mad already.
- Of course I was mad.

355
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,412
I told you I hate this stuff. Okay?
It's not funny.

356
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:53,817
- Hey, Ross.
- Hi.

357
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:55,492
- What's not funny?
- Practical jokes.

358
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:57,628
Well, I think they're funny.

359
00:22:57,996 --> 00:23:00,863
- You have a line down your face.
- What?

360
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:07,471
- Okay, maybe they're not funny to you...
- Oh, my God!

361
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:08,764
Or Carol.

362
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:12,440
But they're funny to kids.
And who is it hurting?

363
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:17,805
I'll tell you who it hurts. It hurts the kid
who has all his clothes stolen in gym class...

364
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,508
...so he has to go to the principal's office
wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt.

365
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,483
That was you?

366
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,315
We heard about you in junior high.

367
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:31,189
Did you really just shake your fist in
the air and shout, "I will be revenged!"

368
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:36,266
I will be!

369
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:41,204
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.

370
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,367
- Okay?
- Fine. Fine.

371
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:47,134
Once I taught him that stuff,
he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."

372
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:49,379
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.

373
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:53,550
But I'll go back to being boring
and uncomfortable Aunt Rachel.

374
00:23:55,687 --> 00:23:58,747
No, it's not what I want.

375
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:02,386
I'm glad you guys were bonding but...

376
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:04,618
Look, he doesn't have any siblings.

377
00:24:04,896 --> 00:24:07,057
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

378
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:10,892
I haven't taught him anything
a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.

379
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:13,067
- Crap!
- I gotta go.

380
00:24:21,713 --> 00:24:23,510
- Hey.
- Hey.

381
00:24:23,782 --> 00:24:29,482
You want this scone? It came for me
but it would rather sleep with you.

382
00:24:29,688 --> 00:24:31,155
Nothing even happened.

383
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:37,057
- Look, I know you want to do the wedding...
- No. If you don't want me to do it...

384
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:41,561
...I accept that. I don't care about that.
I just don't want you to be upset.

385
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,458
How can I not be upset?

386
00:24:43,802 --> 00:24:46,635
I finally fall in love
with this fantastic woman...

387
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:48,963
...and it turns out
she wanted you first.

388
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:52,072
Yeah, for like a half an hour
one night.

389
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:56,071
Chandler, she wants you
for the rest of her life.

390
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:58,248
You're so lucky.

391
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,383
Look what I missed out on
by not being there.

392
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:02,711
Although, you know what?

393
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:05,981
It could never have worked out
like you guys did.

394
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:08,716
Because you guys are perfect
for each other.

395
00:25:10,195 --> 00:25:14,256
We look at you and we
see you together, and it just...

396
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:18,067
...it fits, you know?

397
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:21,800
And you just know
it's gonna last forever.

398
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:26,473
That's what you should say.

399
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:28,906
What?

400
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:34,644
When you're marrying us,
that's what you should say.

401
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:37,483
Really? I could do it?

402
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:39,885
I'd love you to do it.

403
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,090
Hey.

404
00:25:44,996 --> 00:25:48,932
But those are the words.
Those exact words.

405
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:52,266
Well, I don't remember exactly but...

406
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:58,240
...it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.

407
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,545
I'm sorry to do this to you again...

408
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:06,216
...but could you look after Ben
for a little bit?

409
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:08,010
I've got this meeting at school.

410
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:11,416
And he asked for his "fun" Aunt Rachel.

411
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,621
Well, of course I will watch him.
We have fun, don't we, Ben?

412
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:19,587
- Okay, see you later, pal.
- Okay.

413
00:26:24,903 --> 00:26:27,838
- Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.
- What?

414
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,269
Can't let him go out that way.
He's got a meeting.

415
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:33,434
- You got something here on your back.
- What?

416
00:26:34,412 --> 00:26:36,141
That's great. That is great.

417
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:38,645
What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?

418
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,411
"What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?"

419
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,080
All right, that's it. Come here.
You are in big trouble young man!

420
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:50,056
Ben, come here! I am not kidding!

421
00:26:50,261 --> 00:26:52,320
You gotta stop doing...

422
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:54,259
My God!

423
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:16,785
- So you guys doing okay?
- Yeah.

424
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:20,683
We talked and Monica made me
see that I overreacted a little bit.

425
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:24,687
- Some things are more important.
- Yeah, baby.

426
00:27:27,432 --> 00:27:30,993
I'm really glad you guys are okay,
but I just keep thinking...

427
00:27:31,302 --> 00:27:34,294
...what would've happened
if you two had hooked up.

428
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:38,936
Honey, dinner's ready!

429
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:47,149
What's my little chef
got for me tonight?

430
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:49,181
Your favorite.

431
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:51,345
Fried stuff with cheese.

432
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:54,524
And lots of it!

433
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,322
Thanks, sweetheart.

434
00:27:57,762 --> 00:27:59,161
Give me a little sugar...

435
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:05,129
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

436
00:28:09,073 --> 00:28:11,041
How you doing?

437
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:17,539
Here you go.

438
00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:19,548
Oh, my God.

439
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:21,378
This is a six-hour pill.

440
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:24,453
That's it! I'm out of the woods.

441
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:26,388
What a relief.

442
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:28,218
Good for you.

443
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:30,690
It's like a huge
weight has been lifted.

444
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:33,523
Because, look,
no hair loss, no rash, no hives.

445
00:28:33,731 --> 00:28:35,892
I'm just so happy!

446
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:40,730
Because, no shortness of breath,
no temporary euphoria...
