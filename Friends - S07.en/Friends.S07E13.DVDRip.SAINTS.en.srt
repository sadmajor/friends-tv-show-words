1
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,331
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,541
- What are you doing?
- I was thinking of moving the couch.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,072
Why would you want to do that?

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,610
So there'd be a decent place
for me to sit?

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,884
- Rach, there is a decent place.
- And your lap does not count.

6
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,223
- Come on, help me move this.
- No, no, no.

7
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:25,713
- No?
- No.

8
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,550
Rosita does not move.

9
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,865
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in...?

10
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,329
As in "Rosita does not move."

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,569
It's just a chair.
What's the big deal?

12
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:41,136
It's the exact equal distance
from the bathroom to the kitchen...

13
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:46,209
...and it's at an angle where you
don't get any glare coming off Stevie.

14
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,574
Stevie the TV?

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,647
- Is there a problem?
- No.

16
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,014
What does he know?

17
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,349
Come on, Rosita.
Us chicas gotta stick together.

18
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,100
You bitch!

19
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,965
The One Where Rosita Dies

20
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,200
Hey, you know what's weird?

21
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,073
After you guys get married,
when you introduce me to people...

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,579
...you're gonna have to say,
"This is my brother-in-law, Ross."

23
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,015
Not "my friend, Ross,"
"brother-in-law, Ross."

24
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,313
That's weird, isn't it?

25
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,714
Couldn't I just say,
"This is Ross"?

26
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,917
Sure, do whatever you want.

27
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,160
Hey, Ross?

28
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,694
I checked the real estate section.

29
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,625
Look at this.

30
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,495
Looks like Mom and Dad's house.

31
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,966
Even has a tree
with a broken limb out front.

32
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,869
And the window in the attic...

33
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,236
Oh, my God!

34
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,579
What happened
to the window in the attic?

35
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,013
- I can't believe they're selling it.
- And they didn't tell us.

36
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,721
What happened
to the window in the attic?

37
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,091
Hello, Dad? Monica and I just saw
the house in the paper.

38
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,128
Yes, we're surprised.

39
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,364
Who did you leave a message with?

40
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,599
Sorry!

41
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,536
Joey, Joey, I'm so sorry.

42
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,940
I told you not to move it!
How would you feel if, say...

43
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,478
...I wanted to move your mom, okay...

44
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,650
...and you said, "Don't,"
and I did it anyway...

45
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,715
...and her head fell off?

46
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,883
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

47
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:13,421
We'll go to the store and get you
a new chair right now.

48
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,831
She's not even cold yet.

49
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,469
Wouldn't Rosita have
wanted you to move on?

50
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:29,003
I mean, you know, she did always
put your comfort first.

51
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,475
That's true.

52
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,409
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,946
I don't want Stevie
to see her like this.

54
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:48,086
I can't believe we have to say goodbye
to the house we grew up in.

55
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,058
Man, some stranger's gonna be
in my room.

56
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,026
For 15 years they kept it
as a shrine to you.

57
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,666
It's time the velvet ropes came down.

58
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,269
They kept your room a while.

59
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:03,874
Please! Dad turned my room into
a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

60
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,079
I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack
of Victoria's Secret catalogs?

61
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,610
Not a gym.

62
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,647
- Come on. You know they love you.
- As much as they love you?

63
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,788
They thought she was barren
until I was born. It's not my fault.

64
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,089
I hate this year.

65
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,888
What's wrong with this year?

66
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,293
It's February and I've only
given two massages...

67
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,730
...and they were both horrible tippers.

68
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,766
That was me and Ross.

69
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,835
Oh, that's right.

70
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,909
If you want some extra cash...

71
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,512
...some college friends made
good money doing telemarketing.

72
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,685
That's a great idea.
You're really good on the phone.

73
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,616
It'd be better than the last
telephone job I had.

74
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,619
I probably won't have to say
"spank" as much.

75
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,924
What?

76
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,058
Oh, yeah, like you never called.

77
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,271
This is very easy.
You read from the script...

78
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,010
...and try to sell as much
toner as you can.

79
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,803
Okay, I can do that.

80
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,242
By the way, I love my office.

81
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,419
- Why don't we do a trial run?
- Oh, okay.

82
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,783
All right.

83
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,816
Hi, this is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

84
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,861
- Can I speak to your supply manager?
- I'm the supply manager.

85
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,223
I'd like to talk
about your toner needs.

86
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,434
We don't need any.

87
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,636
Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

88
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,966
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

89
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,106
Okay. What was wrong with that call?

90
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,605
Oh, well, all right.

91
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,142
No offense,
but you were kind of rude.

92
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,311
They always say they
don't need toner. That's okay.

93
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,885
Whatever they say, you can find the
answer to it, here in the script.

94
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,488
So I think you're ready to sell toner.

95
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,660
- Do you have any last questions?
- No.

96
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,088
Wait, yes, I do have one question:

97
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,830
What is toner?

98
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,300
Joey?

99
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,297
Joe?

100
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,338
Full bag?

101
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,142
Beer's still cold.

102
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,752
Something terrible
must have happened here.

103
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,592
Oh, no, no, no!

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,891
Stevie, I was never here.

105
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,039
- Dad?
- I'm here!

106
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,108
- Hey.
- Hi.

107
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,473
Seems like just yesterday you guys
used to come out to watch me work.

108
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,911
We can't believe
you're selling the house.

109
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,880
Time for a new family
to start here.

110
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,212
I hope their check clears before
they find the crack...

111
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,119
...in the foundation
and the asbestos in the ceiling.

112
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,758
Let's grab our stuff and
get the hell out of here.

113
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,597
- Sorry we can't store your things.
- Oh, it's okay.

114
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,894
I can't wait to see everything again.

115
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,001
I don't know what's down here.

116
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,766
But there are six or seven
Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

117
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,642
I used to love to play restaurant.

118
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,848
Not as much as you loved to play
"uncooked batter eater."

119
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,143
You can't expect a child to wait
for a light bulb to cook brownies.

120
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,222
So I think your boxes are over here.

121
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,756
Oh, great.

122
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,619
Hey...

123
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,762
...whose cigarettes are these?

124
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,767
I don't know.

125
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,296
They must be your mother's.

126
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:56,098
But please, please don't ask her.
I'll throw these away.

127
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,109
Cool! Dad, my report cards!

128
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,678
Hey, check this out.

129
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:09,821
Math, "A." Science, "A."
History, "A." Gym...

130
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,256
My rock polisher!

131
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,565
Oh, look, there's your old makeup kit.

132
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,335
It's a clown kit. Clown kit!

133
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,542
But the white seems to be untouched.

134
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,381
- Uh-oh.
- What?

135
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,711
You know how the garage
floods every spring?

136
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,888
How are you ever gonna sell
this place?

137
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,315
I think I accidentally
used Monica's boxes...

138
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,891
...to keep the water away
from the Porsche.

139
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,626
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?

140
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,766
What the...

141
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:01,165
Oh, God.
Everything's ruined!

142
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,533
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

143
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,346
You don't secretly smoke, do you?

144
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,478
No.

145
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,877
So it's just your mother then.

146
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,859
Hi. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

147
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,930
Can I speak to your
supply manager, please?

148
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,833
Earl. Thanks.

149
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,372
Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

150
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,042
I'd like to talk to you
about your toner needs.

151
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,707
I don't need any toner.

152
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:47,217
I hear what you're saying, but at
our prices, everyone needs toner.

153
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,944
Not me.

154
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,950
May I ask why?

155
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,624
You want to know why?

156
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,556
You want to know why?

157
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,661
I surely do.

158
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,264
Okay.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,491
I don't need any toner...

160
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,703
...because I'm gonna kill myself.

161
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,408
Is that because you're out of toner?

162
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:25,514
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

163
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,991
Wait, wait! I can't let you hang up.
Just please talk to me.

164
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,588
Well...

165
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,763
I only had one thing to do today.

166
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,430
I guess I could push it back.

167
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,465
Yeah. Now, why do you
want to kill yourself?

168
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,944
I've been working for 10 years
now at this...

169
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,114
...meaningless, dead-end job...

170
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,283
...and nobody here
even knows that I exist.

171
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,853
Chandler?

172
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,226
I'm sorry?

173
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,126
Look...

174
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,730
...I'm sure that people know
you exist.

175
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,001
Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle...

176
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,667
...surrounded by people.

177
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,896
I've been talking to you for five
minutes now about killing myself...

178
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,335
...and no one's even looked up
from their desk. Hang on.

179
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,273
Hey, everybody...

180
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,913
...I'm gonna kill myself.

181
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,943
I'll get back to you.

182
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,515
I got nothing.

183
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,812
Wait.

184
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,350
Hey, Marge.

185
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,093
Nothing. Nothing.

186
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,265
Good chair.

187
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,308
Now, if anybody asks...

188
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,171
...your name is Rosita.

189
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:15,529
Come on, Joey. I just bought you a new
chair, the most expensive one in the store.

190
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,829
You know what I was thinking?
We could name her Francette.

191
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,064
Francette?

192
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,533
What is she, a couch?

193
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,845
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

194
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,953
Joey, the new chair
will be here in an hour.

195
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,656
Maybe we should move
Rosita out of here.

196
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,051
Start the healing process.

197
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,628
Yeah, I guess you're right.

198
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,521
Maybe I'll take her down
to the incinerator.

199
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,560
It's gonna be so sad.

200
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,962
And kind of cool.

201
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,890
She's healed!

202
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,030
- That's weird.
- No, it's not weird.

203
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,995
It's a miracle!

204
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,865
It's not a miracle. I'm sure
there's an explanation.

205
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:30,098
There is. If your heart is pure,
wondrous things can happen.

206
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,206
- I don't...
- Can you tell me how this happened?

207
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,617
- Well, no.
- Miracle.

208
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,587
No, you know what, maybe somebody
came in here and fixed it. Or something.

209
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,292
Someone like an angel?

210
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:56,001
That's right, Joey. The chair angel
came in and healed your chair.

211
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,336
Get your non-believer ass
out of my chair!

212
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,984
She'll understand.
I didn't do it on purpose.

213
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,686
Dad, that won't matter to her.

214
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,180
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry.

215
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,854
And all her stuff is...

216
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,820
...growing new stuff.

217
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,659
This is the kind of thing...

218
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,898
...that makes her think
you love me more than her.

219
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,963
My God. Does she think that?

220
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,260
- Can you blame her?
- I don't know.

221
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,870
We may have favored you unconsciously.
You were a marvel.

222
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,271
- The doctors said your mom couldn't...
- I don't want to hear it.

223
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,978
- Really?
- Well, not right now.

224
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,546
Monica came here for some memories.
Damn it, we'll give her some.

225
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,477
Okay, grab...

226
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,688
Grab some boxes. We'll take stuff
from mine...

227
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,983
...and whatever we can pass off
as hers, we'll put in there.

228
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,693
- Like, this. She could have made this.
- Sure.

229
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,298
And this, she could have won this.

230
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,491
- This could have been hers.
- Sure.

231
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,631
- Here, what about this?
- Your makeup kit?

232
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,272
I'd feel better.

233
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,979
I am so psyched
I kept this chair for myself.

234
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,787
Yeah. Me too.

235
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:30,117
- Hey, how's the miracle chair?
- Fine.

236
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:35,433
You know, this thing has
speakers in the headrest?

237
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,963
- No, really?
- Yeah.

238
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,500
You can hook it to the TV
and you get radio.

239
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,868
My chair heals itself.

240
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:54,174
Earl, you're not hearing me. All I'm
saying is, you're not alone, all right?

241
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,615
Everybody hates the people
they work with.

242
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,253
Hey, guy.

243
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,861
Wait, that sounded like
someone being nice to you.

244
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,091
No, that's just the "hey, guy" guy.

245
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,998
He says that to everybody.
He's the worst.

246
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,799
I'd like to take him with me.

247
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,972
All right. Let's just forget about
the people at the office, okay?

248
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,805
There's gotta be someone
worth sticking around for.

249
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,779
What about family or friends?
Maybe a girlfriend?

250
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,713
Yeah, right.

251
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,886
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

252
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,552
- Oh, God.
- No, whatever. Anything.

253
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,922
Hey, guy.

254
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,560
Yeah, he's gotta go.

255
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,093
Okay, I should...

256
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,803
...be getting back to my thing now.

257
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,539
See you.

258
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,402
I'm not finished!
Don't you dare hang up on me!

259
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,211
The new girl's good.

260
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,213
Hey, guys.

261
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:03,047
I just whipped us up some Easy-Bake treats.
They should be ready in about three days.

262
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,052
That's a good one!
You hear that, Ross? Three days!

263
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,494
- Oh, this'll make a great memory.
- Okay.

264
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,357
Which boxes are mine?

265
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,032
- These are yours right here.
- Okay.

266
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,201
A coloring book.

267
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,035
You loved that thing.

268
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,831
You never went anywhere without...

269
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,904
...without that coloring book.

270
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,201
Really?

271
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,944
Looks like I had trouble
staying in the lines.

272
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,612
Nuh-uh!

273
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,918
- An old glove?
- Yeah, you loved that glove.

274
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,887
You took it every place you went. You
never went anyplace without the glove.

275
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,782
Wow, look at this.

276
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,688
I can't believe I even
fit into this shirt.

277
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,426
Oh, this is yours.

278
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,329
I don't know how that got in there.

279
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,636
This isn't mine.

280
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,441
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

281
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,837
Ross, these are your boxes.

282
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,941
Where are my boxes?

283
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,143
Your boxes are...

284
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,379
- What?
- Dad?

285
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:18,021
The garage flooded, sweetie,
and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry.

286
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,462
Just mine?

287
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,222
I'm afraid so.

288
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,628
Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

289
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,896
And if you say the words "medical marvel,"
I'm going to Easy-Bake your head.

290
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,470
I used your boxes to divert
water away from the Porsche.

291
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,273
Ross' stuff is fine,
but I have no memories...

292
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,314
...so you could keep the bottom
of your car from water?

293
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,010
There was also
leaves and gook and stuff.

294
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,120
I can't believe this!

295
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,826
Screw it. I'm having one.

296
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,838
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey.

297
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:08,035
How'd you like to sit
in a chair that reclines...

298
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,245
...has a rolling massage...

299
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,643
...and speakers in the headrest?

300
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,819
I've tried that so many times...

301
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,783
...they won't even let me
in the store anymore.

302
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,384
What if I said you could
do it in my apartment?

303
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,788
Are you telling me...

304
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,225
...you bought the chair
that makes all others obsolete?

305
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:32,061
The chair that Sit Magazine called
"Chair of the Year"?

306
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:34,804
I just purchased...

307
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:39,066
...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.

308
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,438
Well, that's awesome! That's great!
What made you do it?

309
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,513
It's a long story, but,
I broke Joey's chair...

310
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,243
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?

311
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,682
I thought I did, that's why
I replaced it with mine.

312
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,623
That's how it got fixed!

313
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,062
You thought that elves
came in and fixed it?

314
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,559
No.

315
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,627
Angels.

316
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,634
I'm getting my chair back.

317
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,836
Well, looks like
it wasn't healed after all!

318
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,512
I guess this chair's mine now.

319
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,206
Joey, you broke my chair!

320
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,349
Your chair?

321
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,452
He thought he broke it,
so he switched chairs.

322
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,247
So there was no miracle?

323
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,185
No, Joe. No miracle.

324
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,323
Oh, no! This is devastating!

325
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:35,395
My faith is shaken. I'm glad I have
a new chair to get me through this.

326
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,663
Nice try, but you don't
get that chair anymore.

327
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,703
That is my chair now.
You can sit on my lap.

328
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,005
No, I take that back!

329
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,605
I think I should get the chair.

330
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,117
- How do you figure?
- You broke a chair and you broke a chair.

331
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,379
The only one here that hasn't
broken a chair is me.

332
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,080
No, no, no. This chair's
not going anywhere.

333
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,022
- Where's the logic in that?
- The logic...

334
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,526
...is that there are two of us...

335
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:09,360
...and we are both strong enough
to break a chair in half.

336
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,065
So Joey breaks my chair,
and I get nothing?

337
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,674
That's right.

338
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,273
What are you guys, like,
a gang or something?

339
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,508
Yeah, we are.

340
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,853
We're the Cobras.

341
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,825
Where can I find Earl?
He's the supply manager here.

342
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,392
I don't know any Earl.

343
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,791
I'm right here!

344
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,466
Earl?

345
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,534
I'm Phoebe.

346
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,069
Phoebe?

347
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,504
The lady who sells toner?

348
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,279
Look, you can't kill yourself.

349
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,472
Look, I really appreciate
you coming down...

350
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,275
No, I can't let you do it.

351
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:04,544
- Why?
- Because, fate made me call you today.

352
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,382
I thought it was toner.

353
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,190
Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my regular job.

354
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,462
My first day, you're my first call.

355
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,134
Somebody else may have hung up,
but I wouldn't do that...

356
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,132
...because I know about this stuff.

357
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,965
- My mom killed herself.
- Really?

358
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,010
- How?
- I'm not gonna give you tips.

359
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,675
Don't you see that this...

360
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,510
...all came together so I could
stop you from doing this?

361
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,878
- Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
- No, it's fate.

362
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,691
It doesn't really seem like
enough to be fate.

363
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,051
Oh, well.

364
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,024
Okay, here's a weird thing.

365
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:49,233
My mother was also a supply manager.

366
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,532
I'm actually the office manager.

367
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,635
Oh, my God! So was she!

368
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,965
And get this, okay.

369
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,642
Your name is Earl, right?
Her name was Pearl.

370
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,005
Puh-Earl.

371
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,840
Was there anything else?

372
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,051
Sure.

373
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,653
Where're you from?

374
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,413
- Philadelphia.
- Oh, my God, so was she!

375
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,955
I've got goose bumps.

376
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,588
- Really?
- I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.

377
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,394
These jerks might not care about you...

378
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,332
...but the universe does,
and that says a lot.

379
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,832
Did you hear that?

380
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,676
I don't need you guys
to care about me...

381
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,881
...because the universe cares!

382
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,310
The whole universe!

383
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,390
I really wish they'd care
a little bit.

384
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,886
You know, I don't think it's you.
This is a freaky place.

385
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,826
Hey, guys!

386
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,458
- Oh, no, it's you.
- Yeah.

387
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,567
Oh, this is terrible.

388
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,704
Everything is destroyed.

389
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,007
Look at this.

390
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,304
It meant enough for me to save,
and now I can't tell what it is.

391
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,415
It's still soft.

392
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,649
What do you think this is?

393
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,053
I think it was a mouse.

394
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,896
- How are you, honey?
- How do you think I am?

395
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,467
You've wrecked my childhood memories...

396
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,299
...you love Ross more than me.

397
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,201
And I just rubbed
a dead mouse on my face.

398
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:44,439
Sweetheart, we love you
just as much as Ross.

399
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,480
I'm sorry about what happened...

400
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,982
...and I probably can't
make it up to you...

401
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,017
...but here's a start.

402
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,795
- What's this?
- It's the key to my Porsche.

403
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,054
Well, the key to your Porsche.

404
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,324
What?

405
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,057
What?!

406
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:09,869
I've considered getting rid of it.
I saw my reflection the other day.

407
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,167
Your mother's right,
I do look like an ass.

408
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,837
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding.

409
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,846
Well, wait a minute.

410
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,577
A couple of stupid boxes get wet,
and she gets a Porsche?

411
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,555
- Let's take a drive?
- All right!

412
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,227
What about me? I'm a medical marvel!

413
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,608
Hey, guys.

414
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,543
Have you seen Chandler's chair?

415
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,717
Joey broke it. He got rid of it.

416
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,946
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche
and the Barcalounger's gone?

417
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,125
This is the best day ever!
