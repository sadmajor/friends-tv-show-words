1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,497
The reason I asked you to brunch...

2
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:07,730
...is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,873
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:11,835
I hope it's you.

5
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,875
- I hope it's you.
- Me too.

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,675
First of all,
I love you both so much.

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,443
- You're both so important to me.
- Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

8
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,224
I was thinking we could
come up with a system...

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,517
...where we trade off
being maid of honor.

10
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,855
- Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
- Yes! Oh.

11
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:33,826
Hypothetically.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,124
Still.

13
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:40,336
If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would
be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,008
We all get to do it
and no one gets upset.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,312
- That's a pretty good idea.
- I'll do that. So, who's yours?

16
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,973
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

17
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,984
- Why is that the best part?
- I don't have to.

18
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:03,158
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

19
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,829
I'd like to make a toast.

20
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,031
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...

21
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,770
...my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that...

22
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,764
- Really not deciding.
- Fine.

23
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,103
Excuse me,
I couldn't help overhearing.

24
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,643
- You're marrying Chandler Bing?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,116
Good luck!

26
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,084
Oh, and good luck to you too!

27
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,418
What a nice lady.

28
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,984
The One With Nap Partners

29
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,727
Yeah!

30
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,228
- Die Hard, still great.
- Yep.

31
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,163
Let's make it a double feature?

32
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,563
What else you rent?

33
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,037
Die Hard 2.

34
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,839
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.

35
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:29,079
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's Die Hard 2.

36
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,741
- Joey, we just saw it.
- And?

37
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,886
It would be cool to see it again!

38
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,816
- Yeah! Die Hard!
- Die Hard!

39
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,359
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.

40
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,762
Is everything okay?

41
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,558
Yeah, I just got plans.

42
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,992
Well, John McClane had plans.

43
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,805
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up...

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,235
...and starts calling
everybody "bitch."

45
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,202
What are you talking about, bitch?

46
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,582
- Hey, Rachel.
- Yeah?

47
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,218
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

48
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,785
Really?

49
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,157
Oh, my God, Phoebe.
I mean, I'm just...

50
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,757
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,464
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

52
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,963
Oh.

53
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,369
Well, if that's what you want.

54
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,075
No way, Phoebe.
I want to be Monica's.

55
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,471
- Why does it even matter?
- Why does it matter to you?

56
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,806
Because this one is now.

57
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,713
And it's two of our best friends.

58
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,317
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

59
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,317
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?

60
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,059
You wouldn't.

61
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,798
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this...

62
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,196
...but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

63
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,439
I know you've done it at least twice.

64
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,403
- Yeah, but Phoebe...
- Please let me finish.

65
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,601
I guess that was it.

66
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,607
Okay.

67
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,847
Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

68
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,987
Oh, thank you so much!

69
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,783
Yay.

70
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,395
I'm gonna marry someone good.

71
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,264
Oh, I know.

72
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,998
Better than Chandler.

73
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,821
- What happened?
- I don't know.

74
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,922
We fell asleep. That is all.

75
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,528
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

76
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,064
All right, well, I'd better go.

77
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,168
- I think that would be best.
- Yeah.

78
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,963
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,471
- But not about this.
- No, never. Never!

80
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,006
- Bye.
- No touch. No touch.

81
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,349
Die Hard!

82
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,119
Opening a topless carwash
was a great idea.

83
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,025
We'll definitely have enough money
to open our bikini shop.

84
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,632
Now we mince the shallots like this.

85
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,467
Look, honey, the nice people
are chopping shallots.

86
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,675
Maybe if they chop enough of them,
they can open that bikini shot.

87
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,246
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

88
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,884
This woman overheard that
I was marrying you...

89
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,882
...and she wished me good luck.

90
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,254
That's sweet.

91
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,287
No, it was more like a "good luck."

92
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:06,261
Well, do you think she meant,
"Good luck taming that wild stallion."

93
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:10,628
Not judging you, a little gay.

94
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,894
So, what did this woman look like?

95
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,400
She was, like, 30,
dark hair, attractive.

96
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,840
Any chance you were looking into a
bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

97
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,537
Was it someone you dated in college?

98
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,909
No, I only dated two girls
in college...

99
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,381
...both blond, both not attractive.

100
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,854
Let me check this out.

101
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,582
- What are you doing?
- Well, let's see.

102
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,522
Okay, is that her?

103
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,025
Oh, my God, yes!

104
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,789
- Who is she?
- Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

105
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,530
Did you break up with her?

106
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,205
No, we're still together.

107
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,440
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

108
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,705
- Why?
- She came back the third summer...

109
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,352
...and she'd gotten really fa...

110
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,613
- Fat?
- I did not say fat.

111
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,393
I said fa...

112
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,293
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

113
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,193
Yeah. Yeah.

114
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,595
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

115
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,067
Apparently she does.

116
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,070
You know what they say:
"Elephants never forget."

117
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,478
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

118
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,146
Rach, wanna come with me Friday night?
I'm gonna check out some male strippers.

119
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,120
For the bachelorette party?

120
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,291
Yes.

121
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,456
Hey, what's going on?

122
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,595
She's Monica's maid of honor.

123
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,997
Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

124
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,674
You have been maid of honor before?

125
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:59,503
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

126
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,279
That's it. I am maid of honor.

127
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,482
- No, I am.
- How come you are?

128
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,275
Because I cared enough to lie.

129
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,144
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

130
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,788
We could have an audition.

131
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,959
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

132
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,287
- What do you mean?
- When I want a job...

133
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,589
...I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see...

134
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:21,595
...I get the part.

135
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,468
Then they send you a script.
You go to the set.

136
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,569
You rehearse and you
have wardrobe fittings.

137
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,637
Then you shoot your part.
And it's great.

138
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,674
But right after that, you're back out
on the street looking for work again.

139
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,210
Right back where you started.

140
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:39,009
So I gotta say, I don't think a career in
acting is the right choice for you two.

141
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,551
Joey, the maid of honor thing.

142
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,327
Right.

143
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,261
So, okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

144
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,627
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

145
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,596
- It's better than us deciding.
- Oh, this is crazy.

146
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,307
- Can't we just flip a coin?
- No, coins hate me.

147
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,906
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

148
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:09,974
Hi!

149
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,308
Ross, sweetie.

150
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,217
Hey there, handsome thing.

151
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,892
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

152
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,095
Hey.

153
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,272
Just brought back your videos.

154
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,239
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

155
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,343
No. No, we don't.

156
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,678
Yes, we do.

157
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,242
Now, look.
That was the best nap I ever had.

158
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,450
I don't know what
you're talking about.

159
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,589
Come on, admit it.

160
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,796
That was the best nap you ever had.

161
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,455
I've had better.

162
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,929
Okay. When?

163
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,403
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

164
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,036
I said it, okay?

165
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,141
But it's over, Joey!

166
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,579
I want to do it again.

167
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,349
We can't do it again.

168
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,886
- Why not?
- Because it's weird!

169
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,653
Fine.

170
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:28,959
You want a drink?

171
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:32,561
- Sure. What do you got?
- Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

172
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,937
Chandler.

173
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,967
I just figured out who you are.

174
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,336
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

175
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,215
- You're Louis Posen.
- Who?

176
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,483
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

177
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,916
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

178
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,281
Do you know why?

179
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:02,618
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

180
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,189
No, but because he thought
I was too fa...

181
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,463
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

182
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,172
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

183
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,375
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 16 years ago.

184
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,171
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

185
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,780
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

186
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,577
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

187
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,320
- I can live with that.
- Okay.

188
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,822
- So how do we find her.
- She probably lives in the city.

189
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,723
- She was eating in that restaurant.
- I'll bet she was.

190
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,425
What is wrong with me?

191
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:49,169
Okay, we'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

192
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,706
You'll be scored
on a scale of one to ten.

193
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,209
- One being the highest.
- Ten is the highest.

194
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,541
- Why is 10 the highest?
- Because it's the highest.

195
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,515
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

196
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,313
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

197
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,583
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

198
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,955
I don't want to marry Chandler.

199
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,290
- I've got cold feet.
- It's gonna be okay.

200
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,865
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

201
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,469
This means I'll never
get to sleep with Joey.

202
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,808
Look, Monica...

203
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,044
...getting cold feet is very common.

204
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,542
It's just because
of all the anticipation.

205
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,682
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

206
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,352
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

207
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,952
You don't get to keep the gifts.

208
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,915
Drawing on your own experience.

209
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,319
Very good.

210
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,790
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

211
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,156
Thank you, judges.

212
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,366
- Kiss ass.
- Oh.

213
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,401
- Okay, Phoebe.
- Yes, Your Honor.

214
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,066
We're now in the ceremony.

215
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,174
Monica is about to say, "I do"...

216
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,705
...when her drunk uncle
starts yelling.

217
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,173
What do you do? Go!

218
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,914
When Monica was a little girl...

219
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,913
...I remember that...

220
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,086
Ow!

221
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,687
- Very good!
- Oh.

222
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,187
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

223
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,690
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

224
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,557
Hey, you want
a little taste of Pheebs?

225
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,300
Ladies, please. Please.

226
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,528
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel.

227
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,639
The wedding is about to start.

228
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:33,244
You walk into the back room and you
find Monica taking a nap with Ross.

229
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,946
I'll be Monica. Go!

230
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,637
No, no, no!

231
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,519
This situation is not sanctioned!

232
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,155
Now, we're moving on to the next one.

233
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,916
Okay.

234
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,131
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

235
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,799
We haven't even prepared...

236
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,230
- Go!
- Okay, okay, okay.

237
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,735
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as...

238
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:06,273
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it.

239
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:11,211
I met... I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds...

240
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:16,147
...and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25...

241
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,617
...although he seemed
like a 6-year-old.

242
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,758
Oh.

243
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,620
Thank you. Thank you very much.

244
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,091
I've known them
separately and together.

245
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,235
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are in the presence of love.

246
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,598
So I would like to raise my glass...

247
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,433
...to Monica and Chandler...

248
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,943
...and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

249
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,649
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

250
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,018
Wow.

251
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,415
- Great speech.
- Yeah, it really was.

252
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,647
Oh, thanks.

253
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:58,625
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

254
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,058
Okay.

255
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,469
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

256
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,141
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel...

257
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,039
...while we were
showering together, naked.

258
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,252
And she's back in the game!

259
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:33,663
Julie. Hi.

260
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,060
Chandler Bing.
I guess you remember me.

261
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,267
Hello, Skidmark.

262
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,267
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

263
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,242
It's pretty clear.

264
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,281
I owe you a long, overdue apology.

265
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,815
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because of your weight.

266
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,451
That's why you broke up with me?

267
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,690
You didn't know that?

268
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,791
Well, I guess my work here is done.

269
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,636
Can I get you guys something to drink
while you tabulate?

270
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,397
Actually, the final
vote has been tallied.

271
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,543
- I'll take a cocoa.
- Too late.

272
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:24,774
But first of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

273
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,449
You should be proud.

274
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:31,280
And I'd also like to say, in this
competition, there are no losers.

275
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,718
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

276
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,784
Really? I won.

277
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,826
- What?
- I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

278
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,660
- Well, then I demand a recount!
- Actually, it wasn't that close.

279
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,804
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

280
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,166
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

281
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,868
Heads.

282
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,278
What? The coins have
finally forgiven me!

283
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,880
Know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her...

284
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,986
...vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

285
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,822
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

286
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,591
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

287
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,892
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

288
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,196
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

289
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,641
Why would I care about that?

290
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,813
No reason. I'm just saying that...

291
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,216
...that's where I'll be.

292
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,898
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

293
00:17:56,175 --> 00:18:00,305
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

294
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,912
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

295
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,082
- Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
- I'd love it if I could do both.

296
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,789
All right, I have to ask.

297
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,259
What?

298
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,688
Will you break up with me
if I get fat?

299
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:18,988
What?

300
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,394
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

301
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,795
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

302
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,398
In one year?

303
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,764
My God, what did she eat?
Her family?

304
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,768
That's not the point.

305
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:37,743
I know it was a stupid reason to
break up with someone, but I was 15.

306
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:42,010
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

307
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,322
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

308
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,547
You called me fat.

309
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,918
Wait a minute.

310
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,595
- That was totally different.
- How?

311
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,493
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

312
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,063
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

313
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,704
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

314
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,706
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

315
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,947
This is one of the things that
I can apologize for later.

316
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,882
What I mean is, you're Monica.

317
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,024
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

318
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,816
Keep going.

319
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,861
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down...

320
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,997
...and I will still love you.

321
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,628
Even if I were to shrink down
to 2 inches tall?

322
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,538
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

323
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,043
I love you.

324
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:45,047
Skidmark still got a way
with the ladies.

325
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,842
Hi, Pheebs.

326
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,384
- Hi.
- Hi.

327
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,213
I just want to apologize.

328
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,721
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

329
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,294
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

330
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,857
Oh, you mean today. Yeah.

331
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,168
Yeah, and you know,
you deserve to win.

332
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,200
And I was thinking about it.

333
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,443
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

334
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,646
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

335
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,051
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

336
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,049
- Just in case.
- Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

337
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,382
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

338
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,683
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

339
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,556
Here's a picture from one Halloween
where she dressed up as a bride.

340
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,288
She made me carry her train...

341
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,535
...which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

342
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,806
Oh, and here's
a little purse that I found.

343
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,736
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

344
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,502
- Oh.
- Something. And...

345
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,046
...vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

346
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,581
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

347
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,914
This stuff is great.

348
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,351
I forgot this was in here.

349
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,195
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

350
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,989
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed."

351
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:11,964
And it's blue.

352
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,008
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

353
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,447
You do?

354
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,409
- Why?
- Because I think it means more to you.

355
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,449
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

356
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,691
It's fine.
I mean, this is something...

357
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:37,350
...that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 14?

358
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,562
No, I was 10.
I just developed early.

359
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,297
Man alive!

360
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,833
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey!

361
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,008
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

362
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,635
Oh, that's great!

363
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,108
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

364
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,283
I have really specific ideas.

365
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,451
We should meet four times a week.

366
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,417
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

367
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,149
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

368
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,060
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

369
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,702
She's gonna be yours.

370
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,482
Great nap.

371
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,519
It really was.

372
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,803
What the hell are you doing?

373
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,109
God!

374
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,675
Excuse me.
