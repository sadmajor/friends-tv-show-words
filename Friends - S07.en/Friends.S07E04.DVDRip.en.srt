What did you guys think?

7
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:35,481  X1:232 X2:483 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, the phone.
- I got it. I got it.

8
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:38,085  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hold on. It's your mom.

00:00:38,332 --> 00:00:40,129  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:450 Y2:524

10
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,442  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ma, so what did you think?

11
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:44,487  X1:300 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well...

12
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:47,167  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:524
...that was okay.

13
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:48,686  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:488 Y2:524
It wasn't the best.

14
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:51,281  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
That was one
of the worst things ever...

15
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:54,887  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and not just on TV.

16
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:57,682  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What should we say?
- The lighting was okay.

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,890  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
You got lighting last time.
Lighting is mine.

18
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:02,321  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524

19
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:03,925  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:488 Y2:524
That means I'm stuck with:

- I don't know.

22
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,523  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:524
I can't lie to him again.
Oh, no, l... No.

23
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:18,411  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm just gonna press
my breasts up against him.

24
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:21,848  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:446 Y2:524
- And say nothing?
- Yeah, that's right.

25
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,763  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wow, my folks really liked it.

00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:35,285  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:524

at least let me finish mine.

44
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,205  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:052 Y2:094

45
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:59,121  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:524

47
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:07,525  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:052 Y2:131

51
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,768  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:052 Y2:131
- What?
- Well, since you ask... .

52
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:21,480  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:052 Y2:131
They want me back on

54
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:24,361  X1:288 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, hey!

57
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:35,332  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got a head rush
from standing up too fast.

58
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:42,644  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:524
You were at this job four years?

59
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:47,170  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's right.
- This is all very impressive, Hilda.

60
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:49,562  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just have one last question for you.

61
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:52,530  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
How did I do? Was this okay?

62
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:55,928  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What?
- I've never interviewed anyone.

63
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,163  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've never had anyone work for me.

64
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:01,563  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:524
When I was a kid we had a maid,
but this isn't the same.

65
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:03,968  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, dear, it's not.

66
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:06,365  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524
And I know that.

67
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:09,648  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, thank you so much for coming in.

68
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,803  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Nice to meet you.
- Good meeting you.

69
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,371  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right.

70
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:16,370  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm a total pro.

71
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:19,967  X1:301 X2:414 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hello.
- Wow.

72
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:24,291  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
Hi, yes, I'm sorry.
The models are down the hall.

73
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,682  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm here about the assistant job.

74
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:28,161  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

75
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:32,611  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, well, then, all right.
Well, just have a seat there.

76
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:34,080  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:524
So what's your name?

77
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:35,361  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Tag Jones.

78
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:37,330  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:524
Uh-huh, go on.

79
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,363  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's it. That's my whole name.

80
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:42,568  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's your whole name.
Of course.

81
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:45,407  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, let's just have a look-see here.

82
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,201  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
I haven't worked in an office before.
I don't have much experience...

83
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:53,365  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
What are you talking about?
You got three years painting houses...

84
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:57,362  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:446 Y2:524
...two whole summers
at TGI Friday's.

85
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,201  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:486 Y2:524
It's lame, I know.

86
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:02,171  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
But I'm a goal-oriented person,
eager to learn...

87
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,169  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
Just hold on a second, please.

88
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:12,371  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's for human resources. Everybody
has to. Would you stand up?

89
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:21,571  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, no, no.

90
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,366  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

91
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:40,572  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Anyway, I should go.
- Okay. Bye.

92
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:42,490  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi, sweetie.

93
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,688  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
What was with all the whispering?

94
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:47,043  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

95
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:50,888  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:524
Secret? Married people aren't
supposed to have secrets.

96
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:53,646  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:524
We love and respect
one another too much.

97
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:56,561  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:486 Y2:524
But still, no.

98
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:01,371  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
We should tell each other everything.
I don't have secrets from you.

99
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:05,884  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
Really? So tell me what happened
to Ross, junior year at Disneyland.

100
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,770  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, I can't do that.

101
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,408  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll tell you what Phoebe said.

102
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,161  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay.
- Okay.

103
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,642  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
So Ross and I
are going to Disneyland.

104
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,962  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:524
We stop at this restaurant for tacos.

105
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:21,649  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:524
When I say restaurant, I mean a guy,
a hibachi, and the trunk of his car.

106
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:24,209  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:488 Y2:524
So Ross has about ten tacos.

107
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:28,809  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:524
Anyway, we're on Space Mountain
and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.

108
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:30,565  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God. He threw up?

109
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:33,690  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, he visited a town
a little south of throw up.

110
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:38,524  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:488 Y2:524
What was Phoebe's secret?

111
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:42,571  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:524
Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's
old massage place, is getting fired.

112
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,330  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's it? I gave up my
Disneyland story for that?

113
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:52,166  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's right. You lose, sucker!

114
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:56,170  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
Please still marry me.

115
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:01,763  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:524
You have an assistant, right?

116
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:03,001  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:488 Y2:524
Did she call?

117
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:06,927  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
You told her I was sick, right?
Always tell her I am sick.

118
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,366  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know.
How do you decide who to hire?

119
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:12,210  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:524
I have it down to two people.

120
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:15,364  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
One has great references
and a lot of experience.

121
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:17,881  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:524
- And then, there's this guy.
- What about him?

122
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,646  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
I love him.

123
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,363  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's so pretty, I want to cry.

124
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,891  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know what to do.

125
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:29,568  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
Come on, you know what to do.
You hire the first one.

126
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:34,243  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't hire assistants because they're
cute. Do it because they're qualified.

127
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:36,160  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Uh-huh.

128
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:41,684  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
I hear you. You make a lot of sense.
Can I just say one more thing?

129
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:43,081  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look how pretty.

130
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:46,081  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let me see.

131
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,963  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

132
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,408  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh. But, no.

133
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:54,724  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
No. You can't hire him
because it's not professional.

134
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,363  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
This is for me, yes?

135
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:02,164  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, you're right.
I'll hire Hilda tomorrow.

136
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:05,051  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
Dumb, old, perfect-for-the-job Hilda.

137
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:06,801  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let me see.

138
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,563  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow!

139
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:12,768  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:524
Don't show this to Monica.

140
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:15,281  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:488 Y2:524
And don't tell her about the "Wow! "

141
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,605  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Terry.

142
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,968  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Nice to see you again.
- Been a while.

143
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,891  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
Funny, these halls look smaller
than they used to.

144
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,369  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's a different building.

145
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:33,567  X1:311 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:524
So...

146
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:36,202  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
...Stryker Ramoray, huh?

147
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:38,602  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
- When do I start?
- How about right now?

148
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,171  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

149
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:42,768  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:488 Y2:524
Here are the audition scenes.

150
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,686  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
I thought you
were offering me the part.

151
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:49,967  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why?

152
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:53,562  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray,
Stryker's twin brother.

153
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:56,201  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who looks more like me than me, right?

154
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:59,366  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
Everybody has to audition.

155
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:03,970  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know, Terry,
I don't really need to do this.

156
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,766  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
I got my own cable TV series...

157
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:08,770  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:524
...with a robot.

158
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:12,885  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, Joey.
That's the way it is.

159
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:14,960  X1:300 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well...

160
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,002  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:524
...I guess you think
you're pretty special.

161
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:21,562  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
Sitting up here in your fancy,
small-halled building...

162
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,487  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
...making stars jump
through hoops for you.

163
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,165  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, you know what?

164
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:31,645  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
This is one star whose hoop...

165
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:33,962  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is the star the hoop...
This hoop...

166
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:36,089  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray!

167
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,886  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?

168
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:49,408  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
I came to thank you for not laughing
in my face yesterday.

169
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:52,928  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
I noticed there were no plants
so I brought you your first.

170
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:55,368  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
There is a plant in your office.

171
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:57,491  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Kind of.

172
00:09:58,412 --> 00:09:59,447  X1:306 X2:410 Y1:484 Y2:524
Right.

173
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,646  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:524
So I guess I shouldn't put
"good at noticing stuff" on my résumé.

174
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:06,083  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Thank you.
- Anyway...

175
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:08,289  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I'm guessing you hired somebody.

176
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:10,081  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well... .

177
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:11,646  X1:292 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:524
Gotcha.

178
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,043  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thanks again for meeting with me.

179
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:17,046  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:524
But I hired you.

180
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,843  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What?
- Yeah, you got the job.

181
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,963  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You're my new assistant.
- I am?

182
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,565  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.

183
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:28,849  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I can't believe it.
- Me either.

184
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,521  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
First, I need you to go downstairs...

185
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,411  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
...find a woman named Hilda,
and tell her to go home.

186
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:42,130  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hey, good you're home.

187
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:45,485  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
Always nicer to hear than,
"Oh, crap, you again. "

188
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,248  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, sweetie, I made you a surprise.

189
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:51,244  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, tacos.

190
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,330  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
Ever since that story,
I've had such a craving.

191
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,283  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you not understand the story?

192
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,005  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

193
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,490  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
Nothing. Just figuring out
what to do for dinner.

194
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:11,209  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
Hey, what's that? Dinner stuff?
You making dinner?

195
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:12,481  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

196
00:11:16,012 --> 00:11:17,525  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:524
What's over there? Tacos?

197
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:19,330  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
No. No.

198
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:24,207  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're just ground beef smileys.

199
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,366  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:524
Those are tacos.

200
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:30,006  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:486 Y2:524
Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.

201
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:34,606  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:524
Either way, I'll pass.
Still can't eat those.

202
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:43,120  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's so funny?

203
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:50,285  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm not laughing.

204
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:00,284  X1:258 X2:456 Y1:488 Y2:524
You told her!

205
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,806  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
Nancy Thompson's getting fired.

206
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:10,651  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, okay. I had food poisoning.
It's not like I chose to do it!

207
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:14,601  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's not like I said,
"What would make this ride more fun?"

208
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:19,201  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:524
Right. You're right, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be laughing.

209
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,727  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
I should be
laying down papers for you.

210
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:27,411  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
- How could you?
- I had to. We're getting married.

211
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:30,001  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
Married couples can't keep secrets.

212
00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:33,010  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
I guess Monica should know
about Atlantic City.

213
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,611  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Dude!

214
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:38,610  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What happened?
- Chandler and I are in a bar...

215
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:41,121  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
Did you not hear me say, "Dude"?

216
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:45,123  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and this girl
is making eyes at Chandler.

217
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:49,928  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
So he goes over to her and, after
a minute or two, I see them kissing.

218
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:54,444  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're thinking he's not the type
to go to bars and make out with girls.

219
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,603  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:444 Y2:524
And you're right.
He's not the type...

220
00:12:56,852 --> 00:13:00,811  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
...to go to bars
and make out with girls.

221
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:04,323  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:524
You kissed a guy?

222
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:07,605  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

223
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:11,851  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
In my defense, it was dark
and he was a very pretty guy.

224
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,250  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard...

225
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:19,002  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
So hard we had to throw out
your underwear again?

226
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,408  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

227
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:30,771  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hey.

228
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,650  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
How's Hilda working out?

229
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:37,762  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my new assistant
is working out. Yes.

230
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:39,810  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
She happy she got the job?

231
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:45,211  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
My new assistant is very happy
that I hired my new assistant.

232
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:48,566  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hello.

233
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:51,042  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?

234
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:55,245  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's the producers at <i>Mac and Cheese, </i>
if you'll excuse me for a minute.

235
00:13:56,932 --> 00:14:01,164  X1:103 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, funny you should call. I was
just looking over next week's script.

236
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:03,571  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:524
Canceled!

237
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,887  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:524
Like, they're taking it off the air?

238
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:11,170  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, I'll see you Monday.

239
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,525  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're not even shooting them anymore?

240
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,962  X1:248 X2:466 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right. Bye.

241
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,208  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
They canceled <i>Mac and Cheese</i>!

242
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:21,726  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Joey.

243
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:24,605  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
Why would they do that?
It was a good show, right?

244
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:38,801  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
You want to tell secrets?
Okay, in college...

245
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,964  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:524
...Ross used to wear leg warmers.

246
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:48,162  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:524
All right, Chandler entered a Vanilla
Ice look-alike contest and won.

247
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:51,968  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ross came in fourth and cried!

248
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:56,927  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, is that funny?
You find that funny?

249
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:59,851  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe Chandler should know
your secrets too.

250
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:04,010  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:524
I already told him everything.
You shush!

251
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:07,127  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
Once, she was sent to bed
without dinner...

252
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:10,205  X1:151 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
...so she ate the macaroni off
a jewelry box she'd made.

253
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:16,447  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:524
Ross stayed home every Saturday night
to watch <i>Golden Girls. </i>

254
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:21,326  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Monica couldn't tell time
until she was 13.

255
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,488  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's hard for some people!

256
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,804  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
Of course it is.

257
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,923  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
<i>Wow. </i>

258
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:33,330  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Chandler wore my underwear to work!
- Hey!

259
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,931  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, I couldn't think
of any more for Ross.

260
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:39,850  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:524
In college, Chandler got drunk...

261
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:42,925  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and slept with the lady
who cleaned our dorm.

262
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:45,166  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:524
That was you.

263
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:50,526  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

264
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:54,324  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
How could this happen to me?

265
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:59,088  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yesterday, I had two TV shows.
Today, I got nothing.

266
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:02,051  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait a minute,
what happened to <i>Days of our Lives</i>?

267
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,244  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, they might be a little mad
at me over there.

268
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:06,841  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
What happened?

269
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:12,041  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, maybe I got a little upset, and
maybe I told them where they could go.

270
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,648  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey, why would you do that?

271
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,247  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:484 Y2:524
Because! They wanted me to audition.

272
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:20,728  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:486 Y2:524
You, an actor? That's madness!

273
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,644  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:488 Y2:524
Rachel Green's office.

274
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,041  X1:314 X2:400 Y1:484 Y2:524
Tag.

275
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,691  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:486 Y2:524
Hi, who was that?

276
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:38,044  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
Nobody. I was just practicing.

277
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,441  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

278
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:47,645  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi, Rachel Green's office.

279
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:50,850  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:524
You must be Hilda.

280
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:56,283  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:524
He's Tag. This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?

281
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:57,647  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Phoebe.

282
00:16:58,132 --> 00:16:59,884  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Great name.
- You like that?

283
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:02,652  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You should hear my phone number.
- Okay.

284
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:10,650  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
So you hired yourself
a little treat, did you?

285
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:14,082  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:524
I know how it looks,
but I am telling you...

286
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,721  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't get involved
with your assistant.

287
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:21,488  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:446 Y2:524
I know that, and I know hiring him was
not the smartest thing I've ever done.

288
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:25,281  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
But, from now on,
I swear this is strictly professional.

289
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:26,885  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Yes.
- Hey, Rachel.

290
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:28,081  X1:326 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hi.

291
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:30,766  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
Cute assistant. What's his story?

292
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,162  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Is he...
- Gay? Yeah.

293
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,890  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Terry.

294
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:42,326  X1:246 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey Tribbiani.

295
00:17:42,532 --> 00:17:46,081  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
Surprised your big head
could fit through our small halls.

296
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:49,288  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I gotta go, Joey.
- Wait, Terry! Look.

297
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,363  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm really sorry about before.

298
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,684  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big
to audition for you.

299
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:57,048  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Give me another chance.
- I can't.

300
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:59,004  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait, Terry, please!

301
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,087  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look, I just lost my other job, okay?

302
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:05,369  X1:079 X2:635 Y1:488 Y2:524
You have no idea how much I need this.

303
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:07,045  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:524
Please, help me out.

304
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:09,243  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:488 Y2:524
For old times' sake.

305
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:13,689  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:524
This guy's been in a coma
for five years. It's hopeless.

306
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,810  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray
is a miracle worker.

307
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:18,042  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:524
Here he comes.

308
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,251  X1:247 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Good morning.

309
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:30,643  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:524
Drake, it's your brother, Stryker.
Can you hear me?

310
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:32,843  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:488 Y2:524
And cut.

311
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,848  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm back, baby!

312
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,967  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know, in my defense...

313
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:54,648  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
...there was no glitter on
the macaroni and very little glue.

314
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,482  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
And in my defense,
the cleaning lady came on to me.

315
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:02,770  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Do you have trouble telling time now?
- No.

316
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:05,606  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Quick, what time is it?
- Time to kiss a guy?

317
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:12,251  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you laughing at, Pampers?

318
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:16,488  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know when I said
married people...

319
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:19,451  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
...should share everything
and not have any secrets?

320
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,241  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Yeah?
- That was stupid. Let's not do that.

321
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:24,922  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:524
Absolutely.

322
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:29,091  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
We should keep the stuff we told
each other secret from everyone else.

323
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,084  X1:237 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, definitely.

324
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,329  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay. If you'll excuse me...

325
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:38,565  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I'm gonna hang out with people who
don't know the Space Mountain story.

326
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:42,886  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
- Man!

327
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:48,604  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
Not that you would, but I wouldn't
hang out with the guys at my office.

328
00:19:58,812 --> 00:19:59,801  X1:326 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hi.

329
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:04,447  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

330
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:08,368  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:524
I got asked out twice today
while I was at lunch...

331
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,250  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:484 Y2:524
...by guys.

332
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:13,601  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Really?
- Yeah.

333
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,128  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you tell someone that I was gay?

334
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:19,529  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, did you not want people
to know that?

335
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:25,328  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't
want you to think I was gay.

336
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:27,325  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:052 Y2:093
Why is that?

337
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:32,528  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:052 Y2:132
- I don't think I should say.
- Oh, you can say.

338
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,807  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:052 Y2:132
Come on, I don't want you to feel
like you can't tell me things.

339
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:41,527  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Okay.
- Okay.

340
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,244  X1:296 X2:419 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Well...
- Yeah.

341
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,887  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:052 Y2:132
...I'd love to ask out
your friend Phoebe.

342
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:51,484  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:052 Y2:094
Yeah, she's gay.
