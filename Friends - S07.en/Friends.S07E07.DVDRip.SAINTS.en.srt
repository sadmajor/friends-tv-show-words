1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:04,731
- Morning.
- Hi.

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,637
How was your date?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,105
- Pretty good.
- Oh, good.

4
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,402
My God. Sorry about that.

5
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,506
Okay, really good.

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,450
I gotta go. I'm late.

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,619
You're going to leave
her with me?

8
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,787
Don't worry,
she's a terrific girl.

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,351
Can you do me a favor?

10
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:28,890
Could you mention I'm not looking
for a relationship? That'd be great.

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,857
What, are you kidding?

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,361
Just casually slip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

13
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,761
Tell her I'm a loner.
No, an outlaw.

14
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,939
She doesn't want to get mixed up
with the likes of me.

15
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,436
That's a lot to remember.

16
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,676
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?

17
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,538
I'm gonna call her later myself.

18
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,939
Honest.

19
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,082
Chandler used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

20
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,877
He'd make extras
and leave them for me.

21
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:58,515
I'm not telling her anything.
It's not my responsibility.

22
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,918
Fine.

23
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,492
Now, where did we land
on those pancakes?

24
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,359
- Hi.
- Hi.

25
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,627
Sorry, but I couldn't get
that lock to work.

26
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,772
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
when I moved in.

27
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:18,001
- You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
- Hi.

28
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:23,011
I don't mean this to sound like high
school, but did he talk about me?

29
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,151
Would you like some pancakes?

30
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:32,814
The One With Ross's Library Book

31
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:10,455
- Come on. Why are we here?
- Okay, okay, take a guess.

32
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,295
The hot chicks?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the library computer earlier...

34
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,196
...you know, for fun.

35
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,466
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up.

36
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,504
My doctoral dissertation.

37
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:28,645
It's right down here in the biggest
library in the university.

38
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,382
Wow, that's actually pretty cool.

39
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,851
There's also a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

40
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,319
What is that?

41
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,854
Sounds like two people are really
enjoying the Dewey Decimal System.

42
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,697
We're so sorry.

43
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:57,498
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

44
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,508
She sent the chicken back again?

45
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,720
She said it's too dry and wants
to explain to you how she wants it.

46
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,150
I'd like to meet this chicken expert.

47
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,086
Send the colonel in.

48
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:22,491
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,927
Lucky bastard.

50
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,370
- Janice.
- How are you...

51
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:34,478
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

52
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,682
I'm fine.

53
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:42,216
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm blind.

54
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:48,260
Somebody's been doing a little
cooking outside the restaurant.

55
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,522
So who's the lucky guy?

56
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,703
Funny story.

57
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:07,877
Hey, what's up?

58
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,310
Hey, who's your friend?

59
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,316
- Hey, Joey.
- Erin.

60
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,584
You're still here.

61
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:23,960
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

62
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,825
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.

63
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,294
And then there's you guys.

64
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,732
Well, listen, I better get going.

65
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,267
Today was great. Thanks.

66
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,073
And, Joey, last night was fun.

67
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,539
Yeah. I'll call you.

68
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,610
- I'll call you too.
- Or I'll call you.

69
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,349
- And call me.
- Okay.

70
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,111
Look at that,
we're all gonna call each other.

71
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,652
Good to see you again.

72
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,583
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

73
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,159
The system kind of broke down, huh?

74
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,497
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
tell her all those things.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,427
And we got to talking, and I...

76
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,600
We want you to marry her.

77
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,505
What?

78
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,105
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

79
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,071
Who do you think brought her here?

80
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,604
Cupid.

81
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,146
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.

82
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:20,012
Man, do you know what guys want.

83
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,385
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

84
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:29,752
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.

85
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,462
My beers?!

86
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,828
Look, she's a very nice girl.

87
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,934
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

88
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,501
You always say that.

89
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,469
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it would go somewhere.

90
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,370
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't think so.

91
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,740
- Whatever.
- Fine.

92
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,676
Hey, don't start judging me.

93
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,679
You're in love with your assistant.

94
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,480
You're having an affair with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

95
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,616
Phoebe!

96
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,790
Secret affair.

97
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,696
What did I say?

98
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,433
Hey, cutie-cutie.

99
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,709
So I ran into someone you know
today at work.

100
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,003
Oh, yeah? Who was it?

101
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:25,248
Oh, my God.

102
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,647
I am so sorry, sweetie.

103
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,685
Are you okay?

104
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:34,220
You didn't tell her we're engaged?

105
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,826
- She saw the ring.
- Did she freak out?

106
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,123
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most people.

107
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,569
She actually has a boyfriend herself.

108
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,198
Name's Clark.

109
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,230
She also invited herself
to our wedding.

110
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,837
Clark too.

111
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,173
You said no, right?

112
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,052
You said no, right?

113
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,220
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

114
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,320
- What was I supposed to do?
- Lie.

115
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,887
How hard is that?
"Your check's in the mail."

116
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,390
"Oh, your baby's so cute."

117
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,427
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."

118
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,199
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

119
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,102
Think she'll sit quietly?
Think she'll want to make a toast?

120
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,938
You don't think she'll want
to sing "Part-Time Lover"?

121
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,208
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
the chicken either, is she?

122
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,050
You know what? Lt'll be okay.

123
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,723
She's probably not gonna even
want to come.

124
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,223
- Really?
- No, that was a lie.

125
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,663
See how easy that was?

126
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,262
So you would have just lied?

127
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,830
Yes.

128
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:54,866
- It would have really been that easy?
- Yes.

129
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,008
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and Clark.

130
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,817
Hi.

131
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,791
What's wrong?

132
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,723
People are doing it
in front of my book.

133
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:19,963
I'm sorry?

134
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:24,732
My doctoral dissertation is in the
library at school. I went to see it.

135
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:29,973
And there were students making babies
right in the paleontology section.

136
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,471
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

137
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,576
- That's not the point.
- I know that's not the point.

138
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,342
I'm trying to make it the point.

139
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,912
At your school...

140
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:46,022
...was there a place on campus
where students went to fool around?

141
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,416
Yeah, there was.

142
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,959
In the corner of the library where all
the books were that nobody ever read.

143
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,165
Yes, there was.

144
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:58,433
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.

145
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,270
Hold on a second.

146
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,370
Fifth floor, against that back wall?

147
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,240
Oh, for crying out loud!

148
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,748
- So we should go catch our movie.
- What's the rush?

149
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:15,509
I like to see the previews.

150
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,912
The candy.

151
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,455
- Oh, hey.
- Well, look who's here.

152
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,127
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Erin.

153
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,523
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

154
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,266
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

155
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:31,926
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

156
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:36,197
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

157
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,205
Oh, no.

158
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,143
What party?

159
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,174
- A birthday party.
- A birthday party.

160
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,579
Whose birthday party?

161
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,045
- Alison's birthday party.
- Alison's birthday party.

162
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,615
And how old is Alison?

163
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,187
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two.

164
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,953
- I feel so terrible ditching you like this.
- No, that's okay.

165
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,429
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

166
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,966
Look how that worked out.

167
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:11,307
- You want to catch a movie?
- Yeah, sure. That will be fun.

168
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,603
Guess I'll talk to you guys
after Alison's party.

169
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,374
- That, actually, might go late.
- I'll wait up.

170
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:27,120
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

171
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:31,921
Do you know the paleontology section,
fifth floor, stack 437?

172
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,995
Well, yes.
Just give me five minutes.

173
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,101
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

174
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,336
No, no, no.

175
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,507
Can I speak to someone in charge?

176
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,213
How can I help?

177
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,613
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
to increase security...

178
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,683
...in the paleontology section?

179
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,513
I wrote a book that's up there.

180
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,018
And instead of reading it,
people are...

181
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,228
Well, they're rolling around
in front of it.

182
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,491
We are aware of the problem
you're referring to.

183
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:15,664
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

184
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,205
I can't help you.

185
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,939
Well, fine.

186
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,942
If I'm the only person
with any appreciation...

187
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:26,777
...of the sanctity of the written word,
then I'll go defend it myself.

188
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:29,284
Don't you follow me.

189
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,826
- How did it go with Erin?
- Unbelievable.

190
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,960
We had the best time.

191
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,591
- So you're not mad anymore?
- No, no. You guys were totally right.

192
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,929
This was much better than
the first date.

193
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,571
That was awkward.
We were both nervous.

194
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,742
- Didn't you sleep together?
- Yeah, that calms me down.

195
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:55,575
And we have so much in common.

196
00:11:55,848 --> 00:12:00,683
She loves sandwiches, sports.
Although she is a Met fan.

197
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,746
Not an issue now,
but if we had kids...

198
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,720
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
about having kids.

199
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,087
Oh, my Joey.

200
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,524
Please don't get married before I do.

201
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,600
I just cannot believe
that Clark stood me up.

202
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:28,238
He may still show up.

203
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,674
What are you, stupid?

204
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,249
- It's been three hours.
- Is that all?

205
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,913
I just feel like such a fool.
I thought this guy was my soul mate.

206
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,388
I thought I was your soul mate.

207
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,189
What am I doing?

208
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,332
You know, let's just...
Oh, let's forget about Clark.

209
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,935
Let's go on to happier things.

210
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,605
Why don't you tell me
about your lovely wedding.

211
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,368
There was something that we wanted
to tell you about the wedding.

212
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,738
It's going to be a small ceremony.

213
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,515
Tiny.

214
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,314
We're not even sure
why we're having it.

215
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,046
It's actually going to be just family.

216
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,956
Oh, wait.

217
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,263
You two think of me as family?

218
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:26,962
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

219
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:31,608
Do you want me to sing
"Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?

220
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,007
How can you say that?
The Mets have no closer.

221
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:40,342
- What about Benitez?
- What about game one of the series?

222
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,951
- What about shut up?
- You shut up.

223
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,756
I love arguing with her.

224
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,752
- Be right back.
- Okay.

225
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,428
So how's the second-greatest
love affair of the century?

226
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,064
Second? Who's the first?

227
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,430
Me and this muffin.
My God, it's delicious.

228
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,799
How's it going with Joey?

229
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,837
Oh, okay.

230
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,405
Okay?

231
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,409
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.

232
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,782
He's a really great guy, and I know
you really want this to work out...

233
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,849
...but I just don't see this
having a future.

234
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,052
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?

235
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:22,953
Did you just change your mind?

236
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,987
- Kind of.
- Then change it back!

237
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,659
I'm sorry.
It's just, there's no real spark.

238
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,632
Didn't you sleep together?

239
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,164
Yeah.

240
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,031
Tramp.

241
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,276
Does Joey have any idea?

242
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,775
I don't think he does.
You know what?

243
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,607
Maybe you could tell him
I'm not interested...

244
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,680
...in a serious relationship.

245
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,180
You mean, like,
that you're kind of a loner?

246
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,786
Yeah, that'd be great.

247
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:55,684
- And maybe that you're a real stronzo.
- I'm sorry?

248
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,420
I guess Italian isn't one
of the four languages you speak.

249
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,258
- Hey. Want to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

250
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,438
- Okay. See you guys later.
- Bye, guys.

251
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,366
Hey, thank you so much.

252
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,937
Wow.

253
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,842
I guess it wasn't cupid
that brought her here.

254
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,450
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

255
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,651
Yes, yes? How can I help you?

256
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,658
We were just looking around.

257
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,025
Oh, you're fellow scholars.

258
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,666
What exactly were you looking for?

259
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,829
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's
musings...

260
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,440
...on the Smilodon californicus?

261
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,403
Get out of here!

262
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,122
Meeting someone?

263
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,951
Or are you just here to brush up...

264
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,991
...on Merriam's views on evolution?

265
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:09,698
Actually, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

266
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,300
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

267
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,568
I'm sorry. Who are you?

268
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,871
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

269
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,616
Ross Geller? Why do I know that name?
It's a...

270
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:27,984
Wait.

271
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,084
Did you write this?

272
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,358
Yes.

273
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:42,194
You're the person
who checked out my book?

274
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,669
You know, you look nothing
like I would have thought.

275
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,706
You're so young.

276
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,471
Well, I skipped fourth grade.

277
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,853
I am very, very sorry.

278
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,333
- So how was your date?
- Great. We walked around the Village.

279
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,072
We went to this ice-cream place.
Split a milk shake.

280
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,898
Seventy-thirty, but still.

281
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,536
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed and breakfasts.

282
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,939
Really? She said she wants to go?

283
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:34,241
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be
tricky because she's busy at work.

284
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,578
- She said that?
- Yes.

285
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:39,780
Joey, don't you think maybe
it's kind of quick...

286
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,086
...for you to be going away together
on a trip?

287
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:47,561
Not for me. No, I want to spend
as much time with her as I can.

288
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,637
Okay, honey.
Joey, we need to talk, okay?

289
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,239
I got the feeling from her...

290
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:01,774
...that she's not looking
for a serious relationship.

291
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,247
- Where are you getting this?
- She told me.

292
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,346
She said she's kind of a loner.

293
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:19,723
- Joey...
- Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

294
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,525
I'm a loner too, right?

295
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,832
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

296
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:31,771
I promise, next time I will tell them
you're not looking for a relationship.

297
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,371
No, don't do that. Just...

298
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,153
- Next time, make sure she likes me.
- Well, that too.

299
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,319
Joey?

300
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,521
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Finally.

301
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,926
What are we gonna do?

302
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,065
I say we go with "Careless Whisper."

303
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,034
Chandler?

304
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,776
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

305
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,350
Janice, what are you doing here?

306
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,214
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

307
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:23,324
...but I just felt like I really
couldn't be alone tonight.

308
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:32,394
I was just wondering if I could maybe
stay here with you.

309
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,834
Just, I really feel like I need
to be with family.

310
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,778
Our kids are gonna call her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

311
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,044
Please. Because otherwise,
I really don't know what I might do.

312
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:50,180
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

313
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,716
- Do you have any tissues?
- Yeah, in the bathroom.

314
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,089
We'll just let her stay.

315
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,358
No. If we let her stay,
she will stay forever.

316
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,663
- Kind of like your Barcalounger.
- Is that what you're thinking about?

317
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,567
I never stop thinking about it.

318
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:14,111
- What are we going to do?
- Nothing. We'll just have to let her stay.

319
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,644
We can't. We gotta fight!

320
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,640
Fight!

321
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:22,018
Chandler, she has beaten me.

322
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,848
I'm tired, Chandler.

323
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:26,319
So very tired!

324
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,954
Hey, you guys?

325
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:32,094
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

326
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,162
Janice, I'm sorry...

327
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,596
...but you can't stay here tonight.

328
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,239
Why not?

329
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,939
Honestly?

330
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:46,267
Our apartment is a hotbed...

331
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,978
...for electromagnetic activity.

332
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,580
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadly...

333
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,686
...you have not.

334
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm gonna need a comforter.

335
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,796
Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasal.

336
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:14,568
Do you have a cat?
Because it's already happening.

337
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,539
Do you hear that? Listen.

338
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,907
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

339
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,079
Why?

340
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,152
Because Chandler still has
feelings for you.

341
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:33,715
He does?

342
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,717
Say again?

343
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,622
That's right. That's right.

344
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,832
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

345
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,102
And probably why you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

346
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,996
Feelings. Such strong feelings.

347
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,971
I mean, I realize that his feelings
may never completely go away...

348
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,147
...but you can.

349
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,845
Oh, my God.

350
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,555
I understand. I am so sorry.

351
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,120
I'll go.

352
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,695
Goodbye, Monica.

353
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,866
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness with him.

354
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,102
Chandler.

355
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:22,198
You call me when this goes
in the pooper.

356
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,648
I got this section covered.

357
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,752
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in people's eye...

358
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,619
Okay, see you later.

359
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,832
I just wanted
to show Monica your book.
