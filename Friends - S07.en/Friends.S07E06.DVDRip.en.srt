1
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:05,088  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
The reason I asked you to brunch...

2
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:08,365  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
...is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,529  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

4
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:12,488  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:524
I hope it's you.

5
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,490  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I hope it's you.
- Me too.

6
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:18,323  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
First of all,
I love you both so much.

7
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,128  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You're both so important to me.
- Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

8
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,841  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was thinking we could
come up with a system...

9
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,169  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
...where we trade off
being maid of honor.

10
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:31,490  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
- Yes! Oh.

11
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:34,441  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hypothetically.

12
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:35,722  X1:314 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:524
Still.

13
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:40,927  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:524
If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would
be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

14
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,567  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
We all get to do it
and no one gets upset.

15
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:47,926  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's a pretty good idea.
- I'll do that. So, who's yours?

16
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:52,642  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

17
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:57,611  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why is that the best part?
- I don't have to.

18
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:03,768  X1:093 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:524
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

19
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:05,446  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'd like to make a toast.

20
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,608  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:524
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...

21
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:13,326  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
...my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that...

22
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,365  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Really not deciding.
- Fine.

23
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,727  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
Excuse me,
I couldn't help overhearing.

24
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:22,242  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You're marrying Chandler Bing?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:24,762  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
Good luck!

26
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:28,727  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, and good luck to you too!

27
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,004  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
What a nice lady.

28
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:34,609  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
The One With Nap Partners

Yeah!

00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:15,764  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:052 Y2:131

32
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:17,725  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:052 Y2:089
Let's make it a double feature?

33
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,127  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:524

34
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:21,604  X1:268 X2:444 Y1:052 Y2:088
<i>Die Hard 2.</i>

35
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,404  X1:144 X2:569 Y1:052 Y2:093
Joey, this is <i>Die Hard 1</i> again.

36
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:29,652  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:052 Y2:127
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's <i>Die Hard 2.</i>

37
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,327  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Joey, we just saw it.
- And?

38
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,489  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:052 Y2:093
It would be cool to see it again!

39
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,406  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah! <i>Die Hard</i>!
<i>-Die Hard</i>!

40
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:41,924  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:524
Dude, you didn't say <i>Die Hard. </i>

41
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:44,326  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is everything okay?

42
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,128  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:052 Y2:093
Yeah, I just got plans.

43
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:50,530  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:052 Y2:093
Well, John McClane had plans.

44
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:54,325  X1:171 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:131
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up...

45
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,803  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:052 Y2:131
...and starts calling
everybody "bitch."

46
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:00,767  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:052 Y2:093
What are you talking about, bitch?

47
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,172  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey, Rachel.
- Yeah?

48
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:08,763  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

49
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,326  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

50
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:13,725  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God, Phoebe.
I mean I'm just...

51
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,326  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait a minute.

52
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:21,961  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

53
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:23,526  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

54
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:26,924  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, if that's what you want.

55
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,607  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:524
No way, Phoebe.
I want to be Monica's.

56
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:33,964  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Why does it even matter?
- Why does it matter to you?

57
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,323  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:524
Because this one is now.

58
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,242  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
And it's two of our best friends.

59
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:41,848  X1:064 X2:651 Y1:482 Y2:524
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

60
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,890  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?

61
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:49,612  X1:251 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:524
You wouldn't.

62
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:55,332  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this...

63
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,730  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
...but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

64
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,009  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:524
I know you've done it at least twice.

65
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:03,932  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah, but Phoebe...
- Please let me finish.

66
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,131  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
I guess that was it.

67
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,127  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

68
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:14,407  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

69
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,524  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, thank you so much!

70
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,327  X1:314 X2:400 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yay.

71
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,924  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm gonna marry someone good.

72
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:25,802  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, I know.

73
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,532  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:488 Y2:524
Better than Chandler.

74
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,324  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What happened?
- I don't know.

75
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,292  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:524
We fell asleep. That is all.

76
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,882  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

77
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,410  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, well, I'd better go.

78
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:00,490  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I think that would be best.
- Yeah.

79
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,285  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

80
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:05,769  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:524
- But not about this.
- No, never. Never!

81
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,289  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Bye.
- No touch. No touch.

82
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:17,204  X1:085 X2:631 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

83
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:19,847  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:446 Y2:524
This woman overheard that
I was marrying you...

84
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,850  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and she wished me good luck.

85
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:23,242  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's sweet.

86
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:26,251  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, it was more like a "good luck."

87
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,729  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:486 Y2:524
So, what did this woman look like?

88
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,128  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:524
She was, like, 30,
dark hair, attractive.

89
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,565  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
Any chance you were looking into a
bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

90
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,289  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:524
Was it someone you dated in college?

91
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:41,688  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, I only dated two girls
in college...

92
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,164  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:486 Y2:524
...both blond, both not attractive.

93
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,606  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let me check this out.

94
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:50,373  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:524
- What are you doing?
- Well, let's see.

95
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:53,286  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, is that her?

96
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:54,812  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God, yes!

97
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:58,568  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Who is she?
- Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

98
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,285  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you break up with her?

99
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,964  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, we're still together.

100
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:11,170  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

101
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,443  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why?
- She came back the third summer...

102
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:17,123  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
...and she'd gotten really fa...

103
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:22,413  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Fat?
- I did not say fat.

104
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:25,167  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:524
I said fa...

105
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,051  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:524
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

106
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:30,971  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:35,286  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:524
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

108
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,767  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
Apparently she does.

109
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:39,771  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what they say:
"Elephants never forget."

110
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,162  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:524
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

111
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:51,567  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, what's going on?

112
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:53,650  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:488 Y2:524
She's Monica's maid of honor.

113
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:58,051  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

114
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,727  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:488 Y2:524
You have been maid of honor before?

115
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:06,528  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

116
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,329  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's it. I am maid of honor.

117
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,569  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No, I am.
- How come you are?

118
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:14,333  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
Because I cared enough to lie.

119
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,253  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

120
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:18,852  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:488 Y2:524
We could have an audition.

121
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:22,051  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:524
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

122
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:24,369  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What do you mean?
- When I want a job...

123
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:27,650  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see...

124
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:28,649  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:524
...I get the part.

125
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:31,651  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
So, okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

126
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,969  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

127
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,972  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:524
- It's better than us deciding.
- Oh, this is crazy.

128
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:40,649  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Can't we just flip a coin?
- No, coins hate me.

129
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:45,242  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

130
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,327  X1:326 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hi!

131
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,689  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:486 Y2:524
Ross, sweetie.

132
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:54,606  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey there, handsome thing.

133
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:02,245  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

134
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,448  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

135
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:12,605  X1:139 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
Just brought back your videos.

136
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:16,567  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

137
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:18,650  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:486 Y2:524
No. No, we don't.

138
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:20,003  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, we do.

139
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:23,644  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Now, look.
That was the best nap I ever had.

140
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:30,852  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know what
you're talking about.

141
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:32,972  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:486 Y2:524
Come on, admit it.

142
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,164  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
That was the best nap you ever had.

143
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,851  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:488 Y2:524
I've had better.

144
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,251  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. When?

145
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,726  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

146
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:47,372  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:524
I said it, okay?

147
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,450  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:524
But it's over, Joey!

148
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:52,886  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
I want to do it again.

149
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,684  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
We can't do it again.

150
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,248  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why not?
- Because it's weird!

151
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,052  X1:313 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:524
Fine.

152
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,322  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:488 Y2:524
You want a drink?

153
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,923  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Sure. What do you got?
- Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

154
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:18,246  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chandler.

155
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,283  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just figured out who you are.

156
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,643  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:524
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

157
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:27,527  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You're Louis Posen.
- Who?

158
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,847  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

159
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:34,284  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

160
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,648  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you know why?

161
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,926  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

162
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,530  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
No, but because he thought
I was too fa...

163
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,764  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:524
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

164
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,441  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

165
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:54,651  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 16 years ago.

166
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:58,482  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

167
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:02,129  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

168
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,927  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

169
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,687  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, we'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

170
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,202  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
You'll be scored
on a scale of one to ten.

171
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,722  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
- One being the highest.
- Ten is the highest.

172
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:19,084  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Why is 10 the highest?
- Because it's the highest.

173
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,085  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

174
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:26,932  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:524
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

175
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:31,126  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

176
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,489  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't want to marry Chandler.

177
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,849  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I've got cold feet.
- It's gonna be okay.

178
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,362  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

179
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:41,007  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
This means I'll never
get to sleep with Joey.

180
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,329  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:524
Look, Monica...

181
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,564  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
...getting cold feet is very common.

182
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,082  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's just because
of all the anticipation.

183
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,292  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

184
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,927  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

185
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:59,482  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:524
You don't get to keep the gifts.

186
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:02,483  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Drawing on your own experience.

187
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:03,887  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Very good.

188
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,323  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

189
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,727  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you, judges.

190
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,889  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Kiss ass.
- Oh.

191
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,888  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Okay, Phoebe.
- Yes, Your Honor.

192
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:16,571  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're now in the ceremony.

193
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,729  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
Monica is about to say, "I do"...

194
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:21,203  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
...when her drunk uncle
starts yelling.

195
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:22,727  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
What do you do? Go!

196
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,441  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
When Monica was a little girl...

197
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,484  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:524
...I remember that...

198
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:31,612  X1:318 X2:398 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ow!

199
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:33,206  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Very good!
- Oh.

200
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,730  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

201
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:39,204  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

202
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:42,092  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
Hey, you want
a little taste of Pheebs?

203
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:47,330  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

204
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,966  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
We haven't even prepared...

205
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,403  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Go!
- Okay, okay, okay.

206
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,922  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as...

207
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:59,411  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it.

208
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:04,408  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
I met... I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds...

209
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:09,323  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25...

210
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,803  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
...although he seemed
like a 6-year-old.

211
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:13,971  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

212
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,803  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you. Thank you very much.

213
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:21,247  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:524
I've known them
separately and together.

214
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:26,408  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are in the presence of love.

215
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:29,810  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
So I would like to raise my glass...

216
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,605  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:524
...to Monica and Chandler...

217
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:36,125  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

218
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:39,843  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

219
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,172  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow.

220
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,603  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Great speech.
- Yeah, it really was.

221
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:46,802  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, thanks.

222
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:51,763  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

223
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,208  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

224
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:01,603  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

225
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,281  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel...

226
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,212  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
...while we were
showering together, naked.

227
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,404  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
And she's back in the game!

228
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:26,802  X1:279 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:524
Julie. Hi.

229
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,163  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
Chandler Bing.
I guess you remember me.

230
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:31,404  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:486 Y2:524
Hello, Skidmark.

231
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,403  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

232
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,406  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's pretty clear.

233
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:44,443  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
I owe you a long, overdue apology.

234
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:47,963  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:524
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because of your weight.

235
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,604  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's why you broke up with me?

236
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,804  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:488 Y2:524
You didn't know that?

237
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,923  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, I guess my work here is done.

238
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:09,123  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
First of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

239
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:10,852  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
You should be proud.

240
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:15,644  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
And I'd also like to say, in this
competition, there are no losers.

241
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,088  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

242
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,171  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? I won.

243
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,206  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What?
- I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

244
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,962  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Well, then I demand a recount!
- Actually, it wasn't that close.

245
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:31,131  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

246
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,489  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

247
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:35,241  X1:300 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:524
Heads.

248
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,607  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
What? The coins have
finally forgiven me!

249
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,249  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
Know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her...

250
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:49,328  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:524
...vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

251
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:54,131  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

252
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:59,922  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:524
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

253
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,248  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

254
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:05,526  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:446 Y2:524
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

255
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,922  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why would I care about that?

256
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:15,125  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
No reason. I'm just saying that...

257
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:17,526  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:524
...that's where I'll be.

258
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:40,207  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

259
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:44,565  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

260
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,247  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

261
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:51,406  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
- I'd love it if I could do both.

262
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:57,125  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, I have to ask.

263
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,562  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

264
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:02,008  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
Will you break up with me
if I get fat?

265
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,328  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

266
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:06,684  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

267
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:09,123  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

268
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:11,721  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:524
In one year?

269
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:14,089  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
My God, what did she eat?
Her family?

270
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,051  X1:208 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's not the point.

271
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:22,041  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
I know it was a stupid reason to
break up with someone, but I was 15.

272
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:26,292  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

273
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,611  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

274
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:31,882  X1:224 X2:490 Y1:488 Y2:524
You called me fat.

275
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,202  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait a minute.

276
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,927  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:524
- That was totally different.
- How?

277
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:39,762  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

278
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:44,364  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

279
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:47,007  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

280
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:51,001  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

281
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:58,243  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is one of the things that
I can apologize for later.

282
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,163  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
What I mean is, you're Monica.

283
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:05,331  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

284
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,082  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:524
Keep going.

285
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:11,172  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down...

286
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,290  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and I will still love you.

287
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:17,930  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:524
Even if I were to shrink down
to 2 inches tall?

288
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:20,849  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

289
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,282  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:484 Y2:524
I love you.

290
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:29,326  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
Skidmark still got a way
with the ladies.

291
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:33,202  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:486 Y2:524
Hi, Pheebs.

292
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:34,766  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,571  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just want to apologize.

294
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:39,088  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

295
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:42,683  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

296
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,249  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, you mean today. Yeah.

297
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:51,529  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, and you know,
you deserve to win.

298
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,531  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
And I was thinking about it.

299
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,765  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

300
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,964  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

301
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:04,408  X1:074 X2:642 Y1:446 Y2:524
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

302
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:07,411  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Just in case.
- Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

303
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:10,764  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

304
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:13,083  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

305
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,922  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
Here's a picture from one Halloween
when she dressed up as a bride.

306
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,691  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
She made me carry her train...

307
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:21,885  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
...which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

308
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:26,127  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, and here's
a little purse that I found.

309
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,052  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

310
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:31,813  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh.
- Something. And...

311
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:36,370  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
...vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

312
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:38,922  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

313
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:42,288  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:524
This stuff is great.

314
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,723  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
I forgot this was in here.

315
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:50,563  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

316
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:54,328  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed."

317
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,241  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
And it's blue.

318
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:05,329  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

319
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,726  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
You do?

320
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:12,730  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Why?
- Because I think it means more to you.

321
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:15,763  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

322
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:18,004  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's fine.
I mean, this is something...

323
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:21,728  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
...that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 14?

324
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:24,931  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, I was 10.
I just developed early.

325
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,604  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:524
Man alive!

326
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,125  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey!

327
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,291  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

328
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,929  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, that's great!

329
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:41,370  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

330
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,569  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
I have really specific ideas.

331
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,769  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:524
We should meet four times a week.

332
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,726  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

333
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:52,530  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:524
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

334
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,329  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

335
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:03,972  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:524
She's gonna be yours.

336
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,252  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:484 Y2:524
Great nap.

337
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,284  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:524
It really was.

338
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,485  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:052 Y2:093
What the hell are you doing?

339
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:44,812  X1:312 X2:402 Y1:052 Y2:088
God!

340
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:52,406  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:052 Y2:088
Excuse me.
