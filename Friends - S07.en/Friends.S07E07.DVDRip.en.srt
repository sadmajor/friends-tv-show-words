00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:05,204  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Morning.
- Hi.

2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:07,131  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:524
How was your date?

3
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:09,608  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Pretty good.
- Oh, good.

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,922  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
My God. Sorry about that.

5
00:00:15,372 --> 00:00:17,010  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, really good.

6
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:18,971  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:524
I gotta go. I'm late.

7
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:21,163  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:524
You're going to leave
her with me?

8
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:23,328  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't worry,
she's a terrific girl.

9
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:24,846  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you do me a favor?

10
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:29,404  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:524
Could you mention I'm not looking
for a relationship? That'd be great.

11
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,364  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:524
What, are you kidding?

12
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:34,848  X1:122 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just casually slip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

13
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:38,209  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:524
Tell her I'm a loner.
No, an outlaw.

14
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:41,410  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:524
She doesn't want to get mixed up
with the likes of me.

15
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:42,931  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's a lot to remember.

16
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:45,163  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?

17
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:48,042  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm gonna call her later myself.

18
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:49,441  X1:294 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:524
Honest.

19
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:52,604  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
Chandler used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

20
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,412  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:450 Y2:524
He'd make extras
and leave them for me.

21
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:59,009  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not telling her anything.
It's not my responsibility.

22
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:00,406  X1:313 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:524
Fine.

23
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:03,961  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
Now, where did we land
on those pancakes?

24
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,807  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi.

25
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:12,084  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
Sorry, but I couldn't get
that lock to work.

26
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:15,250  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
when I moved in.

27
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:18,486  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
- Hi.

28
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:23,484  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:524
I don't mean this to sound like high
school, but did he talk about me?

29
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,651  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
Would you like some pancakes?

30
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,328  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
The One with Ross's Library Book

00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:32,521  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:450 Y2:524

32
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:12,201  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Come on. Why are we here?
- Okay, okay, take a guess.

33
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:15,051  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
The hot chicks?

34
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:19,526  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:052 Y2:131
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the library computer earlier...

35
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,887  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:052 Y2:093
...you know, for fun.

36
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:24,211  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:052 Y2:131
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up?

37
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:26,204  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:052 Y2:093
My doctoral dissertation.

38
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:30,331  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:052 Y2:132
It's right down here in the biggest
library in the university.

39
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:32,130  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:052 Y2:094
Wow, that's actually pretty cool.

40
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:37,605  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:052 Y2:132
There's also a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

41
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:42,000  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:052 Y2:088
What is that?

42
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:46,601  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:052 Y2:131
Sounds like two people are really
enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

43
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,402  X1:242 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're so sorry.

44
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:59,206  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

45
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:07,244  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
She sent the chicken back again?

46
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:11,411  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:524
She said it's too dry and wants
to explain to you how she wants it.

47
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:13,847  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'd like to meet this chicken expert.

48
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:15,764  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:488 Y2:524
Send the colonel in.

49
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:24,205  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

50
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:27,605  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Lucky bastard.

51
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:31,043  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Janice.
- How are you...

52
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:36,167  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:524
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

53
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,405  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm fine.

54
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:43,922  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm blind.

55
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,086  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
So who's the lucky guy?

56
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:54,126  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

57
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,567  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:524
I am so sorry, sweetie.

58
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,603  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you okay?

59
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,444  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
You didn't tell her we're engaged?

60
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:05,041  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:450 Y2:524
- She saw the ring.
- Did she freak out?

61
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:08,369  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most people.

62
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:12,766  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:524
She actually has a boyfriend herself.

63
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,400  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
Name's Clark.

64
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:17,446  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
She also invited herself
to our wedding.

65
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,011  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:524
Clark too.

66
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:22,320  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
You said no, right?

67
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:28,243  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
You said no, right?

68
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:31,444  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

69
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:33,523  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What was I supposed to do?
- Lie.

70
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:37,122  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
How hard is that?
"Your check's in the mail. "

71
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:39,602  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Oh, your baby's so cute. "

72
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:43,603  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:524
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross. "

73
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,371  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

74
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:52,247  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:524
Think she'll sit quietly?
Think she'll want to make a toast?

75
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,087  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
You don't think she'll want
to sing "Part-Time Lover"?

76
00:04:56,812 --> 00:05:00,407  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:524
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
the chicken either, is she?

77
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:05,249  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know what? Lt'll be okay.

78
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:07,926  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
She's probably not gonna even
want to come.

79
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:11,403  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Really?
- No, that was a lie.

80
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:13,848  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
See how easy that was?

81
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:17,445  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:524
So you would have just lied?

82
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,011  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

83
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:23,001  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:524
- It would have really been that easy?
- Yes.

84
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:26,170  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:524
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and Clark.

85
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:34,241  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, what's up?

86
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:38,642  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, who's your friend?

87
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:42,644  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey, Joey.
- Erin.

88
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:44,920  X1:235 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're still here.

89
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:50,331  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:446 Y2:524
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

90
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:53,205  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.

91
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,647  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
And then there's you guys.

92
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:59,089  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, listen, I better get going.

93
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,611  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:524
Today was great. Thanks.

94
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,407  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:524
And Joey, last night was fun.

95
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,887  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah. I'll call you.

96
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,923  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'll call you too.
- Or I'll call you.

97
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:10,730  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:446 Y2:524
- And call me.
- Okay.

98
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:12,845  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
Good to see you again.

99
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:14,810  X1:283 X2:433 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

100
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:19,404  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
The system kind of broke down, huh?

101
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:23,728  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
tell her all those things.

102
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,650  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
And we got to talking, and l...

103
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:27,769  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
We want you to marry her.

104
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:29,681  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

105
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:32,281  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:484 Y2:524
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

106
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,289  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who do you think brought her here?

107
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:35,806  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:524
Cupid.

108
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,287  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:524
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.

109
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:43,211  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
Man, do you know what guys want.

110
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,603  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

111
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:53,003  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.

112
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,691  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
My beers?!

113
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:58,004  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, she's a very nice girl.

114
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,124  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

115
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:02,685  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:524
You always say that.

116
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:05,645  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it would go somewhere.

117
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:08,525  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't think so.

118
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:10,890  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Whatever.
- Fine.

119
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:13,811  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, don't start judging me.

120
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:15,889  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're in love with your assistant.

121
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:19,689  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're sleeping with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

122
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:21,801  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Phoebe!

123
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,003  X1:258 X2:456 Y1:488 Y2:524
Secret affair.

124
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:36,205  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:446 Y2:524
People are doing it
in front of my book.

125
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:38,448  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry?

126
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:43,124  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
My doctoral dissertation is in the
library at school. I went to see it.

127
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:48,367  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:446 Y2:524
And there were students making babies
right in the paleontology section.

128
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:52,284  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

129
00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:54,606  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
At your school...

130
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:59,727  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:524
...was there a place on campus
where students went to fool around?

131
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,121  X1:232 X2:482 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, there was.

132
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:05,650  X1:089 X2:625 Y1:446 Y2:524
In the corner of the library where all
the books were that nobody ever read.

133
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,883  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, there was.

134
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:12,086  X1:080 X2:635 Y1:446 Y2:524
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.

135
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,931  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hold on a second.

136
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:17,005  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:484 Y2:524
Fifth floor, against that back wall?

137
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,889  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, for crying out loud!

138
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:26,401  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
- So we should go catch our movie.
- What's the rush?

139
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:29,212  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'd like to see the previews.

140
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,605  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:524
The candy.

141
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:36,123  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Oh, hey.
- Well, look who's here.

142
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:37,805  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Erin.

143
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,206  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

144
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:41,926  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

145
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:45,564  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

146
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:49,811  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

147
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,809  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no.

148
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:53,761  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:524
What party?

149
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:55,804  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
A birthday party.

150
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:58,245  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
Whose birthday party?

151
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,608  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
Alison's birthday party.

152
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:04,280  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:488 Y2:524
And how old is Alison?

153
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:05,851  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thirty-two.

154
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:12,400  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

155
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:15,001  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look how that worked out.

156
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:22,250  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:524
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

157
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:27,088  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:524
Do you know the paleontology section,
fifth floor, stack 437?

158
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,045  X1:170 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, yes.
Just give me five minutes.

159
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,204  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

160
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:38,445  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, no, no.

161
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,603  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can I speak to someone in charge?

162
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:45,202  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
How can I help?

163
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:48,722  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
to increase security...

164
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,803  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
...in the paleontology section?

165
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,650  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:524
I wrote a book that's up there.

166
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,122  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
And instead of reading it,
people are... .

167
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:58,364  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, they're rolling around
in front of it.

168
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:02,609  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
We are aware of the problem
you're referring to.

169
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,721  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

170
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:13,281  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't help you.

171
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:15,046  X1:276 X2:438 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, fine.

172
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:18,011  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:524
If I'm the only person
with any appreciation...

173
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:21,887  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:446 Y2:524
...of the sanctity of the written
word, then I'll go defend it myself.

174
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,403  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't you follow me.

175
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:31,930  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How did it go with Erin?
- Unbelievable.

176
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,049  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:488 Y2:524
We had the best time.

177
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:38,647  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:524
- So you're not mad anymore?
- No, no. You guys were totally right.

178
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:41,002  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
This was much better than
the first date.

179
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:43,646  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
It was awkward.
We were both nervous.

180
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:46,804  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Didn't you sleep together?
- Yeah, that calms me down.

181
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:50,649  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:488 Y2:524
And we have so much in common.

182
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:55,807  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
She loves sandwiches, sports.
Although she is a Met fan.

183
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:58,846  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:524
Not an issue now,
but if we had kids... .

184
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,801  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
about having kids.

185
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:06,211  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my Joey.

186
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:08,602  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
Please don't get married before I do.

187
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:18,167  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just cannot believe
that Clark stood me up.

188
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,806  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
He may still show up.

189
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,206  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you, stupid?

190
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:25,802  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:450 Y2:524
- It's been three hours.
- Is that all?

191
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:30,202  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let's go on to happier things.

192
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:32,846  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't you tell me
about your lovely wedding.

193
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:37,648  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
There was something that we wanted
to tell you about the wedding.

194
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:41,009  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's going to be a small ceremony.

195
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:42,810  X1:311 X2:404 Y1:484 Y2:524
Tiny.

196
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:46,605  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're not even sure
why we're having it.

197
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:50,329  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's actually going to be just family.

198
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:54,802  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, wait.

199
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,520  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
You two think of me as family?

200
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:05,209  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:524
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

201
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:09,849  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you want me to sing
"Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?

202
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:15,242  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
How can you say that?
The Mets have no closer.

203
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:18,609  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What about Benitez?
- What about game one of the series?

204
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:21,207  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What about shut up?
- You shut up.

205
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,048  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
I love arguing with her.

206
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,010  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Be right back.
- Okay.

207
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:28,920  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
How's it going with Joey?

208
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:31,009  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, okay.

209
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,571  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay?

210
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:36,606  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.

211
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:41,005  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:524
He's a really great guy, and I know
you really want this to work out...

212
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:44,045  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
...but I just don't see this
having a future.

213
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:49,245  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?

214
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:52,131  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you just change your mind?

215
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:55,206  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Kind of.
- Then change it back!

216
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:59,841  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry.
It's just, there's no real spark.

217
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:01,804  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:524
Didn't you sleep together?

218
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,361  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.

219
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:05,204  X1:298 X2:417 Y1:484 Y2:524
Tramp.

220
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:08,451  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:524
Does Joey have any idea?

221
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,922  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:524
I don't think he does.
You know what?

222
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,811  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
Maybe you could tell him
I'm not interested...

223
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:15,883  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:524
...in a serious relationship.

224
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,402  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
You mean, like,
that you're kind of a loner?

225
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:20,965  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, that'd be great.

226
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,852  X1:095 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:524
And maybe that you're a real <i>stronzo. </i>

227
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:24,848  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:28,601  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:524
I guess Italian isn't one
of the four languages you speak.

229
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,406  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey. Want to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

230
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,610  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay. See you guys later.
- Bye, guys.

231
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,568  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, thank you so much.

232
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:44,081  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow.

233
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:47,005  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:524
I guess it wasn't cupid
that brought her here.

234
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:50,642  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

235
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,852  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes, yes. How can I help you?

236
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:01,810  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:524
We were just looking around.

237
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:04,207  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, you're fellow scholars.

238
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,807  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
What exactly were you looking for?

239
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,009  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:524
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's
musings...

240
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:13,601  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:488 Y2:524
...on the Smilodon californicus?

241
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:17,561  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
Get out of here!

242
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:28,331  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:524
Meeting someone?

243
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:31,126  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:524
Or are you just here to brush up...

244
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,170  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:524
...on Merriam's views on evolution?

245
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:38,843  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:524
Actually, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

246
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,443  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:524
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

247
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,729  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry. Who are you?

248
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,048  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

249
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,807  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:450 Y2:524
Ross Geller? Why do I know that name?
It's a... .

250
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:57,161  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait.

251
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:02,240  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you write this?

252
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:04,525  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

253
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:11,326  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're the person
who checked out my book?

254
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,803  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know, you look nothing
like I would have thought.

255
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:18,845  X1:231 X2:483 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're so young.

256
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:23,601  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, I skipped fourth grade.

257
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:35,006  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
I am very, very sorry.

258
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:47,440  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:446 Y2:524
- So how was your date?
- Great. We walked around the Village.

259
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,206  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
We went to this ice cream place.
Split a milk shake.

260
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,044  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
Seventy-thirty, but still.

261
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:56,687  X1:109 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed and breakfasts.

262
00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:59,087  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? She said she wants to go?

263
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:03,769  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be
tricky, because she's busy at work.

264
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:08,889  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joey, look, honey,
we need to talk, okay?

265
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,123  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
I got the feeling from her...

266
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,604  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:524
...that she's not looking
for a serious relationship.

267
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,160  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Where are you getting this?
- She told me.

268
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:25,202  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:524
She said she's kind of a loner.

269
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,607  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joey...
- Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

270
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,406  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm a loner too, right?

271
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:42,689  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

272
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:47,602  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
I promise, next time I will tell them
you're not looking for a relationship.

273
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,209  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, don't do that. Just... .

274
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:58,004  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Next time, make sure she likes me.
- Well, that too.

275
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,200  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey?

276
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:09,403  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Finally.

277
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,765  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are we gonna do?

278
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,924  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:524
I say we go with "Careless Whisper. "

279
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:21,881  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chandler?

280
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:24,607  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

281
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,203  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Janice, what are you doing here?

282
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:34,125  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

283
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:39,207  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but I just felt like I really
couldn't be alone tonight.

284
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:48,247  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was just wondering if I could maybe
stay here with you.

285
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:51,689  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just, I really feel like I need
to be with family.

286
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:56,604  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
Our kids are gonna call her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

287
00:17:57,172 --> 00:18:01,882  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please. Because otherwise,
I really don't know what I might do.

288
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:06,007  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

289
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:09,611  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You have any tissues?
- Yeah, in the bathroom.

290
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,964  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
We'll just let her stay.

291
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:19,211  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:446 Y2:524
No. If we let her stay,
she will stay forever.

292
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:23,489  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Kind of like your Barcalounger.
- Is that what you're thinking about?

293
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:25,410  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:524
I never stop thinking about it.

294
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,486  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, you guys?

295
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,604  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

296
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:35,644  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:524
Janice, I'm sorry...

297
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:39,089  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
...but you can't stay here tonight.

298
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:40,681  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why not?

299
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:42,405  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:484 Y2:524
Honestly?

300
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:45,724  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
Our apartment is a hotbed...

301
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:48,406  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
...for electromagnetic activity.

302
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:53,050  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:446 Y2:524
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadly...

303
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:56,204  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:524
...you have not.

304
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:03,691  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm gonna need a comforter.

305
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:07,288  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasal.

306
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:14,002  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you have a cat?
Because it's already happening.

307
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:16,005  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you hear that? Listen.

308
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,367  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

309
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:23,527  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why?

310
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,640  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
Because Chandler still has
feelings for you.

311
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,207  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:524
He does?

312
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:35,204  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:524
Say again?

313
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:38,122  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's right. That's right.

314
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:41,290  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:524
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

315
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:44,524  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:524
And probably why you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

316
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:48,409  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
Feelings. Such strong feelings.

317
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:54,402  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
I mean, I realize that his feelings
may never completely go away...

318
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,568  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:524
...but you can.

319
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:00,325  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

320
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:04,042  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
I understand. I am so sorry.

321
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:05,605  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll go.

322
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,211  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
Goodbye, Monica.

00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:16,331  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness with him.

00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:17,521  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chandler.

00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,647  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
You call me when this goes
in the pooper.

327
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:38,605  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:052 Y2:132
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in people's eyes.

328
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:40,490  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:052 Y2:093
Okay, see you later.

329
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,607  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:052 Y2:131
