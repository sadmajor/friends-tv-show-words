1
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:05,611  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:05,852 --> 00:00:08,047  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
I found a note on my door,
"Come to Monica's.

3
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:11,210  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
Bring champagne
and a Three Musketeers bar"?

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,845  X1:217 X2:497 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, I'll take that.

5
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:14,647  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's up?

6
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:18,208  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Monica and I are engaged.
- Oh, my God.

7
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:24,961  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
Congratulations. Where is she?

8
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:27,851  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!

9
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,806  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:524
She's been there for 20 minutes.
You didn't hear?

10
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:34,646  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
I thought it was a kid yelling,
"I'm gay! "

11
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:39,649  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Can I bring her in?
- Let her stay. It's sweet.

12
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:43,647  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm getting married!
I'm gonna be a bride!

13
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:49,369  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, I will not shut up,
because I'm engaged!

14
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:53,446  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, big talk! Why don't you
come here and say that to me?

15
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:56,246  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
My fiancé will kick your ass.

16
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,690  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:484 Y2:524
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.

17
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:05,363  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:524
You get her in, you bolt the door,
I'll be in the closet.

18
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:08,848  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
The One with Monica's Thunder

00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,047  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:052 Y2:093
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

21
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:52,249  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:131
I just want to say that I love
you guys so, so much...

22
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:55,689  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:052 Y2:131
...and thank you for being here
on my special night.

23
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:57,805  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:052 Y2:093
Our special night.

24
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,649  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:052 Y2:132
It just wouldn't be my night...
Our night...

25
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:05,561  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:052 Y2:127
...if you weren't here to celebrate
with me... Us. Damn it!

26
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:09,043  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:052 Y2:132
It's okay,
I want this to be your night too.

27
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:10,885  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:052 Y2:088
To Monica.

28
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,850  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:052 Y2:093
Come on, wait, stop it.

29
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:14,366  X1:232 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, to Monica.

30
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:21,130  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:052 Y2:131
Have you decided on a band for the
wedding, because I'm kind of musical.

31
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:25,288  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
She got engaged a few hours ago,
I doubt she's had time to think...

32
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:28,689  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:052 Y2:131
Speaking of chiming in,
remember burning my apartment?

33
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:32,050  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, you're on your own.

34
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:36,281  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:052 Y2:131
We should get dressed up
and go have champagne at the Plaza.

35
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,765  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:052 Y2:094
I can't stay too long.

36
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:43,288  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:052 Y2:131
I gotta get up early for an audition.
I gotta look good.

37
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:46,046  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm supposed to be playing
a 19-year-old.

38
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:49,121  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

39
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:52,642  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
So when you said get up early,
did you mean 1986?

40
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:56,250  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:052 Y2:094
You guys don't think I look 19?

41
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:01,487  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.

42
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:07,048  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, everybody, let's go.

43
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:12,568  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is my candy bar around here?

44
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,086  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, you ate it all.

45
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:16,283  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:524
I was afraid of that.

46
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:26,685  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what shoes would look great
with this ring?

47
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,524  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:524
Diamond shoes.

48
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:32,728  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're not getting dressed.

49
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:39,125  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:488 Y2:524
Know what I mean?

50
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,567  X1:098 X2:616 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.

51
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:45,364  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's gonna be a wedding.

52
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:47,091  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're gonna be the bride.

53
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:51,331  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:524
200 people are gonna be looking at you
in a clean, white dress.

54
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,645  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let's do it.

55
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:04,605  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.

56
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,560  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're tired,
you had a lot of champagne.

57
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,603  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't worry about it.

58
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:15,842  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.

59
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,080  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know? It's like biology.

60
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,682  X1:087 X2:629 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which is funny, because in high school
I failed biology...

61
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:25,605  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and tonight biology failed me.

62
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:31,531  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
Check it out. I could play this
while the guests are coming in, okay.

63
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:37,167  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>First time I met Chandler</i>
<i>I thought he was gay</i>

64
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:43,327  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>But here I am singing</i>
<i>On his wedding day</i>

65
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,771  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:486 Y2:524
Phoebe, no.

66
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:51,251  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
If you'd let me finish, it goes on
to say that he's probably not gay.

67
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:57,480  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
You guys don't have this problem,
you're made of wood.

68
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:02,804  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, you look great.

69
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,491  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Thanks.

70
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,326  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
You okay over there?

71
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:10,690  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:524
I don't know. You know?
I feel a little... .

72
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,686  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
You know what? Never mind.
I'll be fine.

73
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:20,483  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't worry about it. You're probably
tired, you had a lot of champagne.

74
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,210  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:524
It happens to everybody.

75
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:31,204  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Happy Monica's Night.
- Well, thank you. You too.

76
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:34,489  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can you believe
they are actually getting married?

77
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,650  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, sure,
but I get married all the time.

78
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:43,201  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

79
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,685  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
Do you think we'll ever have that?

80
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,524  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
You mean "we," you and me?

81
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:53,007  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no, no, no.

82
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,402  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
"We," you with someone,
me with someone.

83
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,204  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
Good, you scared me a minute.

84
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,204  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know. Shake it off.

85
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:04,205  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's just because you and l,
we were like a nightmare.

86
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:10,604  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No, but there were some good times.
- Absolutely. Like there was... .

87
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,406  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Surely you can think of something.
- Just give me a minute.

88
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:20,207  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, well, yes.

89
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:23,205  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
I can think of one good thing.

90
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:30,208  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
You were always good at the...

91
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:34,202  X1:295 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:524
...stuff.

92
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,726  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was good at the stuff?

93
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:44,210  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
I really liked your hands.

94
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,010  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
My hands?

95
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:50,571  X1:230 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
Way to go, guys.

96
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,808  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:484 Y2:524
You were really good at the stuff too.

97
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:56,405  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, I know.

98
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,442  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, you know what we never did?

99
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:03,727  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no, not that.

100
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:06,964  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
We never had bonus night.

101
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,605  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:446 Y2:524
- A what?
- You know, bonus night.

102
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:12,487  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
Two people break up, but they
get back together for one night.

103
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:17,250  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
One night, just sex?
No strings attached?

104
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:19,363  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, yeah, we never had that.

105
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,448  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

106
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:29,364  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.

107
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:34,408  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sure it would be amazing...

108
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:37,729  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:524
...but I really don't think
it would be a good idea.

109
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:39,644  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:484 Y2:524
I really...

110
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:42,004  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:484 Y2:524
...really...

111
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:44,210  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:524
...don't.

112
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:00,767  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:524
'Sup?

113
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,690  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:524
'Sup, dude?

114
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:09,132  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me.

115
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:13,482  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
You playing
a little PlayStation, huh?

116
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,805  X1:250 X2:464 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's whack.

117
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:20,605  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
PlayStation is whack.

118
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:25,006  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
'Sup with the whack PlayStation,
'sup?

119
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,606  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:486 Y2:524
Come on, am I 19 or what?

120
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:35,090  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yes, on a scale of one to ten, ten
being the dumbest a person can look...

121
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:37,209  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
...you are definitely 19.

122
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:40,125  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
Come on, really. How old?

123
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:42,800  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
Young. You're a man-child, okay?

124
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:47,927  X1:078 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:524
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And please, please, keep my underwear.

125
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,250  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Thanks.

126
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:02,726  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:524
You've had a lot of sex, right?

127
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:07,444  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:524
When, today?

128
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:12,088  X1:237 X2:477 Y1:486 Y2:524
Some, not a lot.

129
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:17,041  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a...

130
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:19,250  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:488 Y2:524
I was unable to...

131
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:22,649  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
I really wanted to, but I couldn't...

132
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:26,323  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:488 Y2:524
There was an incident.

133
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:30,930  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't worry about that, man.
That happens.

134
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:34,523  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:524
- It's happened to you?
- Yeah, once.

135
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:38,289  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Well, what'd you do?
- I did it anyway.

136
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,892  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:524
Phoebe, come on, let's go.

137
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:46,691  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:524
Come on.

138
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:50,125  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why aren't you dressed yet?

139
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,761  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wrote the best song
for your wedding.

140
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:54,240  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:524
Check this out.

141
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:56,688  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
If you get ready now, you can play.

142
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:57,927  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Really?!
- Yes.

143
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,521  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.

144
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:05,163  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
But if you touch my guitar again, I'll
have to pound on you a little bit.

145
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:08,212  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
Fair enough. Get ready.
I'll get everybody.

146
00:10:08,412 --> 00:10:11,210  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Finally we can start celebrating my...

147
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:17,929  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, apparently I opened
the door to the past.

148
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:25,844  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw...

149
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,641  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can I ask you just a little question?
Why tonight?

150
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:33,287  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
I waited my whole life
to be engaged...

151
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:36,689  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and unlike some,
I only plan on doing this once.

152
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:43,527  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:524
Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I
hoped tonight could just be about that.

153
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:45,450  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
But it is just about that.

154
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:47,961  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:524
Now it's about you
getting back together.

155
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:50,732  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
See, you kind of stole my thunder.

156
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:55,366  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
We did not steal your thunder.
We are not getting back together.

157
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:58,729  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, no, and you know what?
Nobody even saw.

158
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:01,366  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's true.

159
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,407  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:446 Y2:524
- We just kissed.
- It was just a kiss.

160
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:05,846  X1:225 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:524
You guys kissed?!

161
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:09,569  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:524
What does this mean?!

162
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:12,605  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?

163
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:15,729  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thunder being stolen.

164
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:19,368  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Phoebe, it's nothing.
- Let's not make a big deal of this.

165
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,410  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.

166
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:23,926  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

167
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:28,565  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
I cannot believe you guys
are talking about this.

168
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,525  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:524
Problems in the bedroom
are between a man and woman.

169
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:36,881  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right? Now, Chandler
is doing the best he can.

170
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:42,884  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't think that's
what they were talking about.

171
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,689  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
What a great night.
Chandler can't do it, they kissed.

172
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:49,207  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What?
- You guys kissed? This is huge.

173
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:50,447  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, it's not huge.

174
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:53,445  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
People thinking it's huge
has led Monica to believe...

175
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,808  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
...we're stealing her thunder,
which we aren't.

176
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,845  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're still talking about it.

177
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,401  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
That, and Chandler's problem.

178
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,530  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:486 Y2:524
Monica, listen, listen.

179
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:07,247  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
Would you feel better if we stopped
talking about Ross and Rachel?

180
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:09,249  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
- That would be lovely.
- You got it.

181
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:12,325  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Now, I can pass for 19, right?

182
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,405  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes, you can pass for 19.

183
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,045  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Really?
- Yes.

184
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,210  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

185
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:23,207  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
Seriously, no. Okay? You can play
your own age, which is 31.

186
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,804  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm 30!

187
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,288  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:524
Joey, you are not. You're 31.

188
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:34,091  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, crap!

189
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:39,285  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai
tais? Maybe no more for you though.

190
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,329  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
You know, I think I don't feel like
going to the Plaza.

191
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,204  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:486 Y2:524
Monica, this is ridiculous.

192
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:51,401  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't. Especially with you.

193
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,771  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
That is whack.

194
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:10,245  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll play it at the wedding.

195
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,728  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:524
We'll see if they actually
let you play.

196
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:16,202  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
They tell you anything
you want to hear...

197
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:18,044  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:486 Y2:524
...like, "You look 19. "

198
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:21,807  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Then they just take it away,
like, "No, you don't. "

199
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:25,089  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
Monica won't take this away.

200
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,922  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Wouldn't she?
- Would she?

201
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:30,005  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
Would she?

202
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,728  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
You ate my candy bar!

203
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:42,124  X1:266 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
Guess who.

204
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:48,085  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, I just realized we kind of left
some stuff up in the air.

205
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,686  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:488 Y2:524
What did Monica mean:

206
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,968  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:524
"I don't want to talk,"
especially with me?

207
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:55,045  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
Why not especially you and me?
We were both kissing.

208
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:56,447  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
Still thinking about it?

209
00:13:56,692 --> 00:14:00,002  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm serious. What did she mean
by that? "Especially you. "

210
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,089  X1:263 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Who cares?
- I care.

211
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:03,645  X1:262 X2:452 Y1:488 Y2:524
And so do I.

212
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:10,370  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
I have to talk to her.
Will you let me get changed?

213
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,763  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
Am I going to let you watch me?

214
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,041  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

215
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:21,287  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe her.
It's just so typical.

216
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:25,650  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
I know you're upset, but don't forget
there is going to be a wedding.

217
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:29,765  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
You are going to throw the bouquet,
and then a honeymoon.

218
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:33,288  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Maybe in Paris.
- Paris?

219
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:37,929  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:524
We will take a moonlit walk
on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.

220
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:42,087  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:524
Keep talking.

221
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,284  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
We will sprinkle rose petals
on the bed and make love...

222
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:49,531  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:524
...not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.

223
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:52,606  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:484 Y2:524
I love you.

224
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:05,646  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.

225
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:10,446  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's Paris.
Who knows we're here?

226
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,524  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

227
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:19,042  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
You said I could sing at your wedding,
so I need a small deposit.

228
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:23,684  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:524
You know, some good-faith money
to hold the date.

229
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:26,008  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.

230
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:28,841  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, I see.

231
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:32,643  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
They break your heart, don't they?

232
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,611  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:524
You know, I don't really need
their permission.

233
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:39,724  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
You want to sing at their wedding,
sing at their wedding.

234
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,605  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, and if you want to look 19,
then you...

235
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:45,326  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
You got to do something
about your eyes.

236
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:47,250  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's wrong with my eyes?

237
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:50,649  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.

238
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,972  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
Put some tea bags on them
for 15 minutes.

239
00:15:57,172 --> 00:16:00,448  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That'll get rid of my wisdom?
- Maybe 10 minutes for you.

240
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,249  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
Give her the deposit, give her
the ring. I don't care.

241
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:12,768  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:446 Y2:524
What did you mean
when you said...

242
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:15,685  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
...you didn't want to talk to anyone,
especially me?

243
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:20,283  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
What a great apology.
And you accept it. Bye-bye.

244
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:24,922  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, seriously, what was
the "especially me" part about?

245
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:28,647  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
Let's just say it's not the first time
you've stolen my thunder.

246
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:30,844  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, here's a thought... .

247
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,327  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
Monica, what are you talking about?

248
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:37,569  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:524
My sweet 16. You went to third base
with my cousin Charlie.

249
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:39,649  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:488 Y2:524
Third base.

250
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:43,048  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
It was all everybody could talk about.

251
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,086  X1:086 X2:628 Y1:446 Y2:524
The only reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.

252
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:49,606  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:524
We had a caricaturist.

253
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,968  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>Whenever I get married</i>
<i>Guess who won 't be asked to sing</i>

254
00:16:56,212 --> 00:17:00,444  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>Somebody named Geller</i>
<i>And somebody else named Bing</i>

255
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:07,528  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Monica, your sweet 16
was like a million years ago.

256
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:09,404  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yet here you are doing it again.

257
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,842  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want
to steal your stupid thunder.

258
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:14,811  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
Why else would you have
made out with Ross?

259
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,650  X1:291 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Got me.

260
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:21,845  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
It ain't gonna happen.

261
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,523  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:524
It'd be nice if I could
have this night.

262
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,848  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:524
I never wanted any part of your night.

263
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,565  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
No one was supposed to see us.

264
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:33,321  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
Is that why you did it in the secret
hallway, where nobody ever goes?

265
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:36,610  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:524
Rachel, I've been thinking.

266
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:40,964  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.

267
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,248  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm calling it off.

268
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:46,842  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
Way to save your dignity, my man.

269
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:52,603  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:446 Y2:524
Mon, why, why would I ever want
to take away from your night?

270
00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:55,280  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
I don't know, maybe you feel
a little resentful.

271
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,046  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe you thought
you'd get married first.

272
00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,441  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
Maybe you can't stand...

273
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:02,729  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
...that your formerly fat friend
is getting married first.

274
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:07,084  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, wow, that... You know what?
That is so unfair.

275
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:09,288  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
Now I want to steal your thunder.

276
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:12,046  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:524
Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!

277
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:24,643  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe you're gonna have sex
on my engagement night.

278
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,490  X1:187 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, somebody should.

279
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,363  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, if we're gonna do this...

280
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:34,040  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're not.
She's just gonna think we are.

281
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,368  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:524
I see, so everybody wins.

282
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:40,684  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Who is it?
- It's Monica, open up.

283
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:44,248  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:524
Okay, Ross, stop it.
Please, wait a minute.

284
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:49,643  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, you like that, baby?

285
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:54,361  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:524
May we help you?

286
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:59,290  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wanted to say I hope you have sex,
and I hope you get back together.

287
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:02,444  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement...

288
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,847  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.

289
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:08,246  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
How is that ever going to happen?

290
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:11,325  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you want to know why
I was with Ross tonight?

291
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:12,800  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I know why.
- You don't.

292
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:16,049  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, why?
- Because I was sad.

293
00:19:16,652 --> 00:19:17,641  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
What do you mean?

294
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:20,845  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:486 Y2:524
Look, I am so...

295
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:24,249  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
...so happy for you guys.

296
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:28,081  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:524
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.

297
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:29,731  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm not even close.

298
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:32,924  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe I just wanted
to make myself feel better.

299
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:36,090  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
I know that that's dumb,
but you were so depressed...

300
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,687  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
...when Ross got married,
you slept with Chandler.

301
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,848  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't care, she slept with me.

302
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:48,683  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.

303
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:53,244  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry I almost made you
sleep with Ross.

304
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:00,408  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm gonna take off.

305
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,248  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

306
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:06,524  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
And Rachel...

307
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:08,167  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:524
...what can I say?

308
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:10,090  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
You missed your chance.

309
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:15,247  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:524
From now on, the only person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.

315
