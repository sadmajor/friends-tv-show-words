1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,458
Bye-bye.

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,894
I just got us reservations
at Michelle's...

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,130
...and tickets to The Music Man
to celebrate...

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,832
...our first holiday season
as a betrothed couple.

5
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,875
- "Betrothed."
- Betrothed couple.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,145
- Hey!
- Hi!

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,647
Pheebs?

8
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,322
Skull?

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:26,786
Yeah, it's my mom's.

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,426
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,063
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

12
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,663
It belonged to my mom.

13
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,397
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

14
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:40,697
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

15
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,133
And you can put candy in it.

16
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,214
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,447
Licorice?

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,044
Sure.

19
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,846
- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
- That's great!

20
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,523
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
- Nope.

21
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,453
I mean,
I know Susan does every year...

22
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,457
...but I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

23
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:04,924
And maybe I could teach Ben...

24
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,895
...about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

25
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,937
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

26
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:16,969
Hey.

27
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,642
- Did you know he was in there?
- No.

28
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,713
- How long have we been home?
- About half an hour.

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,148
Lovely.

30
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:35,885
The One With The Holiday Armadillo

31
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,661
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, are you gonna...

32
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,364
...change your last name to "Bing"?

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,626
No.

34
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,634
Why not?

35
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,766
"Bing" is weird.

36
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,835
Yeah, I know what you mean. Gellar!

37
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,809
Oh, hey, you guys.

38
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,511
Guess what. My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

39
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,152
So I guess I'll be moving out.

40
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,944
Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,952
Yes, you will be very sad.

42
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,426
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
- You guys are gonna live together again?

43
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,290
- Yeah, why not?
- She's just having so much fun with Joey...

44
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,728
...I just assumed she'd still
be living with him.

45
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,426
Why do you think she's having
so much fun living with Joey?

46
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,799
No reason, except she...

47
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,700
...told me.

48
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,470
Really? She said she didn't want
to live with me?

49
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,303
No. No, she didn't say that.

50
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,039
I think you should talk to Monica now.

51
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,053
Phoebe, don't worry. I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

52
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,778
You're sure?
You're absolutely sure?

53
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,287
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

54
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,514
Oh, probably?

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,054
I don't like that word.

56
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,694
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,696
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself."

58
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,503
You know, "No, the funeral director
probably won't hit on you."

59
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:32,076
"Yeah, that nice couple probably
will adopt you. " Okay, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,346
I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging all my hopes...

61
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,414
...of Rachel and I living together
on "probably."

62
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,151
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

63
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,547
History teaches us nothing.

64
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,649
"Bing" doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

65
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,198
Great, you're home.

66
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,595
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas.

67
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,377
- Drums?
- No, drums!

68
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,620
Hi, could we get
two burritos to go, please?

69
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,352
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
because you don't have to live with it.

70
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,825
We have a reservation under
the name Chandler Bing.

71
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,557
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

72
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,600
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets
to The Music Man at 8.

73
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,465
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

74
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,808
Is this because of the burrito thing?

75
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,437
- You need to give him money.
- Give him money? It was a joke!

76
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:45,145
No. To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

77
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,581
- Everybody wants a payoff.
- All right, calm down, O'Malley.

78
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,717
- I'll slip him some money.
- But you've got to be smooth about it.

79
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,927
Hey, I can be smooth.

80
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,000
We're in a bit of a hurry,
so if you could get us a table...

81
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,794
...a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.

82
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,801
- Of course, sir.
- Okay.

83
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,803
- How'd it go?
- Had the money in the wrong hand.

84
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,218
Hey. You don't feel...

85
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,316
...like you're gonna throw up, do you?
- No.

86
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,385
Well, I do. So let's...

87
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,854
So, Ben, you...

88
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,391
You know what holiday is coming up,
don't you?

89
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,495
Christmas.

90
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,756
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

91
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,228
Christmas Eve.

92
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,004
Yes, but also...

93
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,906
Hanukkah!

94
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,670
See, you're part Jewish,
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

95
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,474
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

96
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,080
Right, but on Hanukkah...

97
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,376
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

98
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,282
See, years and years ago, there were
these people called the Maccabees.

99
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,718
Okay, that's right. Yes...

100
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,087
...but on Hanukkah, we sing:

101
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,634
Okay, it's not a contest.

102
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,639
When is Santa coming?

103
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,208
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

104
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,004
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

105
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,915
No Santa?

106
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,641
Was I bad?

107
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,783
No. Oh, no, no. Hey, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

108
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,150
- Santa's mad at me.
- No, hey, hey, come on.

109
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,689
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

110
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,896
You're his favorite little guy.

111
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,496
So Santa's coming?

112
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,200
Yes!

113
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,002
Santa's coming.

114
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,603
Will he bring me an ant farm?

115
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,596
Will you keep it at Mommy's?

116
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,776
- Okay.
- Then sure!

117
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,406
Maybe this slipping-him-money thing
is not gonna work.

118
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,618
Maybe we should just wait.

119
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,344
You're the one who said you would die
if you didn't see Music Man.

120
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,919
I didn't say "die."

121
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,325
I said "cry."

122
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,491
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

123
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,963
Give him a kind word,
shake his hand and give him the money.

124
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,967
- How do you know so much about this?
- I don't know.

125
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,932
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

126
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,772
We'd be eating our soup right now.

127
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,939
Mustached bastard.

128
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,714
Okay, those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

129
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,484
Excuse me.

130
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,692
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we...?

131
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,646
So you like the drums.

132
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,679
That's great.

133
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,653
You know, I was worried that
they would create maybe...

134
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,790
...an unbearable living situation.

135
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,860
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

136
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,056
Hey, Pheebs,
we already learned a song.

137
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,564
Ready? One, two, three, four.

138
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,166
Tequila!

139
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,431
That's fun.

140
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,012
Here you go.

141
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,213
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

142
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,587
Definitely not easier with coins.

143
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,154
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

144
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,920
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

145
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,996
Here. Now I only owe you 49.50.

146
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,894
Hey, Pheebs...

147
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,731
...if you want to get Joey a Christmas
present that disrupts the entire building...

148
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,906
...why not get him
something more subtle...

149
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,232
...like a wrecking ball...

150
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,912
...or a vial of smallpox
to release in the hallway?

151
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,909
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

152
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,743
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

153
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,284
...and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

154
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,022
- I mean, it is so annoying.
- Yes, thank you.

155
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:22,591
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

156
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,362
Phoebe, you got Joey drums
to annoy Rachel...

157
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,034
...so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

158
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,093
Maybe on some level.

159
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,371
Joey, you know that you could just
not throw the sticks up in the air.

160
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,446
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

161
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,382
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

162
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,987
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is...

163
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,828
Okay, what is it?

164
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,190
It's a...

165
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,729
...tarantula!

166
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,608
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

167
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,810
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

168
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,410
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

169
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,549
What are you talking about?
I love them.

170
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,416
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

171
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,185
And then my cat died.

172
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,295
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

173
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,191
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got...

174
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,534
Oh, isn't that adorable?

175
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,704
Joey is afraid of the tarantula.

176
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,304
He's so adorable.

177
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,634
God, he's just so much fun.

178
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,403
Joey's the best. I'm glad
you're having so much fun here.

179
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,772
Wait a minute.

180
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,139
What's the matter?

181
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,313
Our apartment is ready.

182
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,881
And that makes you angry because...?

183
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,587
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

184
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,425
- Where did you get that?
- Monica and Chandler...

185
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,891
...said that you were having
so much fun here...

186
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:08,624
...and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantula is gonna change that.

187
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,801
Phoebe,
did you get all this stuff for Joey...

188
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,996
...to try and drive me out
of the apartment?

189
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,474
You might as well have just
gotten him a fish.

190
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,905
You know how fish freak me out.

191
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,240
Fish.

192
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,653
But it wouldn't have mattered.
You and I are gonna live together.

193
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,252
We're roommates.
That's the deal.

194
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,979
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

195
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,751
But, okay, if you're having
so much fun over here...

196
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,957
It's so much more fun with you.

197
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,754
- We did have fun, didn't we?
- We had so much fun.

198
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,399
Remember the time we were playing
with the SuperBall...

199
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,900
...and we accidentally threw it through
the window and it broke?

200
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:50,265
I remember paying for the window,
but I don't remember how it broke.

201
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,611
Yeah, stuff like that.

202
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,041
Well, anyway, they say, if we want,
we could see it tonight.

203
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,246
- I would love to.
- Yay, okay!

204
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,282
- Good, good, good.
- Great. All right. Good.

205
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,149
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

206
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,661
Done.

207
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,835
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

208
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,107
No, these are my pants.

209
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,249
Okay.

210
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:36,246
- How can I help you?
- Do you have a Santa outfit left?

211
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,548
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

212
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,249
- Did you try Costume City?
- Yeah, I've tried everywhere.

213
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,918
- Please, please. I mean, I'll pay extra.
- Sorry. But...

214
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,430
...I do have 74 of them
coming back on the 26th.

215
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,660
Okay, look.
Do you have anything Christmas-y?

216
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,341
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

217
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,475
Come on, you gotta have something.

218
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,975
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

219
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,980
I'm a friend of Santa's...

220
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,880
...and he sent me here to wish you...

221
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,090
...a merry Christmas!

222
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,226
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

223
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,762
Santa was unavailable...

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,798
...so close to Christmas.

225
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,203
Come in, have a seat.

226
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,168
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

227
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,339
- Texas?
- That's right, Ben.

228
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,172
I'm Santa's representative...

229
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,078
...for all the Southern states.

230
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,288
And Mexico!

231
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,290
But Santa sent me here...

232
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,994
...to give you these presents, Ben.

233
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,299
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

234
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,339
Wow, thanks!

235
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,877
You're welcome, Ben.

236
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,312
Merry Christmas.

237
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,317
And happy Hanukkah!

238
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,692
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

239
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,120
You are? Me too.

240
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,767
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

241
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,832
You want to wander in the hall?

242
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,536
Hey, Ben!

243
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,836
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

244
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,412
...told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

245
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,548
Cool!

246
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,318
Come on, Ben.

247
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,752
Years and years ago...

248
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,117
...there were these people called...

249
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,361
...the Maccabees!
- Ho, ho, ho!

250
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,290
Merry Christmas!

251
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,761
- Santa!
- Hey!

252
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,198
What are you doing here, Santa?

253
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,743
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy Ben.

254
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,073
What are you doing here...

255
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,944
...Weird Turtle Man?

256
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,449
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

257
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,850
...your part-Jewish friend.

258
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,955
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

259
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,960
Remember?

260
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,299
What?

261
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,229
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

262
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,997
You bet I did, Ben.

263
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,176
Put her there.

264
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:54,149
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

265
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,089
Ho, ho, ho!

266
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,190
Ben, why don't you come open
more presents.

267
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,987
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

268
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,131
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

269
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,164
What are you doing?

270
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,837
You called everyone and said you were
having trouble finding a Santa costume...

271
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,098
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

272
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,674
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

273
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,273
- Why?
- Because...

274
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,174
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

275
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,643
...and you're wrecking it.

276
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,717
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

277
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,451
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

278
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,556
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

279
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,590
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

280
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,633
Santa? Really?

281
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,501
Yeah, is that okay?

282
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,201
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

283
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,574
- No.
- Then it's okay!

284
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,852
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

285
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,519
Say goodbye.

286
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,222
No, why does he have to go?

287
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,551
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

288
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,587
...Armadillo...

289
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,997
...are ever in the same room
for too long...

290
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,169
...the universe will implode!

291
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,968
Merry Christmas!

292
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,005
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

293
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,940
Fine, I give up. Santa...

294
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,583
Santa can stay!

295
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,420
Well, I'll stay...

296
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:41,023
...but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

297
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,258
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

298
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,554
...and learn about Hanukkah?

299
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,790
Okay, Santa.

300
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,191
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

301
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,403
All right, it's time...

302
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,766
...for the story of Hanukkah.

303
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,001
Years and years ago...

304
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,873
...there were these people
called the Maccabees!

305
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,380
Merry Christmas!

306
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,193
Oh, wow, look at this place!

307
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,390
Oh, this is terrible.

308
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,965
They've made so many changes...

309
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,366
...I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

310
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,974
Oh, new sconces!

311
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,603
- Oh, my God!
- What?

312
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,679
Okay, remember how you told me that
your grandmother put up that wall...

313
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,973
...to make that into two bedrooms?
- Yeah.

314
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,377
And that the landlord
might find out...

315
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,621
...and then tear it down?
- Yeah?

316
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,687
Do you really not know
where I'm going with this?

317
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,392
No, of course I do. What?

318
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,731
It left. It's one huge room.

319
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,933
Oh, no!

320
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,927
Wow!

321
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,838
See?

322
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,606
I guess we'll just have to
put the wall back up.

323
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:08,904
- You can't, because of the new skylight.
- There's a skylight?

324
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,312
Wow!

325
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,785
So, what should we do? Should
we start looking for a new place?

326
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,618
You know, I'm sensing...

327
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,555
...that my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

328
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,422
Oh, yeah?

329
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,189
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

330
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,727
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah.

331
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,702
Pheebs, is your grandmother maybe
saying that you should live here alone?

332
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,001
You heard it too? You have the gift.

333
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,644
Phoebe, it's okay.

334
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,712
I like living with Joey.

335
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,311
- Are you sure?
- Please. I hate packing...

336
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,850
...it's closer to work.

337
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,918
And we do have fun.

338
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,457
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

339
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,126
- Oh, me too.
- I know.

340
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,993
Oh, wait. Did you hear that?

341
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,633
Listen. I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

342
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,405
She said that since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

343
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,631
...you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

344
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,271
No, I do not hear that.

345
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,545
Oh, no, wait a minute. Oh, okay.

346
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,619
She didn't say "chair," she said "share." You
should share the one-bedroom apartment.

347
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,221
Oh, the purple chair.
No, yeah, I heard that.

348
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,129
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

349
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,027
...that should have lasted
just one day, burned for...

350
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,099
- Eight whole days.
- That's right.

351
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:42,069
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

352
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,106
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

353
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,475
My favorite part...

354
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,909
...was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

355
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,416
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

356
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,018
Why is Santa kissing Aunt Monica?

357
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:07,857
Because Aunt Monica
was very, very good this year.

358
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,900
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

359
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,935
...the Hanukkah candles!

360
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,808
Hey.

361
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,050
Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

362
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,252
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

363
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,660
I understand why Superman is here...

364
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:44,302
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

365
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,609
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

366
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,608
Is it back in the cage?

367
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,679
It's back in the cage.

368
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,574
Is the cage closed?

369
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,916
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby!
