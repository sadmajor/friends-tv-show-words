1
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,100
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,532
I found a note on my door,
"Come to Monica's.

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,675
Bring champagne
and a Three Musketeers bar."

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,343
Yeah, I'll take that.

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,137
What's up?

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,646
- Monica and I are engaged.
- Oh, my God.

7
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,420
Congratulations. Where is she?

8
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,284
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!

9
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,288
She's been there for 20 minutes.
You didn't hear?

10
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,158
I thought it was a kid yelling,
"I'm gay!"

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,765
No, that guy moved.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,167
- Can I bring her in?
- Let her stay. It's sweet.

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,171
I'm getting married!
I'm gonna be a bride!

14
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:51,880
No, I will not shut up,
because I'm engaged!

15
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,952
Oh, big talk! Why don't you
come here and say that to me?

16
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,747
My fiancé will kick your ass.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,224
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.

18
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,926
You get her in, you bolt the door,
I'll be in the closet.

19
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:13,372
The One with Monica's Thunder

20
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,032
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

21
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:54,243
I just want to say that I love
you guys so, so much...

22
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,642
...and thank you for being here
on my special night.

23
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,749
Our special night.

24
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,615
It just wouldn't be my night...
Our night...

25
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,553
...if you weren't here to celebrate
with me... Us. Damn it!

26
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:11,058
It's okay,
I want this to be your night too.

27
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,863
To Monica.

28
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,895
Come on, wait, stop it.

29
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,361
Okay, to Monica.

30
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,136
Have you decided on a band for the
wedding? Because I'm kind of musical.

31
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,276
She got engaged a few hours ago,
I doubt she's had time to think...

32
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,677
Speaking of chiming in, remember the
time you burned down my apartment?

33
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,046
Yeah, you're on your own.

34
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,279
We should get dressed up
and go have champagne at the Plaza.

35
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,783
I can't stay too long.

36
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,292
I gotta get up early for an audition.
I gotta look good.

37
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,056
I'm supposed to be playing
a 19-year-old.

38
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,135
What?

39
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,669
So when you said get up early,
did you mean 1986?

40
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,270
You guys don't think I look 19?

41
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,512
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.

42
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,021
Okay, everybody, let's go.

43
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,593
Is my candy bar around here?

44
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,124
No, you ate it all.

45
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,330
I was afraid of that.

46
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,734
You know what shoes would look great
with this ring?

47
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,532
Diamond shoes.

48
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,779
You're not getting dressed.

49
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,183
Know what I mean?

50
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,621
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.

51
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,382
There's gonna be a wedding.

52
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,127
You're gonna be the bride.

53
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,355
200 people are gonna be looking at you
in a clean, white dress.

54
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,699
Let's do it.

55
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,569
So are you the fairest one of all?

56
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,369
- I can still play 19, right?
- Yeah, but you gotta dress younger.

57
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,083
If you wear the right clothes,
you can look any age.

58
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,148
- Really?
- Yeah. I work in fashion...

59
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,184
...and fashion is all about youth.

60
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,946
Fashion is about me?

61
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,718
About youth. Youth!
Listen up, grandpa.

62
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,165
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.

63
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,107
You're tired,
you had a lot of champagne.

64
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,139
Don't worry about it.

65
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,343
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.

66
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,651
You know? It's like biology.

67
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,219
Which is funny, because in high school
I failed biology...

68
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,151
...and tonight biology failed me.

69
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,030
Check it out. I could play this
while the guests are coming in. Okay.

70
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,763
Twelve years old and addicted to pork

71
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,804
No one thought Monica would marry

72
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,808
She knew her way
Around a knife and a fork

73
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,536
Phoebe, that's great, but...

74
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,342
So you're not convinced. That's all
right because I got another one.

75
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:24,752
First time I met Chandler
I thought he was gay

76
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,927
But here I am singing
On his wedding day

77
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,397
Phoebe, no.

78
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,894
If you'd let me finish, it goes on
to say that he's probably not gay.

79
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:45,140
You guys don't have this problem,
you're made of wood.

80
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,475
Hey, you look great.

81
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,116
Thanks.

82
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,979
You okay over there?

83
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,290
I don't know. You know?
I feel a little...

84
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,293
You know what? Never mind.
I'll be fine.

85
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:08,124
Don't worry about it. You're probably
tired, you had a lot of champagne.

86
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,863
It happens to everybody.

87
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,841
- Happy Monica's Night.
- Well, thank you. You too.

88
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,170
Can you believe
they are actually getting married?

89
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,282
Well, sure,
but I get married all the time.

90
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,853
- You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

91
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,320
Do you think we'll ever have that?

92
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,157
You mean "we," you and me?

93
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,662
Oh, no, no, no.

94
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,060
"We," you with someone,
me with someone.

95
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,894
Good, you scared me a minute.

96
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,866
I know. Shake it off.

97
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,935
It's just because you and I,
we were like a nightmare.

98
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:58,279
- No, but there were some good times.
- Absolutely. Like, there was...

99
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:04,086
- Surely you can think of something.
- Just give me a minute.

100
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,856
Oh, well, yes.

101
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,857
I can think of one good thing.

102
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,901
You were always good at the...

103
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,900
...stuff.

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,474
I was good at the stuff?

105
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,876
I really liked your hands.

106
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,709
My hands?

107
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,220
Way to go, guys.

108
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,484
You were really good at the stuff too.

109
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,093
Oh, I know.

110
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,231
What are you thinking about?

111
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,495
Just some stuff.

112
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,397
Hey, you know what we never did?

113
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:57,731
Oh, no, not that.

114
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,973
We never had a bonus night.

115
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,647
- A what?
- You know, a bonus night.

116
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,478
Two people break up, but they
get back together for one night.

117
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:11,217
One night, just sex?
No strings attached?

118
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,392
- Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
- No.

119
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,368
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.

120
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,407
I'm sure it would be amazing...

121
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,768
...but I really don't think
it would be a good idea.

122
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,636
I really...

123
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,038
...really...

124
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,174
...don't.

125
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,791
Well, at least I can
still do some things.

126
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,367
'Sup?

127
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,246
'Sup, dude?

128
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,649
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me.

129
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,014
You playing
a little PlayStation, huh?

130
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,354
That's whack.

131
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,159
PlayStation is whack.

132
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,565
'Sup with the whack PlayStation,
'sup?

133
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,204
Come on, am I 19 or what?

134
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,669
Yes, on a scale of one to ten, ten
being the dumbest a person can look...

135
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,842
...you are definitely 19.

136
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,737
Come on, really. How old?

137
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,349
Young. You're a man-child, okay?

138
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:50,487
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And please, please, keep my underwear.

139
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,781
Thanks.

140
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,327
You've had a lot of sex, right?

141
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,069
When, today?

142
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,669
Some, not a lot.

143
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,607
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a...

144
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,777
I was unable to...

145
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,213
I really wanted to, but I couldn't...

146
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,560
I cannot believe I'm asking advice
from somebody who's wearing that hat.

147
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,731
I had an incident.

148
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,170
Don't worry about that, man.
That happens.

149
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,801
- It's happened to you?
- Yeah, once.

150
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,540
- Well, what'd you do?
- I did it anyway.

151
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,942
Phoebe, come on, let's go.

152
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,750
Come on.

153
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,156
Why aren't you dressed yet?

154
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,824
I wrote the best song
for your wedding.

155
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,288
Check this out.

156
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,721
If you get ready now, you can play.

157
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:06,964
- Really?!
- Yes.

158
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,599
That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.

159
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:14,304
But if you touch my guitar again,
I'll have to pound on you a little bit.

160
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,274
Fair enough. Get ready.
I'll get everybody.

161
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,306
Finally we can start celebrating my...

162
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,975
I'm sorry, apparently I opened
the door to the past.

163
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,559
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw...

164
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,387
Can I ask you just a little question?
Why tonight?

165
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,065
I waited my whole life
to be engaged...

166
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,460
...and unlike some,
I only plan on doing this once.

167
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,309
Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I
hoped tonight could just be about that.

168
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,206
But it is just about that.

169
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,745
Now it's about you
getting back together.

170
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,440
See, you kind of stole my thunder.

171
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:04,083
We did not steal your thunder.
We are not getting back together.

172
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,450
Yeah, no, and you know what?
Nobody even saw.

173
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,121
That's true.

174
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,191
- We just kissed.
- It was just a kiss.

175
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,626
You guys kissed?!

176
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,330
What does this mean?!

177
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,404
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?

178
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,539
Thunder being stolen.

179
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,145
- Phoebe, it's nothing.
- Let's not make a big deal of this.

180
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,143
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.

181
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,678
Oh, my God.

182
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,315
I cannot believe you guys
are talking about this.

183
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,286
Problems in the bedroom
are between a man and a woman.

184
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,689
All right? Now, Chandler
is doing the best he can.

185
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,701
I don't think that's
what they were talking about.

186
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,072
No, but let's talk about it.

187
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,466
What a great night.
Chandler can't do it, they kissed.

188
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,005
- What?
- You guys kissed? This is huge.

189
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,236
No, it's not huge.

190
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,210
People thinking it's huge
has led Monica to believe...

191
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,577
...we're stealing her thunder,
which we aren't.

192
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,610
We're still talking about it.

193
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,187
That and Chandler's problem.

194
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,284
Monica, listen, listen.

195
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:19,030
Would you feel better if we stopped
talking about Ross and Rachel?

196
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,095
- That would be lovely.
- You got it.

197
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,164
Now, I can pass for 19, right?

198
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,237
Yes, you can pass for 19.

199
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,837
- Really?
- Yes.

200
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,035
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

201
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:35,009
Seriously, no. Okay? You can play
your own age, which is 31.

202
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,574
I'm 30!

203
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,087
Joey, you are not. You're 31.

204
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,922
Oh, crap!

205
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,118
So the Plaza. We'll get some mai
tais? Maybe no more for you though.

206
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,160
You know, I think I don't feel like
going to the Plaza.

207
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,064
Monica, this is ridiculous.

208
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,235
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't. Especially with you.

209
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,612
That is whack.

210
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,059
I'll play it at the wedding.

211
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,558
We'll see if they actually
let you play.

212
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,061
They tell you anything
you want to hear...

213
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,926
...like, "You look 19."

214
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,627
Then they just take it away,
like, "No, you don't."

215
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,938
Monica won't take this away.

216
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,770
- Wouldn't she?
- Would she?

217
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,877
Would she?

218
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,774
Would she?

219
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,212
Would she?

220
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,148
It's starting
to sound like "wood cheese."

221
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,820
Man, I could go
for some wood cheese right now.

222
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,259
Guess who.

223
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:05,203
Hey, I just realized we kind of left
some stuff up in the air.

224
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,799
What did Monica mean:

225
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,063
"I don't want to talk,"
especially with me?

226
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,173
Why not especially you and me?
We were both kissing.

227
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,568
Still thinking about it?

228
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:17,111
I'm serious. What did she mean
by that? "Especially you."

229
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,181
- Who cares?
- I care.

230
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,782
And so do I.

231
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,491
I have to talk to her.
Will you let me get changed?

232
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,895
Am I going to let you watch me?

233
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,190
No.

234
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,399
I can't believe her.
It's just so typical.

235
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,765
I know you're upset, but don't forget
there is going to be a wedding.

236
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,876
You are going to throw the bouquet,
and then a honeymoon.

237
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,410
- Maybe in Paris.
- Paris?

238
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:55,016
We will take a moonlit walk
on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.

239
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,190
Keep talking.

240
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,427
We will sprinkle rose petals
on the bed and make love...

241
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:06,688
...not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.

242
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,761
I love you.

243
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,805
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.

244
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,584
It's Paris.
Who knows we're here?

245
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,683
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

246
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,190
You said I could sing at your wedding,
so I need a small deposit.

247
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,789
You know, some good-faith money
to hold the date.

248
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,159
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.

249
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, I see.

250
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,805
They break your heart, don't they?

251
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,772
You know, I don't really need
their permission.

252
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,914
You want to sing at their wedding,
sing at their wedding.

253
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,776
Yeah, and if you want to look 19,
then you...

254
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,453
You got to do something
about your eyes.

255
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,416
What's wrong with my eyes?

256
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,819
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.

257
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,088
Put some tea bags on them
for 15 minutes.

258
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,632
- That'll get rid of my wisdom?
- Maybe 10 minutes for you.

259
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,431
Give her the deposit, give her
the ring. I don't care.

260
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,948
What did you mean
when you said...

261
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,877
...you didn't want to talk to anyone,
especially me?

262
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:37,487
What a great apology.
And you accept. Bye-bye.

263
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:42,089
No, seriously, what was
the "especially me" part about?

264
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,785
Let's just say it's not the first time
you've stolen my thunder.

265
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,025
Hey, here's a thought...

266
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,529
Monica, what are you talking about?

267
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,762
My sweet 16. You went to third base
with my cousin Charlie.

268
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,838
Third base.

269
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,236
It was all everybody could talk about.

270
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,243
The only reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.

271
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,813
We had a caricaturist.

272
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,154
Whenever I get married
Guess who won't be asked to sing

273
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,623
Somebody named Geller
And somebody else named Bing

274
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,733
Monica, your sweet 16
was like a million years ago.

275
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,631
Yet here you are doing it again.

276
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,067
I don't want
to steal your stupid thunder.

277
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,037
Why else would you have
made out with Ross?

278
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,835
Got me.

279
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:39,082
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
It ain't gonna happen.

280
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,720
It'd be nice if I could
have this night.

281
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,047
I never wanted any part of your night.

282
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,757
No one was supposed to see us.

283
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,484
Is that why you did it in the secret
hallway, where nobody ever goes?

284
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,792
Rachel, I've been thinking.

285
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:58,196
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.

286
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,472
I'm calling it off.

287
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,069
Way to save your dignity, my man.

288
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:09,872
Mon, why, why would I ever want
to take away from your night?

289
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,549
I don't know, maybe you feel
a little resentful.

290
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,252
Maybe you thought
you'd get married first.

291
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,681
Maybe you can't stand...

292
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,947
...that your formerly fat friend
is getting married before you.

293
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,323
Oh, wow, that... You know what?
That is so unfair.

294
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,496
Now I want to steal your thunder.

295
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,266
Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!

296
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,941
I can't believe you're gonna have sex
on my engagement night.

297
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,773
Well, somebody should.

298
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,615
Look, if we're gonna do this...

299
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,288
We're not.
She's just gonna think we are.

300
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,616
I see, so everybody wins.

301
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,924
- Who is it?
- It's Monica, open up.

302
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,530
Okay, Ross, stop it.
Please, wait a minute.

303
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,902
Yeah, you like that, baby?

304
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,634
May we help you?

305
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:16,576
I wanted to say I hope you have sex,
and I hope you get back together.

306
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,680
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement...

307
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,113
...I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.

308
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,480
How is that ever going to happen?

309
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,552
Do you want to know why
I was with Ross tonight?

310
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,055
- I know why.
- You don't.

311
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,264
- Okay, why?
- Because I was sad.

312
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:34,899
What do you mean?

313
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,130
Look, I am so...

314
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,533
...so happy for you guys.

315
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,402
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.

316
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,042
I'm not even close.

317
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,248
Maybe I just wanted
to make myself feel better.

318
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,350
I know that that's dumb,
but you were so depressed...

319
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,985
...when Ross got married,
you slept with Chandler.

320
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,115
I don't care, she slept with me.

321
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,927
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.

322
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,524
I'm sorry I almost made you
sleep with Ross.

323
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,706
I'm gonna take off.

324
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,578
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

325
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,872
And Rachel...

326
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,450
...what can I say?

327
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,344
You missed your chance.

328
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:32,555
From now on, the only person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.

329
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,769
We thought Phoebe would leave

330
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,672
But she just stayed and stayed

331
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,107
That's right, I'm here all night

332
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,747
And Chandler will never get...

333
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,452
Hey, here's a dollar.

334
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,347
Consider it a deposit.
Please sing at our wedding.

335
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,284
Thank you.

336
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,452
Now who will perform the ceremony

337
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,597
Who will perform the cer...

338
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,360
I'll pound on him in the morning.
