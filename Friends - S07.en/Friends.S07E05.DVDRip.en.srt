00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,321  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:08,565  X1:072 X2:644 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's the matter?
- Someone on the subway licked my neck!

3
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:10,808  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:524
Willy's still alive!

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,683  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What are you doing?
- My mom called.

5
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:16,008  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're announcing
our engagement in the paper.

6
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:20,325  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:524
- We're looking for a good picture.
- I'm afraid that does not exist.

7
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:22,930  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
There are great pictures of us.

8
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:27,205  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, there are great pictures of you
next to a guy who's going like this... .

9
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:32,725  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

10
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:37,004  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

11
00:00:37,212 --> 00:00:38,361  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:446 Y2:524
MONICA:
Here's a great one.

12
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,611  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Yeah, I'm not in that.
- No, but look at me, all tan.

13
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:46,208  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't you get portraits done
by a professional photographer?

14
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:50,047  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines.

15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,961  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, that's great. Next to that,
Chandler won't look so stupid.

16
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:00,847  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Chandler, what do you say?
- All right, but I'm not going.

17
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,810  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:482 Y2:524
"I'm" going.

18
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:05,608  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
The One With The Engagement Picture

00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:06,841  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:450 Y2:524

20
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,648  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Dude, that reverse lay-up.

21
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,002  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
- And how about those three-pointers?
- Amazing.

22
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:47,966  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:266 Y2:344
And those guys were this close
to letting us play this time too.

23
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:55,167  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:052 Y2:132
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

24
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:59,968  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:052 Y2:127
You call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him "Hums While He Pees. "

25
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:03,569  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:052 Y2:131
Yes, and we call Ross
"Lingers in the Bathroom. "

26
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:07,922  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:524
Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees"
just asked me out.

27
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:12,404  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:052 Y2:131
- I thought that guy was married.
- He's getting divorced.

28
00:02:12,652 --> 00:02:14,244  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:052 Y2:093
Ross, maybe you know him.

29
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,570  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's not a club.

30
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,569  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:052 Y2:132
If he's getting a divorce,
is it a good idea to date him?

31
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:27,330  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
- That's on the napkins at the club.

32
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:32,362  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I gotta go to work.
- You don't have to go for a half-hour.

33
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:35,968  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:052 Y2:131
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during lunch.

34
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:40,171  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:052 Y2:093
I could just spread him on a cracker.

35
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:44,367  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:052 Y2:093
Rach, why would you hire this guy?

36
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:47,370  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:052 Y2:127
- You know you can't date him, right?
- I know that.

37
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:50,410  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:052 Y2:131
We joked that we spend
so much time together...

38
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:52,244  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:052 Y2:089
...he should call me his "work-wife. "

39
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:56,446  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:052 Y2:132
Soon he'll be able to call you "that
lady he knew that got fired. "

40
00:02:57,172 --> 00:03:00,164  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:132
I won't get fired, because
I'm not gonna act on it.

41
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,522  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
You wouldn't mind
if he was dating someone?

42
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:07,169  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.

43
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,766  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:524
Maybe I should open
a divorced men's club.

44
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:13,328  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:486 Y2:524
Dude, that's so sad.

45
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,485  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
I could put a basketball court
in the back.

46
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:18,320  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:524
Could I play?

47
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,646  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

48
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:30,329  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I just did them.
- Well, drop and give me 10 more.

49
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,811  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

50
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,889  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:524
I had a drink with lunch.

51
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:39,563  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Did those cost reports come in?
- I did them last night.

52
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:41,530  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
Could you make me 4 copies?

53
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:43,484  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Sure.
- Great, thank you.

54
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:55,967  X1:314 X2:402 Y1:488 Y2:524
Huh.

55
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:00,761  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

56
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:06,170  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi, Melissa. What's up?

57
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:10,251  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm just about to go out to the store.

58
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:13,012  X1:091 X2:623 Y1:484 Y2:524
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

59
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,885  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:450 Y2:524
Dried fruit and granola,
and stuff like that.

60
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,929  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's up?
- Is Tag here?

61
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,121  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:484 Y2:524
No. Why?

62
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:21,721  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was gonna talk to him about tonight.

63
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:26,050  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
Really? You got a little crush
on Tag there, do ya?

64
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,962  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
We've been flirting back and forth...

65
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:33,051  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but I was hoping tonight it would
turn into something a little more.

66
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:36,164  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.

67
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:43,847  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
But you know, I remember him saying
that he had plans tonight.

68
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,482  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

69
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,283  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, back to work.

70
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:52,161  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

71
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:58,247  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want to be known as the office
bitch, but I'll call your supervisor.

72
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:08,082  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

73
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:11,081  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Now, Chandler, you want to
give us a smile?

74
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,486  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

75
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:19,088  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:524
- I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
- No, I am.

76
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:22,723  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:524
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.

77
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,042  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I do?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:30,687  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
Maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else.

79
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:33,282  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Try looking sexy.
- Okay.

80
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,251  X1:298 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:524
Or not.

81
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,287  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

82
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:52,087  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got an audition down the street,
and I spilled sauce on my shirt.

83
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:56,290  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You got an extra one?
- Yeah, sure.

84
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,087  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Here.

85
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:01,651  X1:303 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:524
Great.

86
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,881  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:524
You got anything that's
not Ralph Lauren?

87
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,370  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

88
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:11,851  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:524
I guess this'll be fine.

89
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:15,243  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing. Why?

90
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,529  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
How would you feel about
taking out Tag? I'll pay.

91
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:23,690  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's gonna take a lot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

92
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:27,930  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

93
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:30,970  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
Really? Because I could kind of
use the money.

94
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,521  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
He's new in town and
he doesn't have any guy friends.

95
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:38,650  X1:092 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd appreciate it.

96
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,929  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Yeah, okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:43,481  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ooh, hey, doughnuts!

98
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,285  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
I know. Let's try a look...

99
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:56,762  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:524
...of far-off wonderment.

100
00:06:57,052 --> 00:07:02,285  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
Gaze into our future and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

101
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:10,849  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:524
Chandler, what is the matter
with your face?

102
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:13,885  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
This picture should say
"Geller and Bing to be married"...

103
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:17,050  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
...not "Local woman saves
drowning moron. "

104
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:18,448  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:486 Y2:524
(LAUGHS)

105
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:22,247  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
Hey, don't laugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.

106
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:25,448  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's it, that's it!
Take it, take it!

107
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,087  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:488 Y2:524
I like this one.

108
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:35,967  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:524
It seems to say, "I love you and
that's why I have to kill you. "

109
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,765  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:524
Can't all be bad.

110
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:43,051  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

111
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:44,407  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
There it is.

112
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:47,843  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

113
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,682  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why did you ever sleep with me?

114
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,286  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
Do you really want to pull
at that thread?

115
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:00,688  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I'm having a good time.
- Me too.

116
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:03,645  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
Sorry that guy on the subway
licked your neck.

117
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:07,242  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

118
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:09,484  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't mean to be presumptuous...

119
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:12,604  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but I have tickets to the
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.

120
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:14,451  X1:287 X2:429 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, l...

121
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:18,731  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, I missed the semifinals,
so I think I would just be lost.

122
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,724  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:524
I know it's lame, but I got
these tickets from my boss...

123
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:25,486  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

124
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,728  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.

125
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:29,885  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's my ex-wife, Whitney.

126
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:32,930  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:446 Y2:524
I cannot deal with her now.
She's crazy.

127
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:34,645  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, I know. Hold on.

128
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,205  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey, Ross.
- Yeah.

129
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:40,650  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife
out there.

130
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:44,367  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you think you could divert her
so we could slip out?

131
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:46,523  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:524
What? No.

132
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:51,451  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, but I have two tickets to
the ballroom-dance finals.

133
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,451  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:486 Y2:524
I don't think so, Pheebs.

134
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:58,085  X1:226 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, I'll do it.

135
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:02,849  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
- But just because you're a friend.
- Okay.

136
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:15,567  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh!

137
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,084  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hi, Ginger.

138
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,850  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:524
I want my key back.

139
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:22,441  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I don't have it.
- It's right there.

140
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:24,851  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Sherlock.

141
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,688  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry, but you'd better go.

142
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:30,924  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just wanted to thank you
for diverting Kyle's ex.

143
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:33,930  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
You're welcome.
We'll talk about it later.

144
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:38,445  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hi, Whitney.
- Hi, Ross.

145
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,048  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you ready for breakfast?
- Yep.

146
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:47,251  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:524
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

147
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:51,523  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
Can you give me a second
while I talk to this woman...

148
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,007  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:524
...who, by the way, did not
spend the night?

149
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,963  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Sure.
- Okay.

150
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,847  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

151
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,565  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
Watching ballroom dancing?

152
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,730  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yes, that's where we realized
we were both super cool people.

153
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:12,806  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, Kyle just told me
some really bad stuff about her.

154
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:13,888  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Like what?

155
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:17,801  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:524
Like she's really mean, and
she's overly critical and...

156
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:22,842  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
She will paint a room a really bright
color without even checking with you.

157
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:25,726  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

158
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:29,090  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:524
And she uses sex as a weapon.

159
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:30,651  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you for warning me.

160
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:35,562  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
At breakfast, I'll be on alert for
room painting and sex weapons.

161
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,286  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You're still gonna go out with her?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:41,841  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, didn't you hear
what I just said?

163
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:44,965  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:524
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

164
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:48,966  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:524
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.

165
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,367  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:524
Listen to me, she is crazy!

166
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,250  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:446 Y2:524
WHITNEY:
Your door isn't soundproof.

167
00:10:57,172 --> 00:11:00,084  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:524
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

168
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:05,924  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Morning.
- Hi, Tag.

169
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:10,489  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Did you have fun with Joey?
- Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

170
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:12,326  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's nice.

171
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:15,968  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
Then we went to a bar, and he
hooked us up with all these women.

172
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,964  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:486 Y2:524
Women? You mean, like old women?

173
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:24,808  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:486 Y2:524
Kind of old, like 30.

174
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:34,124  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:446 Y2:524
I never used to be able
to talk to girls in bars...

175
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:37,444  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but I got like 20 phone numbers
last night.

176
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:41,722  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's great.

177
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:44,321  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joey must have really taught
you some stuff.

178
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:45,601  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
A little.

179
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:48,725  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
How you doing?

180
00:11:55,892 --> 00:12:00,329  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:524
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.

181
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:02,290  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
Now pretend I have a camera.

182
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:06,606  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:444 Y2:524
- You're changing it.
- I can't help it.

183
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,128  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:524
You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?

184
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:12,203  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
Borrow money from me?

185
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:17,843  X1:088 X2:626 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah. Okay, first of all,
you want to make it look spontaneous.

186
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:22,404  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
So here's what I do. I look down,
look down, keep looking down.

187
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:24,011  X1:244 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:524
Then I look up.

188
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:28,125  X1:217 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
See? Now you try.

189
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,449  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.

190
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,648  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why is there jelly on your shoe?

191
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:35,845  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:524
I had a donut.

192
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,285  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hey.

193
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,529  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
So, I heard you had some fun
with Tag last night.

194
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:43,926  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, that guy's all right.

195
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:48,085  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be all "Joey. "

196
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:51,043  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:524
- What?
- You know, all the women.

197
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:54,005  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

198
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:56,607  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's why I never had
any luck with Chandler.

199
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:04,008  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm right here.

200
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:08,410  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
Would you mind just not
going out with him again?

201
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:11,809  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:524
Just the idea of you and he
and all these women...

202
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:14,321  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:524
I know he's my assistant,
and we can't date!

203
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:16,210  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
But it bothers me, all right?

204
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:19,006  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

205
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:22,807  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got a great partner to pick
up girls with. Finally!

206
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:29,008  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm still right here.

207
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:31,245  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you talk to him...

208
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:35,849  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and tell him how unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

209
00:13:36,812 --> 00:13:38,006  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

210
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:42,648  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want him to meet anybody
until I'm over my crush.

211
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:44,041  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:524
I will get over it.

212
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:47,045  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's not like I love him.
It's just physical.

213
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,967  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
I get these crushes all the time.
I had a crush on you at first.

214
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,010  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know. Monica told me.

215
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,808  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
Did you have a crush on me
when we first met?

216
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:00,846  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, sure.

217
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:07,001  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you people not see me?

218
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,451  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you talk to him?

219
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:15,327  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I don't know, Rach.
- I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.

220
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:16,840  X1:314 X2:402 Y1:488 Y2:524
One.

221
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:19,560  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:524
No, 10. You said 10.
You can't take that back.

222
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:28,805  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:488 Y2:524
You wanted to talk to me?

223
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,208  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know.
You got something for me?

224
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:32,965  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, this is from Rachel.

225
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,811  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ten. Okay.

226
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,202  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:524
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

227
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:44,002  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Really?
- Yeah, for you.

228
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:51,882  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey, there you are.
- There I am.

229
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:55,482  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You okay?
- Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.

230
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:57,404  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
So he gave me an antihistamine.

231
00:14:58,092 --> 00:14:59,081  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

232
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,726  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
I fell asleep on the subway
and went to Brooklyn.

233
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:04,361  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:524
Brooklyn is far.

234
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:06,646  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
What were you thinking?

235
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:10,367  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

236
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:14,329  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, see. Look down.

237
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,290  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look down.

238
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:18,490  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look down.

239
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:25,690  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Chandler?
- Yeah?

240
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,482  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi.

241
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:37,571  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

242
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:41,683  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

243
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:45,402  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
FYI, she must have shown Kyle
over 30 paint samples...

244
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,165  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:524
...before she painted that room.

245
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:53,168  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
And his response to each one was,
"I don't give a tiny rat's ass. "

246
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:56,530  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe she should have spent
a little less time decorating...

247
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,967  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and a little more time
in the bedroom.

248
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,881  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't think we are going
to have that problem...

249
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:05,886  X1:120 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:524
...but maybe it's because I am not
emotionally unavailable.

250
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:08,490  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
You think he's
emotionally unavailable?

251
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,683  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:488 Y2:524
I think he can be.

252
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:12,721  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
Maybe he wouldn't be...

253
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,247  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:524
...if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

254
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:18,649  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:524
Excuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her life.

255
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,891  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, she certainly knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.

256
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:26,883  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
I knew you were going
to throw that in my face!

257
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:30,801  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.

258
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:33,287  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
What more do you want?!

259
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,927  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
We want the last 6 years back!

260
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,885  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:524
So do we! So do we!

261
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,488  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry you had to see that.

262
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:50,929  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Morning, Rachel.
- Hi.

263
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:53,242  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, so, what'd you do last night?

264
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,164  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Went out with Joey.
- Yeah?

265
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:58,882  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
Another night of bird-dogging
the <i>chicas</i>?

266
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:02,046  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, we had a really good talk.

267
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:05,841  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't think I'll do
the bar scene anymore.

268
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:08,885  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wow, I did not see that coming.

269
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:11,284  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's just not really who I am.

270
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:15,405  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:524
I've always been happier when...
Why am I telling you this?

271
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:18,001  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You don't care about this stuff.
- Yes, I do.

272
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:22,405  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:446 Y2:524
You were saying,
"I'm happier when I... . "

273
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,091  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:524
When I'm in a relationship.

274
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:26,482  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I love having a girlfriend.
- Really?

275
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,804  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
Someone I can spoil, you know.

276
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,883  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:484 Y2:524
Spoil?

277
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:35,362  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Let me ask you something.
- Uh-huh?

278
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:38,370  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:524
Do you believe there's one perfect
person for everyone?

279
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,889  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm starting to.

280
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:44,730  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:524
And if that person's in your life
you should do something about it?

281
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,490  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes. Hell, yes.

282
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:48,889  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:524
- All right, then, it's settled.
- Okay.

283
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:52,209  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I'm getting back together with my ex.
- I would love to!

284
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:53,881  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

285
00:17:58,092 --> 00:17:59,491  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hello?

286
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:03,489  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh. This is gonna be a while.
Excuse me.

287
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,091  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.

288
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:14,690  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:486 Y2:524
(PHOEBE TAPS SPOON)

289
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,127  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
My God!

290
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:24,129  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

291
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:27,170  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
And speaking of being selfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

292
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,605  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:524
Maybe she wouldn't have to be
selfish in bed...

293
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,485  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
...if someone else knew where
everything was.

294
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:37,327  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, he knows.

295
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:39,085  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:524
For the most part.

296
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:43,640  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.

297
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:45,690  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:488 Y2:524
We kind of need to talk.

298
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,042  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Both of you together?
- What's up?

299
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:52,285  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
to pick up a few things...

300
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:55,131  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and we got to reminiscing.

301
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:56,890  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
KYLE:
We talked most of the night...

302
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:59,401  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and realized the reason
we're angry with each other...

303
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:03,491  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
...is because there are still
feelings there.

304
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,080  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
So... .

305
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:10,164  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, just say it, Kyle!

306
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,526  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're gonna try again.

307
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:18,642  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:450 Y2:524
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

308
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:19,967  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'll work on that.

309
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:22,367  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:524
Right, because you're so
capable of change.

310
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:25,888  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know, he hums when he pees.

311
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:31,890  X1:074 X2:642 Y1:448 Y2:524
- I do know.
- Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

312
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:34,769  X1:242 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're so sorry.

313
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:39,200  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.

314
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,484  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

315
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,690  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, we're gonna go.

316
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,284  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:55,689  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:524
Pheebs, you were right about her.

318
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:59,481  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know, she did try to use
sex as a weapon.

319
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,728  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.

320
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:07,010  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
You know, he hums while he does
other stuff too.

321
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:11,885  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:488 Y2:524
We're better off without them.

322
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:16,725  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:446 Y2:524
Even if they break up again, you better
not let him in your sad men's club.

323
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:20,083  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Divorced men's club.
- Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

324
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:26,921  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:052 Y2:093
Hey, guys, check it out.

325
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:30,482  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:052 Y2:126
- My mom sent me the paper.
- Let's see it.

326
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:35,890  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Oh, yeah, that looks good.
- You make a very attractive couple.

327
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:42,208  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Yeah, we look great together.
- We really do.

328
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,091  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:052 Y2:093
Okay.

329
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:46,728  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:052 Y2:093
Imagine what our kids would look like.

330
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:48,445  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:052 Y2:094
We don't have to imagine.

331
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,011  X1:232 X2:483 Y1:052 Y2:094
I'm marrying her.

332
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,850  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:052 Y2:094
We'll just see.
