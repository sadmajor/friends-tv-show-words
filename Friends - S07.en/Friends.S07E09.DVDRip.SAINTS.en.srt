1
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,969
- I'm ready.
- You sure?

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,799
Let me just straighten out
your helmet there.

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,535
- Thanks, Daddy.
- No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

4
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,980
- All right, it's all yours.
- Okay, okay.

5
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,912
There you go, there you go.

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,918
Wow, Ben's first big-kid's bike.
This is so exciting!

7
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,988
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,592
It was my sixth birthday.
I went to the park...

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,128
...and I got on it, and it bent.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,702
- I never had a bike of my own.
- What?

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,597
We didn't have a lot of money.

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,432
But the girl across the street
had the best bike.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,906
It was pink, and it had rainbow-colored
tassels hanging off the handles...

14
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,010
...and a bell
and this big, white wicker basket...

15
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,080
...with those
plastic daisies stuck on.

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,746
That sounds like my first bike.

17
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,850
My dad gave me his old one.

18
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,051
- Did the girl ever let you ride it?
- No.

19
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,558
But she gave me the box
that it came in.

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,033
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

21
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,363
So I would sit on it, and my stepdad
would drag me around the backyard.

22
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,672
That is so unfair.

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,804
Not really, I got
to drag him around too.

24
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,805
The One With All the Candy

25
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,346
Hey, what are you guys doing?

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,554
Making candy for the neighbors.

27
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:03,988
I'm sorry, who?

28
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,493
I'm gonna hang
a basket on the door.

29
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,525
When the neighbors walk by,
they can take a piece.

30
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,297
- But we don't know the neighbors.
- I do.

31
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,332
There's, let's see,
the guy with the mustache...

32
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,698
...smokes-a-lot lady,
some kids I've seen...

33
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,807
...and a red-haired guy
who does not like to be called Rusty.

34
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,406
Oh, I know that guy.
He also doesn't like it when you say:

35
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,674
"Back off, Howdy Doody. I'm engaged."

36
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,578
You got hit on by Firebeard?

37
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,312
See, this is exactly why
I'm making this candy.

38
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,422
We can get to know our neighbors.

39
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,856
Wouldn't it be easier
if we just moved?

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,489
Good morning!

41
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,996
- Somebody's in a good mood.
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

42
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,034
I have great friends.
I have a wonderful job...

43
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,139
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

44
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,501
It's not a big deal.

45
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,544
We stayed up all night creating a plan
so that us dating won't be a problem.

46
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,440
Oh, yeah? What's the plan?

47
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,846
We... We are not...

48
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,654
...going to let it...

49
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,450
...be a problem.

50
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,330
It took you all night
to come up with that plan?

51
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,930
Well, you know,
we did other stuff too.

52
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,233
Did you two...?

53
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,903
Oh, I don't sleep with guys
on the first date.

54
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,663
- Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise...
- Anymore!

55
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,476
Hi, Tag, I have a conference call
today, is that correct?

56
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,618
- Yes, at 4.
- Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

57
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,220
Wait, wait.

58
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,059
Did you see that?
He had no idea...

59
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,629
...there was something
going on between us.

60
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,604
- I'd better get back to my desk.
- Okay, hard worker.

61
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,477
I'll put that in your evaluation.

62
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,441
- My what?
- You've been here for two months now.

63
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,152
And your boss is required to hand in
a performance evaluation.

64
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:17,049
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaluate.

65
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,630
- Are you serious?
- No, I've just always wanted to do that.

66
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,097
Can you help me clean this up?

67
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,402
- I'm excited to see if anyone ate my candy.
- Me too!

68
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,601
- You don't have to do that.
- Thanks.

69
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,807
The basket is totally empty!
The neighbors ate it all!

70
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,382
Well, either that or...

71
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,019
No. Not even Joey could eat that much.

72
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,816
Little refresher, popcorn shrimp night.

73
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:53,792
Joey!

74
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:56,893
Yeah?

75
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,098
- Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
- That was the plan.

76
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,494
When I got to it,
there was only a few pieces left.

77
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,727
They've come by all day.
They love it.

78
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,464
They love my candy?

79
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,541
- Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
- Hey, Mon.

80
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:16,510
Make some more lasagna too. Something
might have happened to a chunk of it.

81
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,444
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.

82
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,153
Mine stole my newspaper.

83
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,854
It's like a crime wave.

84
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,985
Pheebs, you got a second?

85
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,286
Sure.

86
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,328
Ever since you told me
about that bike...

87
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,658
...I couldn't stop thinking about it.

88
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,393
I mean, everyone should have
a first bike, you know? So...

89
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,804
Oh, my God, Ross!

90
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,874
- You like it?
- I love it!

91
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,274
- Yeah?
- Oh, oh, God...

92
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,416
And I love you.

93
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,217
Not that way.

94
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,012
But the bike got you a lot closer.

95
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,250
Well, take it downstairs.

96
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,321
You know, give it a test drive.

97
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,552
Okay. Oh, my God.

98
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,860
My first bike!

99
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,066
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

100
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,067
You're welcome.

101
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,331
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.

102
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,534
Am not.

103
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,844
Hey, dude, it's okay. It kind of...

104
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,176
...got to me a little too.

105
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,717
I'm just so glad I
could make her happy.

106
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,179
Thanks. I'm glad I'm not alone on this.

107
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,448
- Yeah, you are.
- Yeah, you are.

108
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,453
Who is that?

109
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,696
Don't worry, I'm brave.

110
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,162
I... I am brave.

111
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,328
No, no, no, no!

112
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,732
Can you tell me who is there, please?

113
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,333
My name's Gary. I live upstairs.

114
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,841
- Hi.
- Hi.

115
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,108
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's candy time.

116
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,755
My roommate says they taste
like little drops of heaven.

117
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,785
Oh, please.

118
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,820
Did you hear that?
"Little drops of heaven."

119
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,794
Four a. M.

120
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,155
So can I get some candy?

121
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,459
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up early and go to work.

122
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,064
He does not know
that I am not "some of us."

123
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,436
- He can hear me, can't he?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,044
I'm sorry, but I'll put some out
in the morning.

125
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,476
Okay, I'll swing by later.

126
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,478
You live in this building?

127
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,448
Seems like I'd remember you.

128
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,354
Night, Gar.

129
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,226
Is there anybody in this building
that does not hit on you?

130
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,559
Smokes-a-lot lady.

131
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,232
Oh, wait, that is not true.

132
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,009
So did you read your evaluation yet?

133
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,481
No, it was marked "confidential."

134
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,618
I just sent it to human resources.

135
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,622
Please, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

136
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,659
A joke they would appreciate?

137
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,129
I'm thinking, no.

138
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,999
- What did you say?
- I said you were a good kisser...

139
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:30,335
...and that I liked your
teeny, tiny tushy.

140
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,369
No, not my tushy.

141
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,637
It gets worse.

142
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,882
About your initiative, I wrote:

143
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,277
"He was able to unhook my bra
with minimal supervision."

144
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,921
Under problems with performance,
I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."

145
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,427
And then... And then I drew
a little smiley face.

146
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,690
And then a small pornographic sketch.

147
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,306
That is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

148
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,706
When I heard the story,
I almost cried.

149
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,413
Almost cried, huh?

150
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,876
Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.

151
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,212
Hey, you cry every time
somebody talks about Titanic.

152
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,886
Those two had only each other.

153
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,423
She really likes it, huh?

154
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,094
Oh, yeah. I saw her
walking it down the street.

155
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,231
She had these flowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

156
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,161
I saw her this morning,
walking it by the park.

157
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,970
Wait, she was walking the bike?

158
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,763
Both times?

159
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,101
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Oh, hi!

160
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,972
- Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
- Oh, so much.

161
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:47,516
Pheebs, you do know how
to ride a bike, don't you?

162
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,755
Of course.

163
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,823
Can we see you ride it?

164
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,559
Okay.

165
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,873
See?

166
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,410
I told you not to get
involved with your assistant.

167
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,849
There's no such thing as a secret
when it comes to affairs.

168
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,690
Did you hear that, Chandler?

169
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,756
No such thing.

170
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,988
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

171
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,395
Maybe it's not that bad. They might
not take it the way I meant it.

172
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,162
Absolutely, you know?
Because "tushy" can mean both ass...

173
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,873
...and good worker.

174
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,611
I just gotta get the thing back.

175
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,811
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

176
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,448
Might it have looked
a little like this?

177
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,578
Oh, my God, Joey!

178
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,585
- What is the matter with you?
- God!

179
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,958
This little talent came in handy
before I could afford porn.

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,232
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's
after-hours, but I really need candy.

181
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,472
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
See? Rules are rules.

182
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,541
Please, I have people coming
from out of town today.

183
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,507
- I told them all about your candy.
- You're kidding.

184
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,579
Out-of-towners, huh?
What did you tell them?

185
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,047
I told them your candy
was absolutely indescribable.

186
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:33,053
Some people have said it's "little
drops of heaven. " But whatever.

187
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,457
- Please, can't you help me out?
- Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?

188
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,564
Isn't she the woman who lives
below you and has sex really loud?

189
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,893
All right, I'll do it just this once.

190
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,297
- But you can't tell anyone.
- Please, just give it to me.

191
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,565
Yeah, that's her.

192
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,308
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable!

193
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,876
I can't believe that sign didn't work.

194
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,879
You know what would work?
Stop making candy.

195
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,046
But they like it.

196
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,218
You mean they like you.

197
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,489
Maybe.

198
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,918
Is that why you became a chef,
so people would like you?

199
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,028
You want to talk about getting
people to like you, huh, funny man?

200
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,466
Just remember everything
I taught you, and you'll be fine.

201
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,371
Okay? Here we go.

202
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,409
Ready, set...

203
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,276
Wait, this seat
is really uncomfortable.

204
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,518
Maybe before we start
we should just get another one.

205
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,017
Perhaps like an airplane seat,
or a beanbag chair!

206
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,894
You can't get out of this.
You have to learn how to ride a bike.

207
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,893
Why? Why do I have to learn?

208
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,097
- Well, in case of an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

209
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,569
Well, what if a man comes along
and puts a gun to your head and says:

210
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,332
"You ride this bike or I'll...

211
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,975
I'll shoot you."

212
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,608
I would ring the bell to distract him.

213
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:07,250
Then I would knock the gun away
with a Chinese throwing star.

214
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,480
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

215
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,386
...and, hey, I'll hold you up
and push you. Okay?

216
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,152
You won't let go?

217
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,592
- No.
- You swear?

218
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,026
I swear.

219
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,530
- Okay.
- Come on.

220
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,939
All right, here we go. All right?

221
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,140
- All right.
- All right?

222
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,274
Feel good?
All right, try pedaling.

223
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,503
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take control.

224
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,841
Yes, yes, yes!

225
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,915
Oh, no!

226
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,850
You swore!

227
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,550
- I just thought you were doing so well.
- I am shocked. Shocked!

228
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,399
It's a legitimate learning technique.

229
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,798
Wow.

230
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,147
Hey, there's some people outside
asking about candy.

231
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,646
They'll just have to wait, won't they?
I only got two hands!

232
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,055
- Need some help?
- No, you don't know the system.

233
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,656
I don't need nobody messing
with the system!

234
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:25,361
By the way, the week before your
wedding, you may not see a lot of me.

235
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,270
Oh, hello, liar.

236
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,273
Look, I'm really sorry
I let go of the bike.

237
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,447
I could've been killed, you know.

238
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,081
I know, I know.

239
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,783
But can we please try it again?

240
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,287
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.

241
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,927
Well, I would love to...

242
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,825
...but the bike got stolen
and the police have no suspects.

243
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,267
- Phoebe.
- What?

244
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,973
What the hell?

245
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,470
You know what?

246
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,617
If you won't learn how to ride,
then I'm sorry...

247
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,752
...I have to take it back.
- What? Why?

248
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,185
Because it's...

249
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,288
It'd be like you having this guitar...

250
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,189
...and never playing it.

251
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,193
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.

252
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,435
And this bike wants to be ridden.

253
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,863
And if you don't ride it...

254
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,006
...you're killing its spirit.

255
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,206
The bike...

256
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,705
...is dying.

257
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,851
All right. If you care enough
to make up that load of crap, okay.

258
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,690
Great, great.

259
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,961
You're making the bike very happy.

260
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,390
Okay, Ross.

261
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,996
Please don't die!

262
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,870
To get the evaluation
before they see it...

263
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:20,442
...we gotta get into Zelner's office.
He doesn't get in until 10.

264
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,513
But his assistant, Betty, comes in
early to eat breakfast at her desk.

265
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,811
- That's kind of sad.
- Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.

266
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,814
Which is why I believe I can lure
her away with these chocolates.

267
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,327
While I distract her, you go in.

268
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,858
- Got it.
- Let's roll.

269
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,489
Hello, Rachel. You got a minute?

270
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,963
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

271
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,898
Okay, great.

272
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,661
Abort the plan.

273
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,965
Actually, I'd like to speak
to both of you.

274
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,569
Okay.

275
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,877
Well, can we get you anything,
Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates.

276
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,013
No, thanks,
but I'll give these to Betty.

277
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,516
So I read your evaluation of Tag.

278
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,988
Or to use his full name,
Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?

279
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,788
Is something going on with you two?

280
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,303
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

281
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,373
I mean, what would happen exactly?

282
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,876
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.

283
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,672
I'd have to consult
with the legal department.

284
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:34,009
And your future at the company
would be in jeopardy.

285
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,621
- Well...
- Mr. Zelner...

286
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,381
I filled in that evaluation.

287
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,853
- Oh, no...
- Yeah, yeah.

288
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,025
I thought it would be funny.

289
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,993
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

290
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,025
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor.

291
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,703
And I'm kind of strangely
proud of my butt.

292
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,201
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

293
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,404
What is this drawing?
I can't figure it out.

294
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,775
It's upside down, you gotta...
It doesn't matter.

295
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,517
It's not like I don't have
a sense of humor.

296
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,154
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick
every now and then.

297
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,250
There's a time and a place.

298
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,822
Unless you have a limerick right now.

299
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,929
No? Okay.
Well, you've got my fax number.

300
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,114
I can't believe you did that.
That was sweet.

301
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,944
- Don't worry about it.
- You could've lost your job.

302
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,349
Are you kidding me? With this
cute butt, I'd find work.

303
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,356
Thank you, you're great.

304
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,225
- You know what?
- What?

305
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,191
I feel great.

306
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,595
In fact...

307
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,771
What?

308
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,603
It's just... It took me so long
to get that desk organized.

309
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,605
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,611
There it is.

311
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,152
What is going on?

312
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,625
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy!

313
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,062
Yeah, lady, give us candy!

314
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,567
Joey!

315
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,496
- What's up, buddy?
- What are you doing?

316
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,675
Waiting to get candy.

317
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,901
Get in here.

318
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,343
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

319
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,980
Merry Christmas.

320
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:53,213
The candy is coming! I need
another 15 minutes for it to cool.

321
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,163
All right, everybody, just be quiet.
Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down!

322
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,423
What is the matter with you people?

323
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:06,229
This woman was trying to do a nice
thing for you, and look at her.

324
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,968
She is a mess.

325
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,973
Her hair's not brushed. She's
got dark circles under her eyes...

326
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:17,080
...chocolate on her face,
and she is still stunning.

327
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,116
She was making candy
so she could get to know all of you.

328
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,653
And I'll bet that not one of you
can tell me her name.

329
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,290
Am I right?

330
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,757
Candy Lady?

331
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,260
No, not "Candy Lady."

332
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,363
If we know it, can we have candy?

333
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,130
All right, you know what?

334
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,772
Forget it, you've ruined it.

335
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,941
Go home. You've ruined it.

336
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,771
That's all wrong! You guys
ruined everything. You ruined it!

337
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,586
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

338
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,614
Did you smoke?

339
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,491
No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke
directly into my mouth.

340
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,831
Are you okay?

341
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,502
Fine, but it was
really scary for a while.

342
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,672
Someone slipped a threatening
note under the door!

343
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:18,637
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
Mob mentality or whatever.

344
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,021
I can't believe it. I did it.
I rode a bike!

345
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,259
I never thought I'd be able
to do that. Thank you.

346
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,688
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

347
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,557
You're the one who faced your fears
and ultimately overcame them.

348
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,496
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After School Special.
