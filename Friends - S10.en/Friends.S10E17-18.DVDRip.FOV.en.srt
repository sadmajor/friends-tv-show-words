I didn't eat gold and have a flying
pony

80
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,900
I had a hard life. My mother...

81
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,306
[1x01]has just killed her self. And my
step dad was back in prison.

82

you home.

Next time you see me, if I'm screaming,
don't worry.

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,913
Could I get a three-piece, some
coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?

161
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,626
Diet Coke.

[8x06]Monica, can I talk to you for a
second?

163
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,076
I appreciate the costume.

164
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,200
You did this to him?

165
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,600
I thought he'd love it.

166
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,800
He loves The Velveteen Rabbit.

167
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,996
That rabbit was brown and white.

168
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,000
It was pink, or no bunny at all..

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,704
No bunny at all. Always no bunny at
all!

Keep going, keep going.

I want to take my tongue and...

179

Say it.

Say it!

[2x06]you know which one is our baby.

185
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,548
That one has ducks on his T-shirt and
this one has clowns.

186
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,719
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

187
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,963
Or clowns.

188
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,674
We'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.

189
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,228
All right, call it in the air.

Heads.

191
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,353
Heads, it is.

192
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,791
We have to assign heads to something!

193
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,570
Ducks is heads because ducks have
heads.

194
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,875
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to
your birthday?

195
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,626
[7x12]I'm gonna start to climb down you

Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?

197
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,282
I prefer not to answer. I'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

198
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,800
- It still looks pretty far. - It's not
that far. Just drop.

199
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,990
Do not rush me!

200
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,259
My pants are starting to come down, and
I'm not wearing any underwear.

201
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,400
My ankle! I really hurt my ankle!

202
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,548
I think I twisted it when... A quarter!

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,351
[2x01]Joey's tailor...

204
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,092
...took advantage of me.

205
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,900
No way! I've been going to the guy for
12 years.

206
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,300
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

207
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,348
Then he ran his hand up my leg and then
there was definite...

208
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,127
What?

209
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,399
Cupping

210
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,023
That's how they do pants!

211
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,400
First they go up one side, they move it
over.

212
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,361
Then they go up the other side, move it
back, then they do the rear.

213
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,100
Ross, tell him. Isn't that how a tailor
measures pants?

214
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,594
Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

215
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,100
[1x06]Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm

[10x06]Just happen to have my lable
maker.

[8x07]Oh no ! Was I cleaning in my
sleep again ?

219

Some girl ate Monica!

Shut up! The camera adds ten pounds.

225
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,158
So how many cameras are actually on
you?

Playboys! Ross did!

Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't
break the porch swing, Monica did!

year!

about it, we get married, we're up at

Because I know you will be feeling it
all in here.

Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this
anymore then.

No, I got really hot in my pants so I
took them off.

But they must have shrunk from the
sweat.

I can't get them back on, Joey. I
can't!

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,228
[4x05]God, I love how sexy I am!

318
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
[2x13]You had no right to go out with
him!

319
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,600
- That's the most ridiculous... - You
sold me out!

320
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,926
- I did not!

321
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,000
Would you let me talk!

322
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,594
Did you just flick me?

323
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,852
Well, you wouldn't let me finish and I
was...

324
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,613
Let's not do this!

325
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,990
Happy thoughts!

326
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,386
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

327
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,746
All right. Now, I will let go if you
both stop.

328
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,200
Fine.

329
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,100
There we go.

330
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,316
If we were in prison, you guys would
be, like, my bitches.

331
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,900
====[6x12]====

332
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,800
So do you think that these pictures?
Are, are they trying to tell a story?

333
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,900
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the
case of this young woman,

334
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,400
she has lost her clothes,

335
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,100
so she rides naked on the horse,

336
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,199
she's crying out : "Where are they? ?"

337
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,897
Well, she's not going to find them
lying in the grass like that.

338
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when
you used to go out to the barn, lift up
your shirt, and bend over?

339
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
====[1x17]====

340
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,900
How long have you lived here?

341
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Thanks. I've been here about six years.

342
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,749
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

343
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,747
See, I was supposed to get married,
but...

344
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,114
I left the guy at the altar

345
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,359
Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish,
but...

346
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,504
...hey, that's me!

347
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Monica, what do you do?

348
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,200
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.

349
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,000
Good for you.

350
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,038
Yeah, it is.

351
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,118
Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.

352
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,324
Well, this hummus is great.

353
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,295
God bless the chickpea.

354
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,390
And have I mentioned that back in high
school,I was a cow?

355
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,938
I used to wet my bed.

356
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,900
I use my breasts to get other people's
attention.

357
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,394
We both do that!

358
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,722
[8x01]I can't look at it. Somebody tell
me.

359
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,423
It's negative.

360
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,320
- What? - It's negative.

361
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,700
Well..

362
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,903
..this is just the way it was supposed
to be.

363
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,707
Well then, great.

364
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,355
This is so stupid.

365
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,784
How can I be upset over something I
never had?

366
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,430
It's negative?

367
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,319
No, it's positive.

368
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,431
It's not negative, it's positive.

369
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,222
- Are you sure? - Yeah, I lied before.

370
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,357
- Now you know how you really feel. -
That's a risky little game.

371
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,805
I'm gonna have a baby!

372
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,283
[6x09]I wasn't supposed to put beef in
the trifle!

373
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,864
[2x07]And that, my friend, is what they
call "closure".

374
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,100
[2x04]This is a safe street. This is a
safe building. There's nothing...

375
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,123
Mom, I gotta go! I gotta go!

376
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,845
That's fine, read the Family Circus.

377
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,200
====[4x23]====

378
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,200
I'm bummed the way I left things with
Ross.

379
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,988
I wish I didn't lie about work. He
seemed so mad at me.

380
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,200
Don't be so hard on yourself. If
someone I was still in love with is
getting married...

381
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,241
Still in love with?

382
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,116
I'm not in love with Ross.

383
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,600
I'm not at the wedding, because he's my
ex-boyfriend...

384
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,400
...and that would be uncomfortable.

385
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,026
Not because I'm in love with him. I
like Ross as much as anyone.

386
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,715
Clearly, I have feelings for him, but
they don't mean love.

387
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,638
I mean, do I still have loving feelings
for Ross? Yeah!

388
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,000
But that doesn't mean I'm still in love
with him.

389
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I have sexual feelings for him, but I
do love him.

390
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,077
Oh, my God!

391
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,473
Why didn't you tell me?

392
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,700
====[8x03]====

393
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,041
Right here...

394
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,621
is your baby.

395
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,668
There it is, I see it.

396
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,004
I'll give you two a minute.

397
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,597
Thank you.

398
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,060
Pretty amazing, huh?

399
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,791
I don't see it!

400
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,428
What? What?

401
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,949
I can't see it.

402
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,600
You just said you did.

403
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,100
I know, I lied. I didn't want her to
think I was a terrible mother.

404
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,920
I can't see my own baby !

405
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Come here. Sure you can.

406
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,800
Come here. Look,

407
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,863
it's right there.

408
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,294
Oh, it's beautiful.

409
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,456
I see it now.

410
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,619
- Do you really? - No, I don't see it!

411
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
You see this...

412
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,964
tiny thing that looks like a peanut?

413
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,974
Sweetie, that's it.

414
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,226
That's it?

415
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,022
Well, I saw that.

416
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,328
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

417
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,430
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

418
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,291
Yeah, that's our baby.

419
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,179
[5x24]How you doin' ?

420
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,258
[6x07]How you doin' ?

421
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,345
[4x24]How you doin' ?

422
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,083
[3x02]Could I be wearing any more
clothes ?

423
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,974
[7x11]All right, what are we having?

424
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,041
[8x19]What's not to like? Custard,
good.

425
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,113
Jam, good. Meat, good!

426
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,233
[8x09]Here come the meat sweats.

427
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,636
[7x16]How you doin' ?

428
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,151
[3x08]Ross ? I got a science question.

429
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,513
If the Homo sapiens were, in fact,
"homo" sapiens...

430
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,387
...is that why they're extinct?

431
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,492
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

432
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,104
Hey, I'm not judging.

433
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,600
====[7x19]====

434
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,500
- Joey, this is the awkward part. -
Hey, right. Not a problem.

435
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,000
I totally understand you need to...

436
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,100
...make sure I don't have any horrible
scars or tattoos.

437
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,873
Don't you worry.

438
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,465
I have nothing to hide.

439
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,523
So, there you go. That's me.

440
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,643
One hundred-percent natural.

441
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,929
I tell you, that has never happened
before.

442
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,451
[6x04]So Estelle lined up a bunch of
auditions for me tomorrow.

443
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,643
And I'll have my health insurance back
in no time.

444
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,124
That's great, but shouldn't you be on
the toilet right now?

445
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,773
What¡¯s wrong with you?

446
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,404
Nothing!

447
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Well, I got this blinding pain in my
stomach  when I was lifting weights
before.

448
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Then I passed out and uh,

449
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,701
I haven't been able to stand up since.

450
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,268
But um, I don't think it's anything
serious.

451
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,500
This sounds like a hernia. You have to
go to the doctor!

452
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,400
No way!

453
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,284
if I have to go to the doctor for
anything, It's gonna be for this thing
sticking out of my stomach!

454
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,028
That's a hernia.

455
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,452
Why did I have to start working out
again?

456
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,827
Damn you 15s!

457
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,800
====[10x11]====

458
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,200
Go.

459
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,800
You put this in your coffee...

460
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,500
A spoon !

461
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,600
Your hands ! Your face !

462
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,400
It's white.

463
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,500
Paper ! Snow ! A Ghost !

464
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,900
It's heavy on the milk.

465
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,700
A rock ! A dog ! The earth !

466
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
Pass.

467
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,900
You put this on a sandwich.

468
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,600
Salami ! Anchois ! Jam.

469
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,400
It's white.

470
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,300
Paper ! Snow ! A Ghost !

471
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,600
====[7x08]====

472
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Rach, the big question is, does he like
you?

473
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,383
Because if he doesn't like you, this is
all a moo point.

474
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,307
A "moo" point?

475
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:25,619
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

476
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,947
It just doesn't matter.

477
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,320
It's "moo. "

478
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,900
[2x15]

479
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,074
Oh, God!

480
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,380
Honey?

481
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,257
That's okay.

482
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,525
You just rolled over the juice box.

483
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,794
Thank God!

484
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,422
[8x12]So tell me one of your moves.

485
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,807
So where'd you grow up?

486
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,225
That's your move?

487
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,388
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

488
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,555

Queens.

With my mom. Not so much my dad.

492
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,500
Why not?

493
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,700
I don't know. There's just this
distance.

494
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,600
We both try to pretend it's not there,
but it is.

495
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,100
- It's gotta be rough. - Yeah, it's
really tough.

496
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,586
Sometimes I think...

497

00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,205
You should be. I'm very bendy.

501
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,981
I guess there's nothing left for us to
do but kiss.

502
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,154
You win!

503

00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,600
It's hard after some of the last ten
years

535
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,808
but It's basically like being involved
