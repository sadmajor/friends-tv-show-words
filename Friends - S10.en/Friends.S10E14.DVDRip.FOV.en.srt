Thank you guys for having us over.

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,298
Oh~yeah. This is fun, couple's night.

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,068
Yeah. I don't know why we don't hang
out with married couples more often.

5
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:13,889
Well because every time we do, you make
jokes about swinging and scare them
away.

6
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:19,812
You mean that Portuguese couple. Yeah.
Like you wouldn't have done it.

7
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:24,111
Hey you guys. I have great news.

8
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:26,021
Ross. We're kind of in the middle of
dinner here.

9
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:29,842
Oh well..I already ate but...sure.

10
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:32,325
Guess what happened at work today?

11
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:35,287
A dinosaur died a million years ago.

12
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:39,108
Try 65 million years ago and then try
shee~~

My tenure review board met today and I
hear it's looking really good.

14
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:45,699
Wow~

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,953
Yeah. Do you have idea what this means
in academic circles, huh? I am gonna
get laid.

16
00:00:53,246 --> 00:00:54,869

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,162
Ooh, Italian!

18
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:59,264
No..No one wanted seconds, right?

19
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:01,365
No..I..I am good.

20
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:02,703
Hey you guys.. You're never gonna
believe it.

21
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:06,237
This headhunter called me. I have a
meeting tomorrow with Gucci.

22
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:08,052
Gucci wants me!

23
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:09,103
I am up for tenure.

24
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,586
-Congratulations! -You too. What are
the odds!

25
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:13,115
Oh~

26
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,408
Guess what?

27
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,229
I finally got that seed out of my
teeth.

28
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:21,999
I don't know who I am happiest for?

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,821
I do. He's been working on that all

Hey Mon, was it weird changing your
name to Geller Bing?

33
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:22,884
-No..no. It felt nice to acknowledge
this. -Oh

34
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:24,227
Where did you go to do it?

35
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:30,941
Em..The..the ministry of names..bureau.

36
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:33,722
You never did it!

37
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:37,559
I'm sorry. It's Just the idea of being
an official Bing.

38
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:43,601
Hey! I would have you known
that..ah..who am I kidding.

39
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:47,438
Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing
die with me.

-Here you go. -Thanks!

41
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,138
Honey, would you want me to take your
name?

42
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,303
Oh~it's just... It's up to you. It's
your name. You've got to live with it.

43
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,221
All right, Let's see. Call me Mrs.
Hannigan.

44
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:58,085
Mrs. Hannigan?

45
00:02:58,085 --> 00:03:01,921
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle
of something?

46
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:04,510
Oh I like it.

47
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,470
Hey guys!

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,429
Hey Joe.

49
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:09,594
we've got a couple of things we've got
to check out at the new house. You
wanna come with us?

50
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:11,320
No, thank you.

51
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,486
All right. I know You're not happy
about us moving, but you're the only
one who hasn't seen the house.

52
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,075
Yeah. Come with us, you'll see how
close it's to the city.

53
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:18,801
But no, it's not close.

54
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:22,638
You said it was in escrow.I can't even
find it on the map.

55
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:29,640
Joey, please come. It would mean so
much to us.

56
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:34,723
You know what, you're my friends. I
wanna be supportive. I will come with
you, shotgun!

57
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:36,929
Damn it.

58
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:37,984
-See you guys later. -OK

59
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,820
-I'll pick you up at 11. So glad you're
coming. -All right

60
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,315
Good for you. That was really mature.

61
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:47,384
What? No. The only reason I am going to
their stupid new house,

62
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,589
is so I can point out everything that's
wrong with it, so they don't move.

63
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,604
I am gonna make them stay here.

64
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:55,440
You're a strange kind of grown up.

65
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,989
Joey, you can't make someone do
something they don't wanna do.

66
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,345
Believe me, there's something I've been
trying to get Mike to do in bed and
there's..he is just..

67
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:04,456
O..oh He..hey

68
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:05,990
Can we not talk about that right now?

69
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:09,827
All right. Prude...

70
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:14,239
Look. Monica and Chandler really love
this house. You're not gonna talk them
into staying here.

71
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,500
Hey hey. I can convince people to do
anything, you know.

72
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:21,337
I bet I can even get Mike to do that
"thing". What is it?

73
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:27,571
I AM NOT gonna help you do that! Oh
my..

74
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:38,217
Hi. Em..I'm here to see Mr. Campbell
with Gucci.

75
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,286
The reservation is probably under
Gucci.

76
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:45,123
It..it's spelled like Gukki, which can
be confusing!

77
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:49,439
Mr. Campbell is not here yet. Let me
show you to his table.

78
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:55,673
Oh my god. That's my boss. You have to
seat us somewhere else.

79
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:58,167
I'm sorry. This's always Mr. Campbell's
table.

80
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:01,812
But my boss can not see me. I'm
interviewing for another job.

81
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:05,648
I know, with Gukki.

00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:11,019
Hah, I'm on a date!

That's great.

Yeah it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough.

86
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:19,460
You gotta get out there.

87
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,570
Well, you got uhm..good energy.

88
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,008
Ah..oh

89
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:23,296

90
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:24,256
Yes. Hi

92
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:25,790
-Hi -Hi

93
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,845
Execuse us.

94
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:30,489
-Please -OK

95
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,367
He's cute.

96
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:37,204
So..your resume is quite impressive.

97
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,423
My resume..

98
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,260
I wouldn't..I wouldn't call my online
dating profile a resume.

99
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:49,576
Dating profile. I'm talking about the
work resume..

100
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:53,413
La la...

101
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:57,249
Whatever happen to just singing for no
reason.

102
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:02,045
Maybe people found it weird.

103
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:02,620
Maybe

104
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:06,457
So..why do you wanna leave Ralph
Lauren?

105
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:09,238
What? I..I don't.

106
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:09,718
You don't?

107
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:11,252
No. I lo..love it there.

108
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:14,897
If you don't wanna leave, why are we
having this lunch?

109
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:17,295
--That is my boss--

110
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:18,159
What?

111
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,652
--That is my boss--

112
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:24,489
That's Hugo Boss?

113
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,025
This place is so depressing. If I had
to work here I'd kill myself.

114
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:39,834
But you obviously haven't.

115
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:40,794
How can I help you?

116
00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:44,630
Em..I need to change my name please. I
need to change it because I'm hiding
from the law.

117
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:50,768
You're fun.

118
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,495
-You need to fill out this form. -OK

119
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,318
I just don't... I don't know how it
work exactly.

120
00:06:54,318 --> 00:06:57,387
See, my name is Buffay and my husband's
name is Hannigan.

121
00:06:57,387 --> 00:07:00,456
So is it supposed to be Buffay Hannigan
or Hannigan Buffay?

122
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,278
It can be anything you want.

123
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,525
Well.not anything, I mean...

124
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:06,978
Yeah..anything

125
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:10,814
Oh..this could take a while.

126
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:14,651
Get out of my line.

127
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,392
Hey.

128
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:20,022
-Hey Phoebs. -Oh not anymore.

129
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,557
I changed it today.

130
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:23,379
Oh I'm sorry. Mrs. Hannigan.

131
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,831
Wrong again.

132
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:29,325
Apparently You can change it to
anything you want so I thought..

133
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:32,107
here's an opportunity to be creative.

134
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:35,944
So meet Princess Consuela Banana
Hammock.

135
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,398
That's what we're gonna name the baby.

136
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,714
-Phoeby -Not. Princess Consuela.

137
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:53,112
-You seriously changed your name to
that? -Uh-huh.

138
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:56,085
Ok. So from now on we have to call you
Princess Consuela.

139
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:59,922
Uhm no. I'm gonna have my friends call
me Valerie.

140
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:05,388
Hey how did the interview go?

141
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,731
Oh! It's not good.

142
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:10,568
You know, I always feel that way after
an interview. I'll bet it went better
than you think.

143
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:14,692
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and
I got fired from Ralph Lauren.

144
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:18,337
That is a bad interview.

145
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:20,351
What're you..what're you talking about?
How did this happen?

146
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:23,037
Well, my boss was at the same
restaurant

147
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,914
where I was having my interview and he
heard everything.

148
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:29,655
So later he calls me to his office and
he tells me that he's gonna let me go

149
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,477
because I'm not a team player.

150
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,300
And I say "Wait a minute. No. Yes I'm".

151
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,081
And then I had to sit there for 45
minutes

152
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,917
while he proved that in fact..was true.

153
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:45,001
Oh god. I'm so sorry.

154
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:48,837
Hey, Wa..wo..W..what's this?

155
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,811
It's..it's a bottle of champagne!

156
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:53,345
Why is this here?

157
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:53,921
Ross?

158
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:56,990
I guess it's here because I got TENURE!

159
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,332
Congratulations.

160
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,073
This a single greatest day of my
professional career.

161
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,704
Gunther, 6 glasses.

162
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:05,622
Six? You want me to join you?

163
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:09,458
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is
good.

164
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:15,117
Ah..I'm gonna have a loogie in my
coffee tomorrow.

165
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:18,954
Ooh..Israeli champagne. And it's
vanilla.

166
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:24,037
I got tenure and I didn't win the
lottery.

167
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,052
Hey Rach. So..How did your thing go?

168
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:29,600
Oh..good. Yeah..but I'm not gonna hear
from that for a couple of days.

169
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:32,574
Oh you know what, you're gonna get it.
I..I can feel it.

170
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,259
Can you?

171
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,890
Ah, allright. Here's to Ross.

172
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,726
And..and to years of hard work finally
paiying off.

173
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:45,330
And to knowing that your career doesn't
mean everything.

174
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:49,550
But also knowing it means A LOT.

175
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,427
But more importantly to full
well-rounded lives.

176
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,729
That center around work.

177
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,566
To ross.

178
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:04,225
You know what the best part about this
is? I can never be fired.

179
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:08,157
No seriously. I have job security for
life, you know.

180
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,596
I mean I never have to worry.

181
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:13,432
Oh..oh look at you. Look..how happy
you're for me.

182
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:19,763
No, it's not that. I got fired today
and I didn't get the other job.

183
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:26,284
Rachel I'm so sorry.

184
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:28,203
Oh~

185
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:29,353
Great. I feel like an idiot.

186
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:33,190
-No, it's OK. You didn't know. -Oh

187
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:37,027
Little heads-up would have been nice.

188
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:45,275
Thank you for letting us see the house
again.

189
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:48,057
And thank you for explaining to us what
escrow means.

190
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:51,318
I've already forgotten what you said.
But thank you.

191
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,154
Take as loog as you want. Just let me
know when you're through.

192
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,127
So glad you decided to come.

193
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:01,868
Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm
so happy for your guys.

194
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,705
Although you know I hope you like
fungus.

195
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:06,568
What?

196
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:10,020
Fungus. Yeah place is full of it.

197
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:12,706
No, it's not. We had an inspection and
I didn't find anything.

198
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:13,570
OK

199
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,543
Then I guess I have dry eyes and a
scratchy throat for no reason.

200
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:20,379
Maybe it's because you hung your head
out of the window like a dog the whole
ride here.

201
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:24,792
Maybe.

202
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:28,628
So this is the living room huh? Oof,
it's pretty dark.

203
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:36,205
-No it's not. -Are you kidding. I think
I just saw a bat in the corner.

204
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:41,384
When you head was hanging out of the
window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did
it?

205
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:45,796
Maybe.

206
00:11:45,797 --> 00:11:48,578
Well, I just think you guys can do
better than this house, you know,

207
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:50,975
or any other house for that matter.

208
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,812
Oh Joey. We know you're having a hard
time with this but we really..we love
it here.

209
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,936
Fine. OK. If you love this house so
much then you should just live here,
OK?

210
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:02,773
I just hope you get used to that weird
humming sound.

211
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,267
Joey, we know that's you.

212
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:09,103
No. It's not.

213
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,515
-Hey -Hey

214
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:14,379
Welcome back.

215
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,201
-I missed you. -Oh Me too.

216
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,351
So what's new?

217
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:19,653
Well I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.

218
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:21,092
That's great. You changed your name?

219
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:24,929
Yes I did. Meet Princess Consuela
Banana Hammock.

220
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:28,670
You're kidding, right?

221
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,012
Nope.

222
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:30,780
You really did that?

223
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,314
Yep.

224
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:34,232
You..but you can't do that.

225
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:38,069
Why? Why? It's fun. It's different. No
one else has a name like it.

226
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,289
Alright. Then I'm gonna change my name.

227
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,878
Great. OK, what you're gonna change it
to?

228
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,660
Crap Bag.

229
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:49,195
Mike Crap Bag?

230
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:53,031
No. No mike. No. Just Crap Bag. First
name Crap last name Bag.

231
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,292
You're not serious, right?

232
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:59,649
Yeah I'm serious. It's fun. It's
different. No one else has a name like
that.

233
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,088
Uh-huh.

234
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:04,253
Well then great. If you love it, I love
it.

235
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:07,418
I do love it, and I love your name. I
love Princess Consuela.

236
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:11,255
And I love Crap.

237
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:18,831
Ou..

238
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:19,887
Who are you?

239
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:23,723
Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are
buying this house? Who are you?

240
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:28,231
I am Mackenzie. My stupid parents are
selling this house.

241
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,260
I hate my parents.

242
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,096
I hate my friends.

243
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:40,604
Look, there's gotta be a way that we
can stop this from happening.

244
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:43,385
Like what?

245
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:44,920
Oh..OK.

246
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,893
You come with me and you tell them that
the house is haunted.

247
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:51,730
What are you eight?

248
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,991
Ok. Let's hear your great idea.

249
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:58,827
I don't have any great ideas. I am
eight.

250
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:04,295
There's gotta be a way. I mean, you
know, Monica and Chandler move out here

251
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:06,117
and now Phoebe is married to Mike.

252
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:09,953
That just leaves me and Ross and
Rachel, you know what I mean?

253
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:13,406
I really don't.

254
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:16,380
What am I gonna do? I feel like I'm
losing my friends.

255
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,106
My parents say I'm gonna make new
friends.

256
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:21,942
Oh yeah, sure, easy for you. You're
younger than me. I am set in my ways.

257
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:28,081
This's what my mom always talking
about: Whiners's winners.

258
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:35,082
Look. You want your friends to be
happy, right?

259
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:37,864
Yeah..yeah. I guess yeah.

260
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:41,700
Well if moving here is gonna make them
happy. Don't you want them to do it?

261
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:45,920
Yeah. Maybe.

262
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:49,757
Then you gotta let them go.

263
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:56,950
I hate to admit it, but you're probably
right.

264
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:00,979
How did you get to be so smart?

265
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:03,952
I read a lot.

266
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:07,789
Just when I thought we could be
friends.

267
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:12,776
Oh, here, Rach. I just heard it. I'm so
sorry.

268
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:15,270
Oh thank you.

269
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,531
You still don't know my name, do you?

270
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:22,367
Well, now I don't have to.

271
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:28,218
Ross, what is taking you so long?

272
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:38,193
I'm sorry. It's almost as if this
wasn't built for quick getaway.

273
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,564
Rachel?

274
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:46,346
Mark? Oh my god.

275
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,839
-How have you been? -I'm fantastic!

276
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,292
-You remember Ross? -Sure sure.

277
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:54,978
What's with the chair?

278
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:58,814
Uh..you know, you can't always get a
seat on the subway so...

279
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,651
Clever.

280
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:03,897
So..so how are you?

281
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:06,679
Ah..You're not catching me on my best
day.

282
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,940
Yeah a box full of your desk stuff
doesn't exactly say big promotion.

283
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:12,722
No, but it's good, you know. I'm gonna
take some time off..

284
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,448
some charity work.

285
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:17,229
Are you sure? Because we may have
something at Louis Vuitton.

286
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,203
Well, screw charity work, what've you
got?

287
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:22,217
Why don't we have dinner tonight and
talk about it?

288
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:22,984
-Great -Great

289
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:24,903
-I'll call you. -Ok

290
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:28,739
-Nice to see you. -Yeah..yeah I got
tenure.

291
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:34,014
Oh my god.

292
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:37,371
So see, I told you something good would
come along.

293
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,441
And he seemed really nice. I..I have
met him before?

294
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:42,742
Ross, that's Mark.

295
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:46,387
Fron Bloomingdales, you were insanely
jealous of him.

296
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:50,223
That is Mark. I hate that guy.

297
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:53,388
No..no. You can not go to dinner with
him.

298
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:55,211
What? You don't want me to get a job?

299
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:59,047
Oh yeah. I'm suer he is gonna give you
a job. Maybe make you his sex retary.

300
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:02,884
I am serious. I just don't trust that
guy. OK?

301
00:17:02,884 --> 00:17:06,720
Ross, you know what? Ok, let's talk
about later. There comes security.

302
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:21,011
Oh I love this street. The trees, the
big front yards.

303
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:23,793
That actual picket fences.

304
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,629
Man, those two dogs are going at it!

305
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,027
Hey.

306
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,178
Hey, where have been?

307
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:34,919
Oh, Just..you know looking around. But
you know what,

308
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,220
this house is great.

309
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:38,947
Really, what changed your mind?

310
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:42,784
The little girl who lives here made
feel a lot better about the whole
thing.

311
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:47,100
Joey, there was a little girl who lived
here but she died like 30 years ago.

312
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,581
What?

313
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:57,937
Huh~I'm just messing with you.

314
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:01,774
That's not funny. You know I'm afraid
of little girl ghost.

315
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:05,707
Joey, now you're OK with the house, you
wanna go see your room?

316
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:09,159
What? I get my own room.

317
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,996
You don't think we buy a house and not
have a Joey room, do you?

318
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:17,024
Oh my god.

319
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:21,820
Can I have an aquarium and a sex swing?

320
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:23,547
No.

321
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:27,383
Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.

322
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:31,028
After you, Mrs. Banana Hammock.

323
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,809
Thank you, Mr. Bag.

324
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,071
-Oh, hey how are you? -Ah, hi Rita.

325
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:38,797
Rita is a massage client.

326
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:40,331
-Yeah. -Oh

327
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:44,168
Why don't you introduce me?

328
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,045
Rita, this my husband.

329
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:50,402
Why don't you tell her my name?

330
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:51,649
Ok, I will.

331
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:55,485
This is..this is my husband..Crap Bag.

332
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:57,884
Crap Bag.

333
00:18:57,884 --> 00:19:01,720
If you need an easy way to remember it,
just think of a bag of crap.

334
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:08,242
OK. Execuse me.

335
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:13,805
Ok, fine. You made your point. Can you
please just be Mike Hannigan again?

336
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:17,257
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.

337
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:20,231
How about Buffay Henegen?

338
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:21,190
Really?

339
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:25,027
Yeah, I'm Phoebe Buffay Hannigan Banana
Hammock.

340
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:29,343
Do you even know what a banana hammock
is?

341
00:19:29,343 --> 00:19:30,877
It's a funny word.

342
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,714
It's a speedo.

343
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:40,564
Oh, crap.

344
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:43,442
Hey, is Rachel here?

345
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:44,688
Nope.

346
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,511
She's still at dinner?

347
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:47,854
I guess. who's she with?

348
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,251
That guy Mark from Bloomingdale's.

349
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:54,088
She think he's just being nice to her,
but I know he really wants to sleep
with her.

350
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,116
It's 7 years ago. My time machine
works!

351
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:05,118
We ran into him on the street today and
he said he might have a job for her,

352
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,667
but I know he just wants to get into
her pants.

353
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:12,503
So what if he want to sleep with her? I
mean, she is single and he is cute.

354
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:14,806
Execuse me?

355
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:20,560
Oh please. Yesterday on the subway you
couldn't stop staring at that woman
with a big breast the whole time.

356
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:24,492
For your information, I was staring at
her baby. We're about to be parents.

357
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:30,055
Oh sorry.

358
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:39,359
Hi you guys.

359
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,852
Hi. So..how was dinner?

360
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,442
Oh it was great. Mark is so sweet.

361
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:48,087
Oh yeah yeah. I wonder why. What could
that smarmy letch possibly want?

362
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:50,293
Oh Ross. Come on.

363
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:53,842
He is happily married. His wife just
had twins.

364
00:20:53,842 --> 00:20:56,719
Should we send something?

365
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,597
How did the job stuff go?

366
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,898
He offered me one.

367
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:04,680
-That's great! -Congratulations

368
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,269
I know it's amazing. It's amazing.

369
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,147
It's so much better than what I had at
Ralph Lauren.

370
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:12,352
The money is Great.

371
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:13,791
Can we..can we just stop for a second.

372
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:17,148
Who said something better would come
along, huh?

373
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:20,122
You didn't believe me. I told you
everything was gonna work out.

374
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:23,958
You know what, this calls for a bottle
of Israel's finest.

375
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,536
The job is in Paris.

376
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,374
I mean the soap opera is a great gig,

377
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,654
but..am I missing opportunities?

378
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:50,504
You know, I've always thought of myself
as a serious actor.

379
00:21:50,504 --> 00:21:53,448
I mean..should I be trying to do more
independent movies?

380
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,584
I don't know.

381
00:21:56,585 --> 00:22:00,384
You know what, I'm gonna put you off my
bear. Hold on.

382
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,799
Hey bear, I need some career advice.
