1
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:05,726  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, you guys? What are
you doing tomorrow night?

2
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:09,010  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, well, let me see.
I believe I'm....

3
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:11,243  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

4
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:15,444  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.

5
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:17,171  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
I could fall asleep at a play.

6
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:20,249  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What is it?
-It's a one-woman play called:

7
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:24,452  X1:077 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why Don't You Like Me?
A Bitter Woman's Journey Through Life.

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,493  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
-That sounds interesting.
-That does sound interesting.

9
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:32,010  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
To listen to a woman complain for
two hours. I don't think it gets bet--

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,730  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:523
I know! I know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.

11
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:39,282  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
What more do these broads want?

12
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:42,482  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, you guys will have a great time.
I promise.

13
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:44,325  X1:078 X2:641 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? How come you don't have to go?

14
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:46,006  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:486 Y2:523
I wish I could, but I found out...

15
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:49,529  X1:126 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that I have to be at work really
early the next day, so I can't go.

16
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,207  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.

17
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:55,168  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:486 Y2:523
Let's see. Who do I hate?

18
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,652  X1:274 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, sorry.

19
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:00,372  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oops, sorry.
-Okay.

20
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,046  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay.
-Okay. Up we go.

21
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,329  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, gosh, okay!
-All right.

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,768  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can I ask you a question?

23
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:19,848  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:523
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...

24
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,085  X1:136 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and not have it be a big deal?

25
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:26,842  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, I don't think that ever works.
Why?

26
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,208  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:446 Y2:523
-No reason.
-No, no. Rachel?

27
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:34,008  X1:084 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Who do you want to fool around with?
-Nobody! Forget it.

28
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:35,242  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey?

29
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:37,691  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe.

30
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:40,246  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You can't.
-Why?

31
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:41,562  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because!

32
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:48,243  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, seriously, did not understand
a word you just said.

33
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:51,403  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:444 Y2:523
-In the hall.
-Okay.

34
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:55,770  X1:111 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You wanna fool around with Joey?
-Yeah.

35
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,323  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ever since I had that dream about him,
I can't get it out of my head.

36
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:02,007  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.

37
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:04,733  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
Who do you know that are friends
that just fool around?

38
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:08,966  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay. Off the top of my head....
Don and Janet.

39
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,693  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Who are they?
-I know them from work.

40
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,528  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Both of them?
-No, just one of them.

41
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,411  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:523
Which one?

42
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:19,373  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know.
What were the names I just said?

43
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,206  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, Rachel, things could get
incredibly complicated.

44
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:25,683  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're right. I won't do anything
with Joey. I just thought it--

45
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:30,483  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
a pound of baking soda and a red onion?

46
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,525  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
What the hell are you cooking?

47
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,164  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:523
The One With The Soap Opera Party

48
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:28,046  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:442 Y2:523
You guys won't believe
what I have to do for work today.

49
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:32,570  X1:114 X2:606 Y1:054 Y2:133
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.

50
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,969  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:054 Y2:133
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...

51
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:41,009  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:054 Y2:133
...and I have to meet them here
and show them around campus.

52
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:42,242  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:486 Y2:523
What's bad about that?

53
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:45,007  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:134
I just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...

54
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:48,563  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:054 Y2:133
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.

55
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,568  X1:307 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ross?

56
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,293  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:486 Y2:523
What? These aren't suede.

57
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:59,685  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:054 Y2:095
Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

58
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,765  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:129
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?

59
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:03,922  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:054 Y2:089
No.

60
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,485  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:523
Hi. Hi, I'm Ross Geller.

61
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:13,292  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:054 Y2:092
Oh, hi. I'm Professor Wheeler.

62
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:17,570  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:054 Y2:129
Oh, that's-- That's--
That's nice.

63
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:19,487  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:054 Y2:095
It's good to meet you.

64
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:22,406  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:054 Y2:128
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.

65
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:24,325  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:054 Y2:095
No, it's no big deal.

66
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:28,645  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:054 Y2:134
If I weren't doing this, I'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.

67
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:30,887  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:054 Y2:094
Is he gonna introduce us?

68
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:34,250  X1:141 X2:579 Y1:054 Y2:129
I think we're just blurry shapes
to him now.

69
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,283  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
By the way,
I really enjoyed your paper...

70
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:41,731  X1:076 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
...on the connection between geographic
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

71
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:44,733  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
I wrote that in one night.

72
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,807  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:523
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.

73
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,968  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, we should probably get going.

74
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:54,809  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

75
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,567  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:442 Y2:523
Isn't another professor
supposed to come with us?

76
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,324  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't think so.

77
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:03,207  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?

78
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:06,331  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:

79
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:10,281  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:523
If you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.

80
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:13,490  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:482 Y2:523
An option that many of my students use.

81
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,324  X1:161 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Shall we?
-We shouldn't wait for him?

82
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:19,610  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know what, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll find us, okay?

83
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:22,048  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Professor Geller?
-Oh, damn it!

84
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:34,887  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

85
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:39,490  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Listen, I forgot your address.
Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.

86
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:43,928  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's happening?

87
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:48,204  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.

88
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:51,285  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'd love to, but I gotta get up
so early the next day.

89
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:55,002  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You know me, work comes first.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

90
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:59,847  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

91
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:03,768  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
Stupid Jan Rogers!

92
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,644  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
You are having a party tonight?

93
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:10,210  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm kind of having a thing
for the Days of Our Lives people.

94
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:11,692  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
You weren't gonna tell us?

95
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:14,162  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
How did you think
you'd get away with that?

96
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,085  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:523
I do it every year.

97
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:19,609  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:523
You do that every year?!

98
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:21,843  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
I didn't have to tell you that!

99
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,767  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers!

100
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,805  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's why you got us tickets
to that play, to get rid of us!

101
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,008  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

102
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:33,483  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:523
Last year is that why you sent us
to that Medieval Times restaurant?

103
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:34,802  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

104
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:40,090  X1:096 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
The year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?

105
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:43,211  X1:151 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
I can't believe you guys went
for that one.

106
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:45,568  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:442 Y2:523
Why wouldn't you invite us
to your parties?

107
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:49,886  X1:071 X2:648 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.

108
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:52,806  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, then, so just invite me.

109
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:56,490  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
Please, I was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.

110
00:06:56,653 --> 00:07:00,487  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. I will behave. I promise.

111
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,009  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I will behave. Please, please, please.
-Okay, fine. You can come.

112
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,643  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:442 Y2:523
But don't tell anybody else.
It's up on the roof at 8.

113
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:09,326  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
A soap-opera roof party?!

114
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:13,008  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

115
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,564  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
And it's out of my system.

116
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:28,331  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
And then my wife and I went
on a cruise to the Galapagos.

117
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:32,532  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.

118
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:37,603  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
There were clams and mussels
and oysters...

119
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,968  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:488 Y2:523
...and cracked crab...

120
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,203  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
...and snow crab...

121
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,762  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and king crab.

122
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:47,925  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.

123
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:52,251  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?

124
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:56,008  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:523
-And that's not all I'm allergic to.
-Oh, it's not over.

125
00:07:56,173 --> 00:08:00,132  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm also allergic to peanuts
and cashews...

126
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,363  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
...and almonds and filberts--

127
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,125  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
So basically all nuts!

128
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:06,449  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:523
Interestingly, no.

129
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,928  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're kind of playing it fast and loose
with the word "interesting."

130
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:16,088  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:442 Y2:523
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to use the restroom.

131
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:18,811  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

132
00:08:18,973 --> 00:08:21,043  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:486 Y2:523
I've lost the will to live.

133
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:24,126  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Let's ditch him.
-What?

134
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,887  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:442 Y2:523
While he's still in the bathroom.
I am begging you.

135
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:30,682  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. Okay, fine,
but I just have one question for you.

136
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:33,811  X1:082 X2:634 Y1:486 Y2:523
When we exit, should we walk or run...

137
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:36,248  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
...or prance or stroll--?

138
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:41,043  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:444 Y2:523
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,
but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!

139
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:52,523  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.

140
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,492  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.

141
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:58,690  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi.
-Charlie will be joining my department.

142
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:00,923  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You're a paleontologist too?
-Yeah.

143
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,209  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...

144
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:07,525  X1:098 X2:623 Y1:442 Y2:523
...of Renyard's new theory of species
variegation in segmented arthropods?

145
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:13,884  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.

146
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:17,326  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.
Excuse me.

147
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:20,081  X1:079 X2:640 Y1:482 Y2:523
Renyard's theory of species variegation?

148
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:25,202  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
I saw the article on your coffee table.
I memorized the title to freak you out.

149
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:28,885  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
So did you two have fun?

150
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,408  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God. She's great.

151
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:35,691  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
We have so much in common, and she's
just cool, you know? And funny.

152
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,402  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:523
And I don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!

153
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,722  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hi!

154
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:50,242  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
I'm not feeling really well...

155
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:53,689  X1:125 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and I don't think I'm gonna get
to go to the play.

156
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:55,127  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really? What's wrong?

157
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:57,409  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
I don't know.
I think it's kind of serious.

158
00:09:57,573 --> 00:10:00,883  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, I was watching this thing
on TV this morning...

159
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:05,126  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
...about Newcastle disease,
and I think I might have it.

160
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:07,882  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:523
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...

161
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,692  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that only affects chickens
and other poultry.

162
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,445  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, who's this?

163
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:18,170  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.

164
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,164  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi. Well, I would shake your hand...

165
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,484  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:442 Y2:523
...but I'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.

166
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:27,085  X1:106 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Rachel, can I see you for a second?
-Sure.

167
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,287  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:486 Y2:523
You're not sick.

168
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:35,331  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:486 Y2:523
What? Yes, I am!

169
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:37,848  X1:085 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?

170
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:43,647  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:442 Y2:523
When you're sick, you do whatever
you can to make yourself feel better.

171
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:48,324  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.

172
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:51,166  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, I heard you before.
That is so not what this is.

173
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,483  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, then what is this?

174
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,122  X1:302 X2:405 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

175
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:59,210  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey is having a secret
Days of Our Lives party up on the roof.

176
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:01,807  X1:125 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
And he sent you guys to the play
to get rid of you.

177
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:03,885  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?!

178
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:05,887  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? What's going on?

179
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:09,523  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey is having a secret
Days of Our Lives party up on the roof !

180
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:13,925  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:442 Y2:523
He didn't want you to know about it,
but I came over here to tell you.

181
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:17,883  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You came to say you were sick.
-All right, professor or detective?

182
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:22,403  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:442 Y2:523
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?

183
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:26,009  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.

184
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:30,212  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's why he sent us to that medieval
restaurant and to that button factory.

185
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:32,523  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
And that horrible museum tour?

186
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:34,571  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, I arranged that.

187
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,085  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.
Have fun.

188
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,011  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:523
We know about your party, Joey.

189
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,529  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What party?
-The game's over. Take off your robe.

190
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:52,371  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, I mean....

191
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:58,044  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
Close it up! Close it up!

192
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,247  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:523
Nice to meet you.

193
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,244  X1:161 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, you made it! All right!

194
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,529  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.

195
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:17,726  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Oh, my God. K yle Lowder!
-Hi.

196
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,045  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you!

197
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:23,728  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's why I didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?

198
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,804  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just get yourself a drink
or something.

199
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:28,726  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.

200
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:32,412  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?

201
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:34,052  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can barely control myself.

202
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,727  X1:151 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
You might want to remember
that you're married.

203
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:39,043  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
Where is Chandler anyway?

204
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:40,726  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God! Chandler!

205
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:49,692  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
Where the hell is everybody?

206
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,333  X1:184 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why Don't You Like Me?

207
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:01,250  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
Chapter 1: My First Period.

208
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:07,644  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Joey said no autographs.

209
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:09,849  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:523
But if she's getting one,
I want one too!

210
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:13,972  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
"To Monica." And none of this
"best wishes" crap. I want "love."

211
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,971  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.

212
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,806  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, man! If I had known
I was coming to this party...

213
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:23,770  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I never would've gotten married!

214
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:26,884  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
-It was nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

215
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:29,044  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Call me.
-We will!

216
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:35,130  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look at you with all the guys!
I guess you've forgotten all about Joey.

217
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,966  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten
about Joey.

218
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,408  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:523
And clearly, you've forgotten
about Chandler.

219
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:43,409  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:442 Y2:523
Please. Chandler's
the love of my life.

220
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,564  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!

221
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,241  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:442 Y2:523
So it's probably gonna be hard
for you to leave Boston, huh?

222
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:56,122  X1:071 X2:645 Y1:442 Y2:523
Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving.
I just broke up with someone.

223
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,443  X1:264 X2:443 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, so sad.

224
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:01,567  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:442 Y2:523
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.

225
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:05,646  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
Especially after working with a Nobel
Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.

226
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,726  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
Actually, Albie is the guy
I broke up with.

227
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:11,885  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
-Yeah.

228
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:14,851  X1:155 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:523
And you called him "Albie"?

229
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:19,692  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:523
I mean, that's like calling
Albert Einstein....

230
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:21,442  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Albie.

231
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:25,329  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:486 Y2:523
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

232
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,563  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
You think?
I mean, you dated the guy...

233
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,043  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!

234
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:35,365  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...

235
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,125  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:488 Y2:523
...he had a lot of issues.

236
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,090  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, like what?

237
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:42,490  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.
It's just that this must be...

238
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:46,646  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
...what regular people experience
when they watch Access Hollywood.

239
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,765  X1:176 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, you want the dirt?

240
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,969  X1:149 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:523
Albie was seriously insecure.

241
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:54,205  X1:104 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
He was really intimidated by the guy
I dated before him.

242
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:57,649  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?

243
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,724  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:523
A guy who won two.

244
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:01,481  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:488 Y2:523
Two? What--?

245
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:04,486  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:442 Y2:523
Don't tell me you dated
Benjamin Hobart?

246
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,450  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, for three years.

247
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:07,932  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

248
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:12,891  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:523
Have you ever dated someone
who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?

249
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,891  X1:317 X2:390 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

250
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:18,689  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
But there was
my first boyfriend, Billy.

251
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:21,083  X1:113 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?

252
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,404  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, but he did just win
a MacArthur "genius grant."

253
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:27,282  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:523
What a loser.

254
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:30,610  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Some more wine?

255
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,922  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hey, Ross. How's it going
with Charlie?

256
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:38,890  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, great. After I finish my wine...

257
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:42,807  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:442 Y2:523
...l'm gonna blow
my average-sized brains out.

258
00:15:43,253 --> 00:15:44,481  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:486 Y2:523
What's the matter?

259
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:49,090  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:523
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.

260
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:51,926  X1:090 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earlier today...

261
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:56,245  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.

262
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,564  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:523
I always loved that.

263
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:02,089  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:523
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!

264
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:06,087  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.

265
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:08,687  X1:149 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
They're so out of my league.

266
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,242  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

267
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:12,290  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Worse?
-Oh, much, much worse.

268
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:16,446  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
I did my impression of Joan Rivers
as one of the earliest amphibians.

269
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:17,682  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:486 Y2:523
"Can we walk?"

270
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,008  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Oh, you like that?
-No.

271
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:23,367  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

272
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,730  X1:140 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
Come on! I think that's funny!

273
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:28,931  X1:220 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:523
Woolly mammoth.

274
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:30,731  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's good!

275
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:36,766  X1:083 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
I bet you're thinking that now would be
a great time for an intermission, huh?

276
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,447  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, yes. God, yes.

277
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:41,844  X1:130 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, you're not gonna get one!

278
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:45,289  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because in life, there are
no intermissions, people!

279
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:50,122  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:523
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!

280
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:54,248  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:488 Y2:523
How could he leave me?!

281
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,493  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't know. You seem lovely.

282
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:09,246  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.

283
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,722  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Nice to meet you.
-So, what show are you on?

284
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:15,124  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm not an actor.
I'm a professor of paleontology.

285
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,605  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's science.

286
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:20,772  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, well, listen,
I play a scientist on Days.

287
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,686  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yeah, my character just won
a Nobel Prize.

288
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:30,243  X1:072 X2:647 Y1:444 Y2:523
Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you two are together?

289
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:32,568  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, no, but....

290
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:36,487  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, she only goes out
with really, really smart guys.

291
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:39,645  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.

292
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,806  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'd lead with that.

293
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,686  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.

294
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,522  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:523
Monica!

295
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:53,085  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:442 Y2:523
Don't worry, Joe.
I won't come next year!

296
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,167  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the--?

297
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,561  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:523
What do you got there?

298
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,122  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just some boys gave me
their phone numbers.

299
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:04,443  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, really? Let me see.

300
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:07,522  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
Damn, that's a lot of guys.

301
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,888  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you a little slutty?

302
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,689  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think I am.

303
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:16,766  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
Let me see if I approve
of any of these clowns.

304
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:19,083  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:523
-This guy wears a rug.
-Well....

305
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:21,562  X1:202 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
This guy's Canadian.

306
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,521  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?

307
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:29,244  X1:074 X2:645 Y1:442 Y2:523
It'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and I don't feel any different.

308
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:32,764  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:523
Pass. Pa-- Oh, pass. Pass.

309
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:36,005  X1:090 X2:630 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Why? What's wrong with these guys?
-Well, nothing major.

310
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:39,449  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's just that, you know,
they're not really good enough for you...

311
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,729  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and you deserve the best.

312
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,048  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey, you're so sweet.

313
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:48,411  X1:080 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's true, but it doesn't matter. I already
know who you're going home with.

314
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:50,211  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who?

315
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:54,887  X1:321 X2:397 Y1:488 Y2:523
Me.

316
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,606  X1:298 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

317
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:58,845  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

318
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:02,210  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, because we live together.
It's a joke! It's a joke.

319
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:04,568  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
Right! That's funny! I get it!

320
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,531  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Got you!
-You're funny, Joey.

321
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,685  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

322
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:18,132  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
So how did you enjoy the play?

323
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:23,289  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.

324
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,442  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
You should be.

325
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:28,652  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
You missed the most powerful
three hours in the history of the theater.

326
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:31,850  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You really liked it?
-Oh, yeah. I mean, at first I hated it.

327
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:36,052  X1:084 X2:635 Y1:448 Y2:523
But why wouldn't I? Because as a man,
I've been trained not to listen!

328
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:43,842  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
But after Chapter 16:
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...

329
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:46,729  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I was uplifted.

330
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:48,808  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yeah.

331
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:52,090  X1:124 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
I had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.

332
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:56,042  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
Tell me--
Tell me about your first period.

333
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:58,927  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
No!

334
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,171  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
Did somebody sign your bra?

335
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,167  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
So I got it when I was 13.
Very difficult.

336
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:11,804  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?

337
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:15,488  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are you really just gonna let
a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?

338
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,883  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?

339
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:20,044  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's actually a million-dollar prize.

340
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:22,290  X1:262 X2:445 Y1:486 Y2:523
Go, Charlie!

341
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:25,088  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
But my point is...

342
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:29,007  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.

343
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:34,531  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:442 Y2:523
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.

344
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:40,250  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, maybe, and I do have
my whole career in front of me.

345
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,812  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:523
I mean....

346
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:44,771  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:488 Y2:523
I could still win a Nobel Prize.

347
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:50,530  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
Although the last two papers
I've written were widely discredited.

348
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:57,128  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.

349
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:58,732  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:523
And sexy.

350
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:01,890  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, well, give her a chance
to see all that.

351
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,124  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

352
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:06,727  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Thanks. I'm gonna go find her.
-Good for you.

353
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:11,603  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
Your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.

354
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,684  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Stop going through my stuff !

355
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:20,732  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just wanted to let you know
I've changed my mind.

356
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:22,849  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna kiss Joey.

357
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:26,323  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

358
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,449  X1:092 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
Please! What about you and Chandler?

359
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:31,446  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's different.
I was drunk and stupid.

360
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:33,843  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, hello?

361
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:38,043  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
What about all the guys that you got
the phone numbers from?

362
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,681  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Why don't you just kiss one of them.
-I could...

363
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:44,243  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:442 Y2:523
...but I don't want to.
I want to kiss Joey.

364
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:48,727  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
All right. I think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.

365
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:54,772  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm gonna do it.

366
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,327  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:523
-And I can't stop you?
-No.

367
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:13,010  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, Rach, have you seen
Charlie anywhere?

368
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:20,808  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm smarter than him!

369
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:29,446  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:130
Hey, thank you so much
for these tickets, Chandler.

370
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:33,811  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:054 Y2:133
This was a really important experience
for me. I wanted to share it with you.

371
00:22:33,973 --> 00:22:35,691  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:054 Y2:090
You're so wonderful.

372
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:38,964  X1:184 X2:540 Y1:054 Y2:094
Why Don't You Like Me?

373
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:43,649  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:054 Y2:094
Chapter 1: My First Period.

374
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,929  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:054 Y2:134
I can't believe you guys bought that.
Enjoy your slow death.
