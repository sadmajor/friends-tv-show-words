1
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:07,650
This kitty is Mittens.
This one is Fitzhugh.

2
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:10,611
And this little guy
in the cat condo is Jinkies.

3
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:15,891
That's a lot of cats, Jo Lynn.

4
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:17,122
Single, are you?

5
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:20,922
Chandler Bing.

6
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:24,563
How come you're answering your own
phone? Where's your crazy assistant?

7
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,242
What's up, Joe?

8
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:31,489
What have we always wanted
to do together?

9
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:35,165
Braid each other's hair
and ride horseback on the beach?

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,642
No. No. No. When you get home
tomorrow night...

11
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:41,044
...you and I are gonna be
at the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside!

12
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:42,652
-Courtside? Oh, my God!
-Yeah!

13
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:46,482
Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for
the ball and break my jaw with his knee!

14
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,883
That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.

15
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,852
-Hello?
-Joey just called.

16
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,925
He's got courtside Knicks tickets
for him and me tomorrow night.

17
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,364
But tomorrow night's the only night
I get off from the restaurant.

18
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,001
If you go, we won't have
a night together for a week.

19
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:07,246
But honey, it's courtside!
The cheerleaders will be right in--

20
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:10,162
That's not the way to convince you.

21
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,403
I don't wanna be one
of those wives that says:

22
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,371
"You can't go to the game.
You have to spend time with me."

23
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,808
So if you could just realize
it on your own....

24
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:21,845
I know. You're right.
I wanna see you too.

25
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:25,050
I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.
He's looking forward to it.

26
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:27,602
Tell him you haven't seen
your wife in a long time.

27
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:31,488
Tell him that having a long-distance
relationship is really difficult.

28
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:35,612
Tell him that what little time
we have together is precious.

29
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,332
I'll think of something.

30
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,969
The One With Rachel's Phone Number

31
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:25,121
You look....

32
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:30,252
I mean, it's just....
That dress....

33
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:33,247
Well, I hope the ends
of these sentences are good.

34
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:36,485
They're good. It's just been a while
since I've seen you like this.

35
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,564
You clean up good.

36
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,682
Really? Well, thank you.

37
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,530
Okay, stop looking at me like that.

38
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:50,486
-Last time that happened, that happened.
-Right, right.

39
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:59,562
So are you excited about
your first night away from Emma?

40
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,122
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I
are gonna have so much fun.

41
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:05,091
-Thank you for watching the baby.
-It's fine.

42
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,289
Actually, I invited Mike over.

43
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,442
-Phoebe's Mike?
-Yeah.

44
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,644
-I didn't know you hung out.
-We don't...

45
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:12,571
...but I'd like to get to know him.

46
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,566
Maybe have a little dinner,
drinks, conversation.

47
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:18,367
That's so cute.
Ross and Mike's first date.

48
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:22,807
Will that be awkward?
What are you gonna talk about?

49
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:26,164
I don't know. But you know, we have
a lot in common, you know?

50
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,245
He plays piano.
I played keyboards in college.

51
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:34,369
He's been divorced.
I have some experience in that area.

52
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:38,569
-Yeah?
-Hi!

53
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,166
Girl's night out indeed.

54
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,688
So I think Emma is probably
down for the night...

55
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,969
-...but if you need anything--
-We'll be fine.

56
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,964
-You go have fun.
-Okay, you too.

57
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,408
-Thanks.
-And I hope you score.

58
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,042
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

59
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:58,681
So, welcome.

60
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:02,484
-I got beer.
-I got bottled breast milk.

61
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,126
-Why don't we start with the beer.
-Okay.

62
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:14,724
-So Phoebe tells me you play piano.
-Yeah.

63
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:17,566
You know, I used to play keyboards
in college.

64
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,372
Do you have one here?

65
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,446
No.

66
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,449
Okay.

67
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:45,328
You know, I'm divorced.

68
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,567
Phoebe-- Phoebe says you're--
You've been divorced?

69
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,849
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:53,806
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't really like
to talk about it.

71
00:04:57,053 --> 00:05:00,443
That's okay. We'll talk about
something else.

72
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,288
-So you're a paleontologist, right?
-Yeah.

73
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,364
My cousin's a paleontologist.

74
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:21,852
Well, he and I would probably have
a lot to talk about.

75
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,288
-Welcome home.
-Well, look at you.

76
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:31,045
Yeah. What do you think?

77
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:33,364
Well, it looks great. It's just--

78
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,684
I'm wearing the same thing
underneath, so....

79
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,248
You see what I mean?

80
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,683
Hey! How come your door's locked?

81
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:45,730
-Just a second!
-No, no, no!

82
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,485
-Joey can't know I'm here.
-Why not?

83
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:49,962
I didn't want to say
I couldn't go to the game...

84
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:53,205
-...so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
-So you lied to him?

85
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:57,042
It's always better to lie than to have
the complicated discussion.

86
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:00,245
Except with you.

87
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:05,049
Hey, open the door! What's going on?

88
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:09,966
-What are you--?
-Hi.

89
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,647
Why are you dressed like that?

90
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:16,206
Because Chandler's gonna be home
in a couple of days...

91
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:20,048
...so I thought I would just, you know,
practice the art of seduction.

92
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:22,284
I thought I heard a man's voice before.

93
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:25,092
No, I was just doing Chandler's side
of the conversation.

94
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,483
You know, like, "Hi, how do I look?"

95
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:31,771
"Really sexy. Could I be any more
turned on?" You know?

96
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,971
Okay. Wait a minute.

97
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,010
Why are there two glasses
of wine out?

98
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,444
Because one of them is for you!

99
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:45,526
Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.

100
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:51,729
You know, it's funny. I've been
practicing the art of seduction myself.

101
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,364
-You might wanna keep practicing.
-Yeah.

102
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,086
-It's Joey.
-What?

103
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:04,131
-Hey, Joe.
-Dude, come home!

104
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:09,168
-What? Why?
-Come home!

105
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:11,125
Look, I can't. What's going on?

106
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,962
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I think Monica's cheating on you!

107
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,966
I told you, you shouldn't have married
someone hotter than you!

108
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:23,288
If you can't deal with this,
then I'm gonna.

109
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,723
-No!
-I just heard him!

110
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,487
Can you hear him now?

111
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,849
No. All right, I'm going in.

112
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,566
-No, wait!
-I heard him again!

113
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,083
All right, just stay there.
I'm coming home.

114
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:42,726
I'll see you when you get here.

115
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:45,043
I'll wait out in the hall
in case he comes out.

116
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,566
-Is that really necessary?
-Absolutely. You'd do it for me.

117
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:53,170
Not that you ever have to, because
I know how to keep my women satisfied.

118
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,563
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?

119
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:12,126
I mean, they said 30 minutes or less.
Well, how long has it been?

120
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:15,528
Eleven minutes.

121
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,722
And now 12.

122
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:30,692
-So you like the beer?
-I do. I do.

123
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:34,448
Although, it's actually a lager.

124
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,409
What's the difference
between beer and lager?

125
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:42,047
I don't know.

126
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:44,847
We could look it up.

127
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:49,850
Things are about to get wild.

128
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:57,487
Oh, God, remember the girls' nights
we used to have...

129
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,689
...sitting around talking
about you and Ross?

130
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:02,162
Oh, God! It seems like forever ago.

131
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,322
I know.

132
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:06,962
So, what's going on
with you and Ross?

133
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:12,568
Well, I don't know. I mean,
for a long time, nothing.

134
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:16,362
But you know, actually,
right before you picked me up...

135
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,967
...Ross and I had a little thing.

136
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:22,006
Oh, my God! I love things!
What happened?

137
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:25,364
Well, first he told me
he liked how I looked.

138
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:29,242
And then we had a little...

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,483
...eye contact.

140
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,002
Eye contact?

141
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:36,885
I hope you were using protection.

142
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:44,251
Excuse me, these are from
the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

143
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:48,089
Should we send them something back?
Let's send them mashed potatoes!

144
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:49,567
No, wait! Don't do that!

145
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,644
That'll make them think
they can come over.

146
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:53,081
So, what if they do?

147
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:58,492
We're not here to meet guys. You have
a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.

148
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:03,041
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.

149
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:07,092
You know, not everything has to go
as far as eye contact.

150
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,573
Chandler, you have to tell Joey
you're not in Tulsa.

151
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:14,367
Isn't it better for him
to think you're cheating on me...

152
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:17,252
...than for him to think
I'm cheating on him?

153
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:19,171
I heard it.

154
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,008
I don't want him to think
I'm having an affair.

155
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:25,327
All right, I've got a plan.
I'll go down the fire escape--

156
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,570
Because all good plans start with,
"I'll go down the fire escape."

157
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:30,092
Hear me out, woman!

158
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:33,804
I'll go down the fire escape and wait.

159
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:36,402
Then it'll be like I just got back
from Tulsa.

160
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:39,451
Joey and I will come in
and see that there's no guy in here.

161
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,929
Aren't you afraid that Joey's
gonna figure all this out?

162
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:47,532
I heard it.

163
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,009
-I'm gonna wait.
-The scary pigeon's back?

164
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,204
It's huge.

165
00:11:31,213 --> 00:11:34,922
I can't believe you live in that building.
My grandmother lives in that building!

166
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:37,402
Ida Greene? No sense
of personal space...

167
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,962
...kind of smells like chicken,
looks like a potato.

168
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:42,767
-"Spuds" is your grandmother?
-That's my bubbe!

169
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,766
So we're on our way
to a couple of parties.

170
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:52,084
Maybe we could get your numbers
and call if we find something fun?

171
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:55,970
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't really
looking for anything to happen...

172
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,567
...with you guys. I have a boyfriend.

173
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:00,809
-All right.
-It's no big deal.

174
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:07,045
So she has a boyfriend.
What is your situation?

175
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,843
Well, it's complicated.
I don't actually have a boyfriend, but--

176
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:13,442
Then can I have your number?

177
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:15,691
I'm sorry, no.

178
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,168
Okay.

179
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,848
Oh, sure!

180
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:24,330
Oh, my God, you're giving
your real number!

181
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:28,288
Okay, thanks. I'll give you
a call later tonight.

182
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,290
-Great.
-Bye.

183
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:31,647
Bye.

184
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,171
So that's great.

185
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,882
You, Bill, Ross and Emma are
gonna be so happy together.

186
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,406
What were you thinking?

187
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:43,889
I don't know. He was cute,
and he liked me. It was an impulse.

188
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:46,203
But what about Ross?
What about your moment?

189
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:48,329
-Don't you wanna talk to Ross about it?
-No.

190
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:51,485
No, because I know exactly
how the conversation's gonna go.

191
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:54,565
"Hey, Ross, you know, I think
we had a moment before."

192
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,884
"Yeah. Me too."

193
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:01,284
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want
to do anything about it."

194
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:04,490
"Yeah. Me neither."

195
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,245
"Should we just live together...

196
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:08,483
...and not tell each other
how we're feeling?"

197
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:11,451
"Yeah, that works for me."

198
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,964
Yeah, I see what you mean.

199
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:18,284
By the way, nice Ross imitation.

200
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:19,932
Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

201
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,532
-Well-- Hey!
-Better.

202
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,887
The point is maybe I should just stop
waiting around for moments with Ross.

203
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:31,125
You know? I should just move
on with my life.

204
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,086
So really, you're moving on from Ross?

205
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:36,483
I don't know.
Do I have to decide right now?

206
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:39,486
You kind of just did.
That guy is gonna call you tonight.

207
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,531
Ross will pick up the phone,
and that's a pretty clear message.

208
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,371
Oh, my God, Ross!

209
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,569
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

210
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:49,645
I have to get my number back.
Oh, my God, he's gone!

211
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:53,209
"Oh, I have to get my number back!
Oh, my God! He's gone!" Dead on.

212
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:10,684
-You know, I'm gonna take off.
-So soon?

213
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:12,172
-Yeah.
-Okay.

214
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,767
Well, thanks-- Thanks for the beer.

215
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:18,448
-You mean lager?
-Yeah. Good times.

216
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,603
-Hello?
-Hey, Mike, it's me.

217
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,604
Listen, is-- Is Ross near you?

218
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,292
No, I just left.

219
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:39,165
Well, you have to go back in.

220
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:44,370
What? Go back? To the land
where time stands still?

221
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,611
I'm so sorry, honey, but--

222
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,684
Okay, Rachel gave this guy
her number...

223
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:51,083
...and she doesn't want Ross
to answer the phone.

224
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:53,164
So you have to intercept all his calls.

225
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:54,802
I can't do that!

226
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,891
-He says he can't do that.
-Give me the phone.

227
00:14:58,053 --> 00:15:01,568
Hi, Mike. Hi, listen, I know that this
is a lot to ask, but you know what?

228
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:06,887
If you do this, Phoebe will do
anything you want.

229
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:11,092
-Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
-All right. Thank you. Hello?

230
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:14,962
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actually,
she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

231
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,412
All right, I'll do it.

232
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:23,087
But really, how much dirtier
can it get?

233
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,642
Oh, Mike.

234
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,448
Bye.

235
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:34,971
Hey, buddy.

236
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,932
Hi.

237
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:41,972
-Can I come back in?
-Why?

238
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:48,726
Well, I was just thinking about
how much more we have to talk about.

239
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:52,131
But you left.

240
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:58,011
That didn't take long.

241
00:15:58,213 --> 00:16:01,649
I thought you said Tulsa was,
like, a three-hour flight?

242
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:06,002
Well, you're forgetting
about the time difference.

243
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,844
Yeah.

244
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,052
Chandler, you're home!

245
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:22,650
That's right! Your husband's home!
So now the sex can stop!

246
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:28,848
What are you saying?

247
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:30,805
Joey said you're here
with another man!

248
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:34,608
There's no man in here!
How dare you accuse me of that!

249
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:42,446
All right. Then maybe you won't mind
if me and my friend take a look around.

250
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:46,642
What's he doing?

251
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:50,243
I arranged some pillows on the bed
to look like a guy.

252
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:56,449
Bedroom's clear. Although you might
need some new pillows.

253
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,645
All right, well, I'll check
the guest room.

254
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:09,129
Why do I smell men's cologne?

255
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,323
I think that's you.

256
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:19,646
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine
on myself earlier.

257
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,325
There's nobody here, Joe.

258
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,082
I guess not.

259
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:28,685
I can't believe you thought I was
cheating. You owe me an apology.

260
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,693
-You're right. I'm so sorry.
-It's an honest mistake.

261
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,889
It could happen to anybody. See you.

262
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,362
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

263
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:40,526
If you just got back from Tulsa,
how did your suitcase beat you here?

264
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:47,284
I climbed down the fire escape,
and you can't put that in the closet?

265
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,886
So, with the exception
of the fermentation process...

266
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:57,329
...beer and ale are
basically the same thing.

267
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,767
Fascinating, isn't it?

268
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,243
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

269
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,330
I'll get it!

270
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:16,047
Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.

271
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,206
It's for you.

272
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:26,170
I don't understand
what just happened here.

273
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:30,091
What's going on?

274
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:31,322
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:35,452
I told you I was in Tulsa because I
wanted to spend the night with Monica...

276
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:39,288
...and I didn't know--
I didn't think you'd understand.

277
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,962
You think I'm too dumb to understand
a husband needs to be with his wife?

278
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:47,125
You think I'm, like....

279
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,047
-Joey?
-Yeah.

280
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:55,450
I don't know what to say.
We shouldn't have lied to you.

281
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:58,764
I feel so bad. Is there anything
I can do to make it up to you?

282
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:04,364
You could go to the game with me.
Even though you said you couldn't.

283
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:08,811
But then you lied to me and tricked me
and gave me a bump on the head.

284
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:12,728
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't
do. I promised I'd be with Monica.

285
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,561
All right.

286
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:17,011
-You can go.
-What?

287
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:19,892
You should go to the game.
It's okay. I want you to.

288
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,893
-Really? You gonna be okay?
-Yeah, I'll be fine.

289
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:26,728
You know, maybe I'll stay here
and practice the art of seduction.

290
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:31,330
-You're gonna put sweats on and clean.
-It's gonna be so hot!

291
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:32,882
-Bye.
-Bye.

292
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:34,168
Thanks.

293
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:36,406
Here's your ticket.

294
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,689
Thanks. Hey, listen...

295
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:41,367
...l'm never gonna lie
to you again, okay?

296
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:44,690
And I want you to know
that nobody thinks you're stupid.

297
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,482
Thanks, man.

298
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:52,850
-Where you going?
-Game's tomorrow night, Joe.

299
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:00,726
Oh, God!

300
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:03,646
So glad you're back!

301
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,291
So, what did you guys do?

302
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:09,166
You know, we just drank some beer.

303
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,927
Mike played with the boundaries
of normal social conduct.

304
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,852
It's true, I did.

305
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:17,682
-Well, goodbye.
-Okay.

306

308
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,529
Lock the door!
Lock the door, seriously.

309
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,693
Shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe
for the drinks.

310

Wait, wait. Wait, sorry.
Did he call? Did that guy call?

No, just his mom.

00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:55,251
Bill from the bar?

318
00:20:56,453 --> 00:21:01,652
Okay, Bill from the bar,

You guys have a good time?

321
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:21,245
We had so much fun.
It felt so good to be out.

327
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,208
