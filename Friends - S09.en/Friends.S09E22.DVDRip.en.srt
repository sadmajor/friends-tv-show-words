1
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:06,528  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, that feels so good.

2
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:10,402  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, lucky me.
Coffee and a live sex show.

3
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:12,206  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm sorry, what?
-I'm sorry.

4
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:15,809  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Nothing. I was just reading to Emma.
-From Cosmo?

5
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:20,162  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:523
Yeah. Yeah, it's:

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,211  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Climax Your Way to Better Skin."

7
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:27,324  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
So I have to go shopping today,
which is my least favorite thing.

8
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:29,563  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm so bad at picking out clothes.

9
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:33,726  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
So you need someone who knows
fashion to tell you what looks good.

10
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:35,849  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not me. Not me. Not me.

11
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:38,652  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Oh, hey, Rach?
-Yeah?

12
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:42,370  X1:076 X2:643 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?
-Oh, well....

13
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,842  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm sure you have better things to do.
-You kidding?

14
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:47,607  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
Rachel loves to shop,
and she has great taste.

15
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:50,890  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
She's the one that taught me not
to wear white after Labor Day...

16
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:55,365  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and to always, always, always put
on underwear when trying on clothes.

17
00:00:57,093 --> 00:00:59,687  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you have the time,
I'd really appreciate the help.

18
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,003  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Yeah, let's shop.

19
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:06,564  X1:134 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, you are gonna come back
with some very classy clothes.

20
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,883  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!

21
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:13,451  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, great. All right, bye.

22
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:15,604  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Pain in the ass!

23
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:19,362  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:523
-That's off, right?
-What's the matter, Pheebs?

24
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:23,492  X1:077 X2:639 Y1:442 Y2:523
Mike's sister just invited me to
a party tonight and he's gonna be there.

25
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:28,010  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
She was like, "Don't worry. I asked him
and he's totally okay with seeing you."

26
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:31,848  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:442 Y2:523
So now I have to go so he'll think
that I'm totally okay with seeing him.

27
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:34,732  X1:062 X2:656 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Which you're not. You're hung up on him.
-Exactly.

28
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:38,169  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
You want him to eat his heart out,
so you have to look fabulous.

29
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,688  X1:142 X2:566 Y1:486 Y2:523
I didn't even think about that.

30
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:43,289  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
Sexual politics!

31
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:46,412  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
Pheebs, I'm taking Charlie shopping.

32
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,645  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Come and I'll help you find something.
-That'd be great.

33
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:55,126  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,
trying on slutty lingerie together.

34
00:01:56,053 --> 00:02:00,285  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:442 Y2:523
-That's not what we're gonna do.
-Why'd you ruin it? Who was I hurting?

35
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,369  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
The One With The Donor

36
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:44,409  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:054 Y2:133
Fortunately, she has
a very pretty face.

37
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:53,771  X1:105 X2:615 Y1:054 Y2:134
I still can't believe this. My uterus is
an inhospitable environment?

38
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,845  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:054 Y2:134
I've always tried so hard
to be a good hostess.

39
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,723  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:054 Y2:134
I can't believe my sperm
have low motility.

40
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:04,364  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:054 Y2:133
While I was growing up, they sure
seemed to be in a hurry to get places.

41
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:06,167  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:054 Y2:128
-Hi there.
-Hi.

42
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,291  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:054 Y2:134
I'm sorry there wasn't better news
from your tests last week...

43
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:12,092  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:054 Y2:133
...but I wanted to talk to you
about your options.

44
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:13,242  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

45
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:17,326  X1:080 X2:639 Y1:054 Y2:133
Even though your chances of conceiving
through natural means aren't great...

46
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:20,087  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:054 Y2:133
...you never know,
so keep having sex on a regular basis.

47
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:22,209  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, damn it!

48
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:27,282  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:054 Y2:134
Don't worry.
After a while, you'll tune it out.

49
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:31,608  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:054 Y2:133
Given your situation, the options
with the greatest chances for success...

50
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:35,686  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:054 Y2:133
...would be surrogacy
or insemination using a sperm donor.

51
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:42,771  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you feel that neither of those is
right for you, you could always adopt.

52
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,525  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that a hint?

53
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:50,131  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly,
but we don't want you to be our child.

54
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:57,132  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wow! Talk about
an inhospitable environment.

55
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,971  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up
Phoebe and go shopping?

56
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,647  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Let's do it.
-All right, have a good time.

57
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,283  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
Not gonna find any clothes in there.

58
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,727  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey, you guys.
-Hi.

59
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:15,603  X1:073 X2:646 Y1:442 Y2:523
Guess who's up for keynote speaker
at the National Paleontology Conference?

60
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,445  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Chris Bailey?
-Yeah, right.

61
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:22,004  X1:092 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:523
When was the last time he made
a submission deadline for an abstract?

62
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:27,047  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why are you laughing?

63
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:30,683  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:442 Y2:523
Just seeing what it'd be like
to be a paleontologist.

64
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:32,406  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's fun. Yeah.

65
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,125  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
So you're up for keynote speaker?

66
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,011  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Who's deciding?
-Professor Sherman.

67
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:40,529  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm meeting with him today.
-He's a pretty tough guy to impress.

68
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:42,729  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think I know how to dazzle him.

69
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:46,681  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're not gonna to do
a magic trick, are you?

70
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,322  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

71
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:59,407  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey, guys.
-I want to ask you something.

72
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:02,645  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
I may get to speak
at this paleontology convention.

73
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:06,123  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:523
If I do, I'd love for you guys
to come and hear me.

74
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:11,162  X1:085 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think I can safely say that we all have
family issues, work and/or are sick.

75
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:14,564  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:442 Y2:523
-It's in Barbados.
-But you come first.

76
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:16,166  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm there.

77
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,327  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:442 Y2:523
-We'll see you guys.
-Bye.

78
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:19,482  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:482 Y2:523
See you.

79
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:25,568  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
-Not as much fun as last time.

80
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:29,043  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
Apparently, you only get porn
if you're giving a sperm sample.

81
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:31,652  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, what did the doctor say?

82
00:05:31,813 --> 00:05:35,362  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt
her whole life of carrying a child...

83
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:39,287  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and she just felt that watching
a surrogate would be too hard for her.

84
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:41,569  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So you're ruling out surrogacy?
-Yeah.

85
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,644  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:523
So I don't have to learn
what that means?

86
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:47,726  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:523
Aside from adoption, the only
other choice is insemination...

87
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:49,849  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:482 Y2:523
...so we're talking about sperm donors.

88
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:53,562  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:442 Y2:523
Enough said. I'm there for you, man.
Where is she, upstairs?

89
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:57,451  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
How do you feel about all this?

90
00:05:57,613 --> 00:06:02,403  X1:097 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:523
I wish there was an easier way for us
to have a child, but there isn't one.

91
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:06,209  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
Step up and do it.

92
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:08,282  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

93
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:13,565  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
What?! No!
I'm not gonna give them Ben!

94
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:22,450  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:442 Y2:523
The data we're receiving
from MRI scans and DNA testing...

95
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:24,569  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
...of these fossils are staggering.

96
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:28,965  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, we've been accepting
Leakey's dates as a given.

97
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:32,091  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
But if they're off
by even a 100,000 years or so...

98
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:35,928  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
...then you can just throw
most of our assumptions...

99
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,288  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
...you know, right in the trash.

100
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:42,366  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, what I'm saying is....

101
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:44,285  X1:283 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that....

102
00:06:44,573 --> 00:06:49,089  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
Is that repercussions could be huge.

103
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:52,848  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, not just in paleontology,
but if you think about it...

104
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:57,052  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
...in evolutionary biology,
genetics, geology.

105
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:59,727  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
I mean, truly, the mind boggles.

106
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:05,962  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, that's not what you want.

107
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,201  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Incentive for Men?
-I'll take some of that.

108
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:14,965  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Pheebs, that's for men.
-I know.

109
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,691  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
When I go to the party later...

110
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,687  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
...Mike will know I'm over him
because I'll smell like another guy.

111
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:23,882  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

112
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:27,405  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, good, I'm dating
a Russian cabdriver.

113
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:31,642  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:523
Seriously, does anyone buy this?
I smell like beets.

114
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:37,971  X1:075 X2:644 Y1:444 Y2:523
I really like those jackets with the
shoulder pads in them. Where are those?

115
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:41,205  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
On Melanie Griffith in Working Girl.

116
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,933  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think what you want is over here.

117
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,813  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
See, I told you I needed someone.

118
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:51,204  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
By the way, as a thank you,
I would really love to take you out.

119
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:54,490  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Really?
-Joey and I are going to a movie tonight.

120
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:56,803  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:446 Y2:523
-You want to come?
-Oh, I can't.

121
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:59,847  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:486 Y2:523
Because I've seen them.

122
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,368  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:486 Y2:523
You've seen all the movies?

123
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:07,684  X1:208 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah. I'm a big fan.

124
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:09,247  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:488 Y2:523
Of the movies.

125
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:11,449  X1:156 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know, motion pictures.

126
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:12,932  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:523
The talkies.

127
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,162  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Rach, will you come with me
to a dressing room?

128
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,322  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Sure.
-Okay.

129
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:20,324  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe we could do something else.

130
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:24,771  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know, that depends on what it is.
I've done a lot of stuff.

131
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:36,410  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
So, what were you doing out there?
Do you not like Charlie?

132
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:40,361  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:442 Y2:523
She's okay. I don't know, I just don't
get a really good vibe from her.

133
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,763  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Why?
-I don't know.

134
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:47,848  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know, just the way
she waltzed in here all smart...

135
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:49,606  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and tall, you know...

136
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:53,129  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and just swept Joey off his feet.
Nobody else has a chance.

137
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:54,602  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who else?

138
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:56,402  X1:277 X2:429 Y1:482 Y2:523
Anybody.

139
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,442  X1:309 X2:398 Y1:488 Y2:523
You.

140
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,202  X1:316 X2:392 Y1:488 Y2:523
Me.

141
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,608  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:523
You know, Monica's mom.

142
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:06,166  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
You like Joey?!

143
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,368  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:523
Phoebe!

144
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:11,811  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, look, I do.
I have a little thing for him. Just--

145
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,484  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, my God.
-It's just physical.

146
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:18,931  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have it totally under control, okay?
It's just when I see them together...

147
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:22,130  X1:091 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
...sometimes, I just get a little jealous.

148
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:25,808  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:442 Y2:523
Wow. Isn't that ironic
that he liked you, and now you like--?

149
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:27,406  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:482 Y2:523
I get it!

150
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:30,683  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:523
All right, as long
as it's under control.

151
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:33,765  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:442 Y2:523
You can't do anything about it.
He's already dating her.

152
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,288  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
She is a nice person.
That wouldn't be right.

153
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:38,887  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know, I know.
So it's just not a big deal.

154
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:41,203  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So can we keep this between us?
-Sure.

155
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,332  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
Great, because I gotta get out of here.
The smell of beets is killing me.

156
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:54,044  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?

157
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:00,282  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.

158
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:03,411  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:523
I brought a friend home for dinner.
This is Zack from work.

159
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,724  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, of course. It's so nice
to see you again, Zack.

160
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:09,453  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You too.
-You guys haven't actually met before.

161
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,410  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
But, boy, you're both polite.

162
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:13,484  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Have a seat. I'll get you a beer.

163
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:14,881  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I got it.
-Thanks.

164
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:21,888  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:442 Y2:523
-So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
-Yeah, I guess.

165
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:26,042  X1:092 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
So how would you like to have a baby
that's half yours and half his?

166
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:30,842  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse me?

167
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:34,323  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:442 Y2:523
We're talking about sperm donors,
and Zack may be the guy.

168
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:39,328  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:442 Y2:523
Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
he's athletic. I mean, he's sperm-tastic!

169
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:45,002  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
Chandler, this is crazy.
Well, what did you even say to him?

170
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:48,324  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Come up. Meet my wife.
Give us your sperm."

171
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:52,050  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:442 Y2:523
I invited him to dinner so you'd get
a chance to get to know him.

172
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:55,330  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
With a sperm bank, you never
meet the guy, get to check him out.

173
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:57,802  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Chandler!
-I'm telling you, he's great.

174
00:10:57,973 --> 00:11:01,966  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
I think he'd be the way to go.

175
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,289  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm not going to be a part of this.

176
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:09,605  X1:081 X2:638 Y1:442 Y2:523
You can't bring some random guy home
and expect him to be our sperm donor.

177
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:10,762  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

178
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:14,285  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Zack?
-Thanks.

179
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:17,691  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you have a coaster?
I don't want to make a ring.

180
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:19,923  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Tell me about yourself, Zack.

181
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:27,609  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, God, do you think she heard?
lt'd be so bad if she heard.

182
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:31,686  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
Maybe she didn't hear. I'll go into that
dressing room and talk. You stay here.

183
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:33,730  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
-See if you can hear me.
-Okay, great.

184
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,684  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, thank God,
I can't hear a word that you're saying.

185
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:44,290  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I didn't say anything yet.
-Well, get back in there and talk.

186
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:46,562  X1:266 X2:441 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm Rachel.

187
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:50,362  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's so annoying when I put Emma
on the phone to talk with my friends.

188
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:51,762  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

189
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:55,246  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, some things are just hard
to say to your face.

190
00:11:56,653 --> 00:12:00,532  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, well, I heard that.
Which means that she heard it too.

191
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:04,488  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
-We have a problem.
-Oh, what are we gonna do?

192
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:06,405  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just be honest with her.

193
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,292  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

194
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:10,683  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
It is annoying when parents
put babies on the phone.

195
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,764  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, enough out of you!

196
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,882  X1:091 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hello?
-I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?

197
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:25,772  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, she went shopping with Rachel.
Why? What's up?

198
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:29,721  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm meeting with Professor Sherman
about my being the keynote speaker.

199
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:32,168  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:523
-How's it going?
-It could be better.

200
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:36,286  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
He fell asleep.

201
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:39,331  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
What? But I already bought
my ticket to Bermuda!

202
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,366  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Barbados.
-Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.

203
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:46,526  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
You have to get that job.

204
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:48,888  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:523
What am I supposed to do?
He's out cold.

205
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:51,647  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
In fact, he was just talking
in his sleep before...

206
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:56,011  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and evidently he wants someone
named Fran to "spank him harder."

207
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,323  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well, just wake him up.
-I can't.

208
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:04,009  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
If he realizes that I'm the one who
put him to sleep, I won't get the job.

209
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:05,288  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's a tough one.

210
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:08,251  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, wait a minute.
This happened to me before.

211
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:13,441  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, I was auditioning for a play,
and the producer fell asleep. l--

212
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:15,649  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:486 Y2:523
No, wait a minute.

213
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:17,326  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
It was me who fell asleep.

214
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:22,166  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:523
I mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about
a chase scene once in a while?

215
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:28,563  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
-I'm gonna go wash up first.

216
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:29,722  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks.

217
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:37,244  X1:061 X2:655 Y1:444 Y2:523
What do you think? I want his genes
for my kid. Those eyes, those cheekbones.

218
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:40,850  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay, there's enthusiastic,
and there's just plain gay.

219
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,963  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You don't like him.
-I think he's fine.

220
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:47,283  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:442 Y2:523
But we don't know
anything real about him.

221
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:51,605  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I wish we could get more information.
-All right, just follow my lead.

222
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,763  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You guys have a great place here.
-Thanks. I'm crazy about our place.

223
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,651  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, speaking of crazy...

224
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,569  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
...do you have a history
of mental illness in the family?

225
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:07,889  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:523
No. Although, I did have an uncle
who voted for Dukakis.

226
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:11,331  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's really not the kind of thing
we're looking for.

227
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,882  X1:302 X2:405 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

228
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:17,926  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
So tell me, how'd you guys meet?

229
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:21,244  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, friends first, drunk in London,
you know the story.

230
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,051  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
I've got a better question for you:

231
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:26,605  X1:101 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:523
Do you or any of your blood relatives
have diabetes?

232
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:29,922  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

233
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,769  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:486 Y2:523
Heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?

234
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:38,612  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:523
You guys don't have people
for dinner a lot, huh?

235
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:41,049  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're just making conversation.

236
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,523  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, well, okay.
I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny.

237
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:47,332  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know what's not funny?
Male pattern baldness.

238
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:54,409  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
You guys have shown a lot of interest
in me tonight, and I'm flattered...

239
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:56,768  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and quite frankly, a little frightened.

240
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,130  X1:086 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can we just talk about something else?

241
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:00,646  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Sure.
-All right.

242
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:02,607  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:486 Y2:523
This ravioli's delicious.

243
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:06,852  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:523
I notice you're enjoying that ravioli
with a beautiful set of teeth.

244
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:08,810  X1:138 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
Did you have braces as a child?

245
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:11,328  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No, I didn't.
-Yes!

246
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:16,642  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're teeth people, Zack.

247
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,809  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:523
Let's just do it. Let's just go
over there and see if she heard.

248
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:26,042  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Good plan.
-Okay.

249
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:30,568  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What? Where are you going?
-Oh, I'm sorry, Rachel.

250
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:33,930  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't have time
for your childish games, okay?

251
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:36,561  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:523
I still have to find something
incredible to wear...

252
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:39,611  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
...so I can beat Mike
at "Who's More Over Who" !

253
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,368  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Where have you been?
-Trying on clothes.

254
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:53,163  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:523
Oh, really? In the dressing room?
Well, that's so weird.

255
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:58,361  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
Phoebe and I were in the dressing room.
Gosh, it's just such a small world.

256
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,967  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
Rachel, I heard you
two guys whispering.

257
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:04,125  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, God, you did, you heard.
Okay, look, let me explain.

258
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:06,204  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:442 Y2:523
There's nothing to explain.
I heard you.

259
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:07,647  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe likes Joey.

260
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:13,402  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

261
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:18,086  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't understand it.
I mean, Phoebe likes Joey...

262
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:21,086  X1:102 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and then she's here to buy a dress
to impress another guy?

263
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:25,849  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah, that's Phoebe. That's Phoebe.
You know, she just wants them all.

264
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:28,766  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's, like, she's nympho.

265
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,481  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Wow!
-Yeah.

266
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:35,328  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, by the way, I heard you
tell her not to do anything.

267
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:39,645  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thanks for sticking up for me.
God, you are such a nice person.

268
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:41,922  X1:313 X2:404 Y1:482 Y2:523
I try.

269
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:23,242  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God, you really want me
to be the keynote speaker?

270
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:25,771  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you!

271
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:29,571  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:486 Y2:523
You're welcome.

272
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,644  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow! You look...

273
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,683  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
...stop-eating hot!

274
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,807  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
Which is like the highest level
of hotness.

275
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:55,125  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, are you sure? Because I am
really dreading going to this party.

276
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:56,282  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
Then don't go.

277
00:17:56,453 --> 00:18:00,048  X1:067 X2:649 Y1:442 Y2:523
Mike knows I'm coming. If I don't
show up, he'll think it's because of him...

278
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:04,809  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and then I'm gonna lose face.
That's a very serious thing in my culture.

279
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:10,204  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, then you go to that party,
and you pretend to be over Mike.

280
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:13,763  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
Afterward, you come to my place
and I'll get you good and drunk.

281
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,605  X1:225 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
You got it. Okay.

282
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:18,207  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
But not on the wine
that you made, okay?

283
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:22,127  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
Because I just don't want to go back
to the emergency room.

284
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:32,726  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:488 Y2:523
David?

285
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:34,406  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:523
Phoebe! Hi.

286
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,882  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Oh, my God!
-Hi.

287
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,763  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow! You look unbelievable.

288
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,605  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, yeah, well....

289
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:45,092  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you doing here?

290
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:48,086  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I'm back from Minsk.
Permanently.

291
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,402  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, what happened?

292
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,325  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
Remember how I was trying
to achieve...

293
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:54,246  X1:169 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
...the positronic distillation
of subatomic particles?

294
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,812  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

295
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:59,363  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, after eight years of research,
I discovered...

296
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,922  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:486 Y2:523
...that it can't be done.

297
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:03,722  X1:301 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well...

298
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:07,087  X1:084 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:523
...great that you're back. How are you?

299
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:09,050  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Good. Good. Life is good.
-Good.

300
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,488  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, I'm seeing someone.

301
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,566  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Good for you.
-Yeah.

302
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:18,931  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
She's also a scientist,
so she's very smart and pretty and....

303
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:21,448  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's actually because of you
that we're together.

304
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:24,366  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, I saw what you had
with that Mike guy...

305
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,524  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and I just said, "Boy, I want that."

306
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,886  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Mike and I broke up.
-You're kidding me.

307
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:34,012  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
Because I'm not seeing anybody.
I just totally made that up.

308
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,129  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Really?
-I don't know why, I'm sorry.

309
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:38,807  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:523
I guess I just didn't want
to lose face.

310
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:41,129  X1:254 X2:454 Y1:488 Y2:523
I understand.

311
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,570  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah. Okay. So then, okay....

312
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:48,487  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:442 Y2:523
So we're both living in New York,
not seeing anyone.

313
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,803  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:523
-That's so not like us.
-Yeah, I know.

314
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:55,330  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, this is probably a stupid question,
seeing that you look like that...

315
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:58,246  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but do you have someplace
that you need to be right now?

316
00:19:58,413 --> 00:19:59,402  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well....

317
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:01,642  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

318
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,365  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well, do you want to get a drink?
-I'd love to.

319
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,410  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Great.
-Okay.

320
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:13,203  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do you smell beets?

321
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:16,012  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, stay upwind of me.

322
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,728  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hey, there's Phoebe.
Is that Mike she's with?

323
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:24,323  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, that's David.

324
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:27,132  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
There's a third guy?

325
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,645  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
Tip of the iceberg.

326
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,766  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm gonna take off now.

327
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,367  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're gonna let me go home,
aren't you?

328
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:39,804  X1:158 X2:562 Y1:442 Y2:523
Sure you don't want to stay
a little longer?

329
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,009  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, I should get home.
I'm kind of tired.

330
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:43,811  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you always tired?

331
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:46,726  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because that could be
a sign of clinical depression.

332
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:51,002  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, it's tiring to figure out the age
at which all my grandparents died.

333
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:54,804  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

334
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:55,962  X1:317 X2:401 Y1:482 Y2:523
Bye.

335
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:59,443  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think we found our sperm.

336
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:01,892  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
He does seem pretty perfect.

337
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,328  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yeah? You think so?
Should I ask him?

338
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:07,882  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

339
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:10,567  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why not? Just because his
great-grandmother was obese?

340
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,293  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
Our kid's gonna get that
from you anyway.

341
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:17,449  X1:228 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, that's not it.

342
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:21,891  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's just that when we were asking him
all those questions before...

343
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:26,763  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:442 Y2:523
...I just realized I don't care if he
is the most perfect guy in the world.

344
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:30,448  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:446 Y2:523
-He's not you.
-Yeah, he's better!

345
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:34,129  X1:253 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, he's not.

346
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,445  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:442 Y2:523
If I can't get pregnant with you, then
I don't want to get pregnant by him...

347
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:40,126  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
...or anyone else.

348
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:44,809  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Really? Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

349
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:47,282  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:523
Thank God, because I
don't wanna do this either.

350
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:50,525  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was just doing it because I thought
that was what you wanted.

351
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:54,129  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm the husband.
I'm supposed to bring the sperm.

352
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,771  X1:225 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:523
That is so sweet.

353
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:58,927  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you.

354
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:04,449  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
So you know this leaves us with....

355
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:06,162  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
Adoption.

356
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,765  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
How do you feel about that?

357
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:12,687  X1:164 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think I feel okay about it.

358
00:22:13,053 --> 00:22:16,363  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:523
Actually, I think I feel
really good about it.

359
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:18,442  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Me too.

360
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:23,165  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
I wanna find a baby that needs a home,
and I wanna raise it with you.

361
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,882  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
And I wanna mess it up
in our own specific way.

362
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:31,724  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
So this is it?
We're really gonna adopt?

363
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:33,482  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

364
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:38,291  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!
-We are gonna be great parents.

365
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:39,647  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:488 Y2:523
And it could be soon.

366
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:42,850  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, think about it.
Right now, somewhere out there...

367
00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:45,562  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
...our baby could be being conceived.

368
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:50,090  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
Wait. If we're lucky,
and we're really, really, really quiet...

369
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:53,768  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
...we may be able to hear
the sound of a condom breaking.

370
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,288  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:054 Y2:094
Hey, Zack.

371
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:02,523  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:054 Y2:094
Hey, Chandler.

372
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,445  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:054 Y2:094
I wanted to apologize for last night.

373
00:23:04,613 --> 00:23:06,888  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:054 Y2:133
I got the feeling
we made you uncomfortable.

374
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,168  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:054 Y2:134
-No, you didn't.
-Really?

375
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,971  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:054 Y2:094
No, you did.

376
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,693  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:054 Y2:133
My wife and I have
some boundary issues.

377
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,889  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:054 Y2:133
Sometimes we ask
inappropriate questions.

378
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:16,566  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:054 Y2:095
We're working on it.

379
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:19,930  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:054 Y2:134
-Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.
-Thank you.

380
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:25,642  X1:068 X2:649 Y1:054 Y2:134
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning
on keeping her baby, would you?

381
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,482  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:054 Y2:133
