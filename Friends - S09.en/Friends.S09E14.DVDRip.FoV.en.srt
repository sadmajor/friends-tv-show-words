1
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:05,964
-Morning, roomie.
-Hey!

2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:09,842
You remembered
to put clothes on this morning.

3
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:12,402
Fifth day's a charm.

4
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:17,733
It's so great to be back here. You're
making it so easy on me and Emma.

5
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:20,731
It's great having you back.
Stay as long as you want.

6
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:24,568
And when does she stop
crying all night?

7
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:30,042
Hey! You're not naked.

8
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:32,608
Rach, when will we expect
to see you tonight?

9
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:36,482
Probably around 6. But she's
in the bedroom, all ready to go.

10
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,371
But she fell back to sleep, so....

11
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:42,452
She's probably exhausted from all that
adorable screaming she did last night.

12
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,041
-Bye.
-Bye.

13
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:47,326
Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it
too hard on you.

14
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:49,563
No, hey, it's been great.

15
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:52,492
I just want you to know that
with Rachel staying here...

16
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,725
...all my feelings from before
are totally over.

17
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:57,167
And even if they weren't...

18
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,688
...when you walk in
on a woman using a breast pump....

19
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,282
-Yeah, that'll do it.
-Wow!

20
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,690
So how are you?

21
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:06,809
-I'm okay.
-Really?

22
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:10,966
Sure. I mean, do I wish me and Rachel
living together would have worked out?

23
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:14,808
Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,
but it's not like it's a divorce.

24
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:19,325
-Well, actually it--
-It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!

25
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:24,291
Anyway, I think Rachel and I
need to get on with our lives.

26
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:26,762
Maybe start seeing other people.

27
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:29,371
Wow. Really?

28
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:32,883
Sure, why not? In fact, if you know
anyone that'd be good for me...?

29
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,011
-Sure. I know lots of girls.
-Any names come to mind?

30
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:38,372
Names?

31
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:45,404
The One With the Blind Date

32
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:23,371
-I was about to eat. Want something?
-What you got?

33
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:27,003
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,
strained carrots...

34
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:29,733
...strained plums.
We haven't tried that yet!

35
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,127
Goody!

36
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,042
Thanks.

37
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:37,167
So how is it living with Rachel again?

38
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,847
I mean, apart from the great food?

39
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:41,805
I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just....

40
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:44,362
It's just weird what's happening
with her and Ross.

41
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,922
Yesterday he asked me to fix him up
with somebody.

42
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,522
Rachel asked me
if I knew anyone for her too.

43
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:51,689
-Why are they doing this?
-I don't know.

44
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:54,123
They're so perfect for each other.
It's crazy.

45
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,369
You know what's crazy? These jars.

46
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:00,128
What is there, like, two bites in here?

47
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,653
I just wish they'd realize
they should be together.

48
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:08,169
When they moved in together, I
figured that's where things were headed.

49
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:11,445
They should be a family. They should
marry and have more children.

50
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:15,805
Yes. And they should name
one of their kids Joey.

51
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:19,289
I may not have kids. Someone's
got to carry on the family name.

52
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:24,849
You know what? Maybe once they
start dating and see what's out there...

53
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,607
...they'll realize how good
they are for each other.

54
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:30,486
Yeah, because it is slim pickings.

55
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:33,611
I had this date last night. Yuck!

56
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:37,209
But we should probably keep it down,
she's still in the bedroom.

57
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:42,164
So, what are we gonna do? Are we
just gonna set them up with people?

58
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:45,888
I know, that just pushes them
further and further apart.

59
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:49,523
I know what we can do. We could set
Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...

60
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:52,127
...so they'll realize
how good they are together.

61
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,324
-That's a great plan.
-Yeah.

62
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:58,651
You know what the best part of it is?
I get to do my plan laugh.

63
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,771
Okay, shh! Not so loud.
We don't want to wake up....

64
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:23,364
Hi. You guys aren't
doing anything tonight, are you?

65
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:26,929
See, now, why would you assume that?
Just because we're married?

66
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:31,649
I mean, I will have you know
that we are very hip, happening people.

67
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,806
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to
get back to reading the obituaries.

68
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:39,451
I was just asking because I need
someone to watch Emma tonight.

69
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,325
Sure we'll do it.
What are you up to?

70
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,411
-Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
-Oh, my God.

71
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:48,486
-Why? What's the big deal?
-I figured because you and Ross are--

72
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:52,566
What? Slept together a year
and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.

73
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:57,045
I think it's great you're going on a date.
It sounds healthy.

74
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,762
I mean, you have needs.
Embrace your womanhood.

75
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:04,803
You want a job? Turn off Oprah
and send out a résumé.

76
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:09,567
-I'll bring her by around 7, okay?
-That's perfect.

77
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:13,043
You guys are gonna have so much fun.
She's at such a cute age.

78
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,728
A couple things. Now that she eats
solid food, she poops around the clock.

79
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:19,566
And watch out for your hair
because she likes to grab it.

80
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:24,011
She's also in this phase where if you
leave the room, she screams, but....

81
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:26,050
Thanks, you guys. Have fun.

82
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:32,565
Suddenly I wish I was reading
my own name.

83
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:37,491
Joey, hey. I'm so excited.

84
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:41,248
-I set Rachel up with the worst guy.
-All right. Who is he?

85
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:43,648
It's a guy I used to massage.
By "massage" ...

86
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:47,692
...I mean hold down so he wouldn't
turn over and flash me.

87
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:51,402
-Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
-Oh, yeah.

88
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:56,601
Okay. She's this really boring woman.
She's a teacher.

89
00:05:57,413 --> 00:06:01,452
-A teacher?
-She's into history and foreign movies.

90
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:03,524
And she loves puzzles.

91
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,649
Come on, who loves puzzles?

92
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,485
Well, Ross does.

93
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,923
You're ruining the plan!

94
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:15,130
Joey, you fixed him up
with his perfect woman.

95
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,085
-Oh, my God, you're right!
-Yeah.

96
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,972
She even reads for pleasure!

97
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:25,291
-How do you know a woman like that?
-I'm not allowed to know smart women?

98
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:29,082
-Joey?
-We met at the library. I went in to pee.

99
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:33,852
-So now what do we do?
-Well, okay.

100
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:37,767
I'll call her and tell her the date's
canceled and find him somebody else.

101
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:42,968
What if we don't find him somebody
else? We'll just tell her the date's off...

102
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:47,331
...but we don't tell Ross. He'll go
to the restaurant and get stood up.

103
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:50,446
I hear that's bad.

104
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:53,765
So this is great. Rachel's
gonna have a terrible date...

105
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:57,767
...Ross gets stood up, and then they'll
realize how good they have it together.

106
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:59,611
Yes, the plan.

107
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,252
It's not Santa's plan.

108
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,884
No, it's....

109
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:17,845
-Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
-No, I think we killed it.

110
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,172
Emma? Emma, look at me!

111
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:26,930
Well, I think I'll go downstairs
for a while.

112
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:35,646
No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay!
I didn't go!

113
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:37,963
Don't cry, it's just a bit!

114
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:41,682
I'm your uncle Chandler.
Funny is all I have!

115
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:46,166
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be
ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.

116
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:49,410
So don't touch yourself
for the next 48 hours.

117
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:52,449
I don't do that.

118
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:55,247
I'll try to stop.

119
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,564
-Did you say until the 6th?
-Yeah.

120
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,325
Today is the 6th.

121
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:01,529
No, it's not.

122
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,245
Yes, it's also 2003.

123
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,887
Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?

124
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,805
I may be done ovulating!

125
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:14,171
I may have also served some very
questionable meat at the restaurant.

126
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:17,246
-Go take the test, see if we're okay.
-Okay.

127
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:26,248
Tough crib.

128
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:30,372
Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?
There's only one here.

129
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:36,691
I might have checked to see
if I was ovulating a couple times.

130
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:41,885
I'm not working! There's not much
to do around here!

131
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:56,243
Excuse me.

132
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:59,610
Is there a woman waiting at the bar?

133
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:04,289
Someone average height, dark hair?
Or perhaps doing a puzzle?

134
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,326
There's a drunk Chinese guy.

135
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,769
Well, if I'm still here in an hour,
buy him a drink on me.

136
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,131
Can I get you another glass of wine?

137
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:17,603
I don't know if I should.
I don't want to be drunk when I...

138
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,923
...go home alone tonight.

139
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:24,966
-Got stood up, huh?
-It's no big deal. It's just a blind date.

140
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:28,643
Are you worried your date came,
saw you and left?

141
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,962
No!

142
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:36,964
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.

143
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:41,530
Oh, good, because as of 4:00
this afternoon, I am not.

144
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:45,247
So let's do this.

145
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,762
-I don't think I can.
-Oh, come on.

146
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:51,528
I know you're not 18 anymore,
but give it a minute.

147
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:55,685
-Because of Emma.
-Oh, my God, Emma.

148
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:58,572
Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.

149
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:01,566
You're right, we can't do this.
We can't leave her alone.

150
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,485
Sorry.

151
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:05,531
Unless...

152
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,923
...maybe we do it here.

153
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:10,971
I mean, how much can she even
be aware of at this age?

154
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:15,052
She's aware when we leave a room.
She may notice if we start...

155
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,090
...canoodling in it.

156
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,001
-Canoodling?
-Well, I can't say hump or screw...

157
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:23,164
...in front of the B-A-B-Y.

158
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:27,612
I don't know,
I guess having sex in front of a baby...

159
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:30,810
-...isn't so....
-Horrifying? Scarring?

160
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:33,487
Something people go to jail for?

161
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:37,085
-I guess you're right.
-You guess?

162
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:39,448
At that bed-and-breakfast,
we didn't have sex...

163
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:42,525
...because you thought a deer
was staring through the window.

164
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:46,368
Well, what kind of a sick bastard
wants to do it in front of a deer?

165
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:55,848
Wow, everything looks so good.

166
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:58,846
I think I'm gonna have the chicken.

167
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,927
I just have to say this.

168
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:09,167
-You're really beautiful.
-Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.

169
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,369
I'm kind of funny-looking.

170
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:16,049
-What?
-Look, I mean, come on...

171
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:19,962
...you're way out of my league.
Everybody in here knows it.

172
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:22,328
I bet that guy over there
is probably saying:

173
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:25,166
"Why's she out with him?
He must be rich."

174
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:29,009
Well, I'm not.

175
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:33,523
What do you think you want to order?
I'm real excited about that chicken.

176
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,725
I'm not funny, either.

177
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:40,010
So if you were thinking,
"Well, he's not that good-looking...

178
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:44,212
...but maybe we'll have some laughs, "
that ain't gonna happen.

179
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:49,844
Well, come on, Steve,
let's not rule out nervous laughter.

180
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:54,492
Hey, now, wait a minute,
Phoebe told me...

181
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,645
...that you owned your own restaurant.
That's impressive.

182
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:01,886
I lost it to drugs.

183
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:08,249
I silk-screen T-shirts now.

184
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:11,843
Really?
What's that like?

185
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:15,728
It's really fulfilling doing something
you hate for no money.

186
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:20,562
That's right. I have no money,
I'm not funny...

187
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:26,012
...I live in a studio apartment
with two other guys.

188
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:30,724
And I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.

189
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,289
Now, come on. Come on, Steve.

190
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:39,729
There must be something
that you like about yourself.

191
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,403
I do like my hair.

192
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,848
Really?

193
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,332
-Hello?
-Phoebe, it's me!

194
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:04,607
I'm going to hunt you down
and kill you.

195
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:08,768
Hey, Rach!

196
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:12,961
This is the worst date ever! How could
you set me up with this creep?

197
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:16,165
You know, you are talking about
one of my dear, dear friends.

198
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:19,092
I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.

199
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:21,853
All right, so he gets a little crazy
when he's stoned.

200
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:26,926
-He's not stoned.
-Did he go out for a cigarette?

201
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:30,286
-Yeah. Four times.
-My dear, sweet Rach.

202
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:36,770
Well, our plan is working.
Rachel's having a miserable time...

203
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:39,851
...and Ross is stood up somewhere
at a restaurant all alone.

204
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,964
Pretty soon they'll be back together.

205
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:46,928
By the time anyone's figured out what
we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.

206
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:51,563
Oh, wait, that's the end
of a different plan.

207
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,567
She's asleep. Chandler?

208
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:00,807
-What are you doing?
-Emma was doing it.

209
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,686
She's asleep.

210
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:08,370
-She's asleep. That means we can....
-Yes. But we have to be fast.

211
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:11,127
Oh, okay, I'll try.

212
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,405
-And you can't make any noise.
-Okay, I'll try.

213
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:23,403
Hello?

214
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:27,243
Emma?

215
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:31,965
Hey! Hi!

216
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,892
How are you? How are you?

217
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:39,011
Where are your babysitters, huh?

218
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:42,365
Why is the bedroom door closed?

219
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:52,972
You can't have S-E-X
when you're taking care of a B-A-B-l-E.

220
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:02,051
I've got bad news.
The Chinese guy left.

221
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:06,411
If it was meant to be, it's meant to be.

222
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:08,365
Look, you got stood up. Who cares?

223
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,331
We're gonna show you a good time.
Sit and relax.

224
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,042
In fact, let me bring you
a crab-cake appetizer on the house.

225
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:18,849
Wow, free crab cakes?
Well, that's nice.

226
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:23,092
Although I was hoping
to have sex tonight.

227
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:30,887
Just the crab cakes.

228
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:34,409
What are you doing? Are you trying
to get him to stay? You can't do that.

229
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:38,248
-Just get out of here, okay?
-I'm sorry, what's going on?

230
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:41,770
Okay, the waiters have
a little pool going.

231
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:46,324
We have a bet on how long it'll take
before you give up and go home.

232
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:50,082
What?!

233
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:53,245
You're making money off my misery?

234
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,013
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.

235
00:15:56,213 --> 00:16:00,570
This is unbelievable. I have never
been so insulted in my life.

236
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:04,408
Now, if you'll wrap up my free
crab cakes, I'll be on my way.

237
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:11,286
Well, that was weird.
You were loud and I was fast.

238
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:13,887
I think we may have
really done it this time.

239
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,965
I wish I didn't have to wait
to take a pregnancy test.

240
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,328
You may want to get
some more of those too.

241
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:23,212
Where's Emma?

242
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,887
Oh, my God, where's Emma?
Where's Emma?

243
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:29,369
Don't ask me.
I was in there canoodling you.

244
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:33,569
Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Rachel
came home early and picked up Emma.

245
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,645
You go look across the hall,
and I'll call her cell.

246
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:38,252
You better hope we're pregnant...

247
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:42,201
...because one way or another,
we're giving a baby back to Rachel!

248
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,411
I can't believe I'm crying
in front of you.

249
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,643
You must think I'm so pathetic.

250
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:53,011
No, no, no, I admire a man
who can cry.

251
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:56,449
-Really?
-Don't touch my coat.

252
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,202
Sorry, that's my phone.

253
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:02,682
-Hello?
-Hey, Rach, how's it going?

254
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:05,691
Oh, my God,
this is the worst date ever.

255
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:08,922
Oh, come on.

256
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:13,052
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did
you really think that this was going well?

257
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,122
-What's up?
-Hey, did you stop by here?

258
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:21,683
-No.
-Oh, my God! Then....

259
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:25,004
Thank God! Emma, there you are!

260
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:30,246
What? What do you mean,
"there you are"? Where was she?

261
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:35,847
We were playing peekaboo.
She loves it when I'm dramatic.

262
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:43,047
-Why the hell did you take her?
-Because you two were having sex!

263
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:48,210
-No, we weren't.
-Don't you lie to me.

264
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:52,412
I can tell by Chandler's hair. You are
so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?

265
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:59,205
All right. All right, we were.

266
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:01,933
We're trying to make a baby.
Monica's ovulating.

267
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:05,005
It's unacceptable that you'd
have sex with Emma in the next room.

268
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:08,643
-I'll have to tell Rachel about this.
-Please don't. She will kill us.

269
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:11,486
Hey, I gotta. Unless....

270
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:13,126
Unless what?

271
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,012
Unless you name
your first-born child Joey.

272
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,647
-What? Why?
-Hey, I may never have kids...

273
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:23,202
...and somebody's gotta
carry on my family name.

274
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:27,572
Your family name is Tribbiani.

275
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,211
You almost had me.

276
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,052
Look...

277
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,325
...I think I know the answer
to this question, but...

278
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:52,048
...would you like to make love to me?

279
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:00,291
Really, really not.

280
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:03,209
It's just as well.

281
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,728
It doesn't work anyway.

282
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:17,163
All right, well, that's good to know.
Good night, Steve.

283
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:29,366
-Hey, what's wrong?
-I just had a rough night.

284
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:31,611
Crab cake?

285
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:34,965
Well, what happened?

286
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,812
This is kind of weird
to talk to you about this, but--

287
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:39,964
Monica told me you had a blind date.

288
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,886
-Yeah.
-I did too.

289
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:47,092
But is it technically a date
if the other person doesn't show up?

290
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:52,202
Oh, no. Do you think she walked in,
saw you and left?

291
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:57,922
Why does everyone keep saying that?

292
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:02,009
If it makes you feel any better,
I wish my date hadn't shown up.

293
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:05,011
-That bad?
-Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...

294
00:20:05,173 --> 00:20:08,609
...and he thought it would be
appropriate to give me...

295
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,766
...this.

296
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:15,212
"Female Body Inspector"?

297
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:18,727
What size is that?

298
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:23,403
Now wait a minute. So they're gonna
name their first child Joey?

299
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:26,167
How do I get them to name
the next one after me?

300
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,211
It's easy. You just
walk in on them having sex.

301
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:33,205
Oh, so they owe me,
like, three Phoebes.

302
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:36,726
Oh, my God!
Look, it's Ross and Rachel!

303
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,525
The plan is working!

304
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,287
Don't do the plan laugh.

305
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:47,206
The first dates we've had in months,
and they were both such disasters.

306
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:51,124
You know, it is weird...

307
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:55,571
...that Phoebe would set me up
on a date that was awful...

308
00:20:55,733 --> 00:21:00,124
...on the same night Joey set you up
on a date that didn't even show.

309
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:03,248
Wait a minute.

310
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:06,246
You don't think it was intentional?

311
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:08,847
I mean, that's just stupid.

312
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,089
We're geniuses.

313
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:16,923
-Look at them! They're really bonding.
-They're falling in love all over again.

314
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,121
Oh, they see us. Oh, they look mad.

315
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,128
They figured it out.
They're coming. Run!

316
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:27,329
-Where?
-Mexico!

317
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,446
Can you believe they're still not here?

318
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:38,844
I know. A double blind date
and we both get stood up.

319
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:41,129
What are the chances?

320
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:44,248
I know, I'm so bummed.

321
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:46,688
Could we have
our free crab cakes now?

322
00:21:48,293 --> 00:21:51,046
-What?
-We've been stood up.

323
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:54,091
And we want our free crab cakes.

324
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:56,761
Guys, give it a rest.
Nobody's betting on you tonight.

325
00:21:56,933 --> 00:22:01,131
Although we do have a pool going
to see how long it takes that guy to cry.

326
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:05,292
I have such fat hands!

327
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:11,722
