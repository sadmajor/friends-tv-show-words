1
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:06,012
Good morning, tiger.

2
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:10,365
I'm making you a big breakfast, so you
can keep up your strength for tonight.

3
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,888
You're gonna get me
good and pregnant.

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,966
I've got nowhere to go this morning.
I'm unemployed.

5
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:18,964
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my life.

6
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,131
Well, I just lost my erection.

7
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:24,887
No, I mean, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

8
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,283
You're supposed to find
your passion in life.

9
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:30,126
You can be whatever you want
to be now. It's exciting.

10
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:33,285
Yeah, but it's all so overwhelming.
I don't know where to start.

11
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:36,291
Wait a second.
I can help you with this.

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,571
You just need to be organized. We can
make a list of your qualifications...

13
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:46,285
...and categorize jobs by industry.
There could be folders and files--

14
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:50,765
Hey, this is where your hyper-organized
pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.

15
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:52,964
I know!

16
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:55,409
My erection is back!

17
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,929
The One Where Rachel Goes Back to Work

18
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:34,202
Thank you.

19
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:37,524
Joey, could I have a sip of your coffee
and a bite of your muffin?

20
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:40,082
-Okay.
-Thank you.

21
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,125
Thank you.

22
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:53,131
Pheebs, have you ever been bitten
by a hungry ltalian?

23
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:56,892
I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm a little short on cash.

24
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:59,163
If you want,
I could loan you some money.

25
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:02,285
Oh, no. I learned never to
borrow money from friends.

26
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:06,526
That's why Richard Dreyfuss
and I don't speak anymore.

27
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:10,369
Hey, how about this?
Wanna be an extra on my show?

28
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:11,892
You could do that?

29
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:15,284
The pay's pretty good, and you
could do it for as long as you need.

30
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:18,763
-Oh, my God. I'm gonna be on TV!
-Okay, now....

31
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:22,562
I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't
as glamorous and exciting as you think.

32
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:26,328
-Really?
-No, it is awesome.

33
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:28,172
Hey, guys.

34
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:32,126
Why are you all dressed up?

35
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:36,491
We're bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren
today to introduce her to everyone.

36
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,769
-Doesn't she look cute?
-She sure does.

37
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,367
Why does she have a pink bow
taped to her head?

38
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,366
Because if one more person says,
"What a cute little boy" ...

39
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,047
...l'm gonna whip them
with a car antenna.

40
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:49,721
I think she's gonna be
the hit of the office.

41
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:54,011
Yeah, she's gonna be hotter
than peasant blouses and A-line skirts.

42
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,445
Can I get a blue bow?

43
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,172
Okay. I have looked through
a bunch of career guides...

44
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,688
...photocopied and highlighted
key passages...

45
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:10,802
...and put them into alphabetical folders,
so you can make an informed decision.

46
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,043
How long was I in there?

47
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:16,686
Okay, let's start with the A's.
Advertising.

48
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:20,609
Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.

49
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,124
Don't you wanna look through the rest?

50
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:28,808
I don't think I have to hear the rest.
Advertising makes perfect sense.

51
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:30,884
Sorry you had to waste all this time.

52
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:35,092
You call eight hours alone
with my label maker wasted time?

53
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:37,209
Now I'll get to use my shredder!

54
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:41,687
I mean, I could write slogans.
How hard could it be, right?

55
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:46,649
"Cheese. It's milk that you chew."

56
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:54,288
"Crackers. Because your cheese
needs a buddy."

57
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:59,049
"A grape. Because who can get
a watermelon in your mouth?"

58
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,122
I got one.

59
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:05,172
"Socks. Because your family's feet
deserve the best."

60
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,812
Honey, leave it to the pros.

61
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:10,124
I actually know someone in advertising.

62
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:13,126
I grew up with a guy who is
a vice president at a big agency.

63
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,922
Maybe I can get him to meet you.
Give me the phone.

64
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:21,008
"The phone. Bringing you closer
to people who have phones."

65
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:24,648
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."

66
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:32,209
That went well. Almost everybody
knew that she was a girl.

67
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:35,769
Yeah, after you punched that one guy
who got it wrong, word spread.

68
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,611
I'm just gonna go in my office
and pick up some stuff.

69
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:45,487
-Who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

70
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,884
I'm the hell person
whose office this is.

71
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:51,169
Good one, Rach.

72
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:54,724
I'm Gavin Mitchell,
the person who's taking over your job.

73
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:56,042
Excuse me?

74
00:04:57,053 --> 00:04:59,886
Your baby's so cute.

75
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,966
But why would you put
a pink bow on a boy?

76
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:09,963
Hey, Joey. Look at me.

77
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,566
I'm a nurse.

78
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,802
Yes, you are.

79
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,891
I think it might be time
for my sponge bath.

80
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:19,090
Sorry, I'm just so used
to hitting on the extras.

81
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:22,609
-So are you excited about your scene?
-Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.

82
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:26,322
Relax. Don't be. They'll probably
just make you stand in the background.

83
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:29,605
-Good.
-You. Here, come here. Here.

84
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:33,083
Take this tray, stand on this yellow mark.
You're gonna move on "action."

85
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:36,882
Walk over to the operating table, stop on
the blue mark and put the tray down.

86
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,611
Don't walk too fast.

87
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,641
But don't dawdle.

88
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,889
Okay. Now, what?

89
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:48,004
And, action!

90
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,322
Cut! Cut.

91
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,849
-I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
-Well, don't be.

92
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:00,723
Okay, that helps.

93
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:04,001
And, action!

94
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:08,968
Cut!

95
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:12,802
Don't worry about it, Pheebs.
It usually takes me three takes too.

96
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,167
All right, eight.

97
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:20,732
And, action!

98
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:40,849
So do you have any other
questions about advertising?

99
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:43,652
No. But let me show you what I can do.

100
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,562
"Bagels and doughnuts.

101
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:50,567
Round food for every mood."

102
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:54,122
Monica warned me you might do that.

103
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:58,692
I think we might have something
for you at the agency.

104
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:02,732
-Really? That's great.
-It's an unpaid internship.

105
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:08,126
That's funny. When you said "unpaid, "
it sounded like you said "unpaid."

106
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:12,572
Come on, now. Monica has a good job.
It's not like you have a family to support.

107
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:16,362
Actually, we're trying. I don't think
Monica is gonna want to postpone it.

108
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:19,411
We're supposed to have sex tonight.

109
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:23,125
Actually, she's probably at home,
naked right now.

110
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:27,770
I tend to keep talking
till somebody stops me.

111
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:33,203
-I can just picture her on the bed.
-Stop!

112
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:37,082
Wait. What do you mean
you're taking over my job?

113
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:40,484
While you were on your baby vacation,
I was doing your job.

114
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:43,690
A vacation? My idea
of a vacation does not involve...

115
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:47,971
...something sucking on my nipples
until they are raw.

116
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:52,332
Clearly, you've never been
to Sandals Paradise Island.

117
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:58,682
All right. Don't get too comfortable
there, because I'm back in two weeks.

118
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,445
I want everything back
the way it was.

119
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,889
I can't say I care too much for the way
you've rearranged my office.

120
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:06,806
I can't say I care too much
for that smell you've brought in.

121
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:12,127
-Excuse me?
-Rach, we have a code brown situation.

122
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,647
Honey, could you please
take care of it for me?

123
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:20,531
All right, but you're gonna
have to do one sometime.

124
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:23,325
Let me just get this straight.

125
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:26,724
So I go have a baby, and they send
some guy in to do my job?

126
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:30,806
Well, there was talk of shutting down
Ralph Lauren altogether.

127
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:33,089
Okay. Right.
You're very cheeky for a temp.

128
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:36,643
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here
from another department.

129
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:39,566
And what department was that?
The jerk department?

130
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,564
They didn't tell me
about your quick wit.

131
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:45,123
Well, did they mention that
I'm rubber and you're glue?

132
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:49,601
-Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
-Hi, Mr. Zelner.

133
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:51,570
Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.

134
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,645
When you left us, we weren't sure
what we were gonna do.

135
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:58,522
But then, Gavin to the rescue.
Super Gavin.

136
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,166
Well, that's great.

137
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,291
So now, Super Gavin,
when I come back...

138
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:07,490
...where do you plan on flying off to?

139
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:11,322
That's up to Mr. Zelner.
I'm sure he'll make the right decision.

140
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,452
Super ass-kissing power.

141
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,283
Incidentally, when are you coming back?

142
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:19,768
Today.

143
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:23,886
-You said two weeks.
-No, I said today.

144
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:27,841
See, for a superhero,
not so much with the listening.

145
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:34,009
So, what'd he say?

146
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,808
He can be a little rough
around the edges...

147
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:41,524
...so I'm gonna replace a word
he used a lot with the word "puppy."

148
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:47,881
So he said, "If your puppy friend
doesn't get her puppy act together...

149
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:50,965
...I am gonna fire
her mother-puppy ass."

150
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:54,686
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm just not an actor.

151
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,168
That's right. You're not.
You're a nurse.

152
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,722
-You're Nurse With Tray.
-No, Joey--

153
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:02,885
Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
She has no time for friends.

154
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:06,568
She gets in that operating room
and she carries that tray to the doctor...

155
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,610
...because if she doesn't, people die.

156
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,491
Who dies?

157
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,371
Man With Eye Patch!

158
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,842
Now, you get in there,
and you do your job.

159
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,004
Yes, doctor.

160
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,691
Okay, let's try this one more time.

161
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:25,051
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.
Your tray is coming.

162
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,530
And, action.

163
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,483
Yes, I did it! I nailed it!

164
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:38,848
What's next?

165
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,363
The rest of the scene.

166
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,851
Okay, from the top, people.

167
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:54,650
Listen, sudden change of plans.
My maternity leave just ended.

168
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,407
They said if I didn't
come back today, they'd fire me.

169
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,365
What? No, that's illegal.

170
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,127
I'll have the Labor Department
here so fast, they won't--

171
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:07,771
All right, calm down, Norma Rae.
They didn't actually say that.

172
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:12,165
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
this guy will try and squeeze me out.

173
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,245
But what about Emma?
I mean, we don't have a nanny.

174
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:18,365
I know. We're just gonna have
to figure out a plan tonight.

175
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,842
Can you please just take care
of her for today?

176
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:24,689
Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
and we'll be on our way.

177
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:29,364
Come on.
I don't know what else to do.

178
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,087
Fine. Fine.

179
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:35,802
We'll have fun, won't we?
Yes, we will. Yes, we--

180
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:42,212
Ross.

181
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,812
You're pretty.

182
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:55,402
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be
starting a new career from scratch.

183
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:58,406
It's gonna be a while
before I make a living at it.

184
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:02,892
Maybe now's not the right time
to be starting a family.

185
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:07,490
So you have to tell Monica you don't
want to have a baby right now?

186
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:08,642
Yeah.

187
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,171
Goodbye.

188
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,003
Okay, it's baby time.
Pants off, Bing.

189
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:22,691
Didn't see you there, Geller.

190
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,490
Ross is here, so....

191
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:32,525
And I was really hoping
that maybe I could hang out.

192
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:36,612
You know, what do you feel like doing?

193
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:39,962
Well, we're gonna have sex.

194
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:43,167
I don't feel like having sex.

195
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:49,603
Maybe.... I don't know. Maybe we
can watch a movie or something.

196
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,206
Let me put it this way:

197
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:53,807
We're having sex
whether you're here or not.

198
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,245
Pants off, Bing.

199
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:04,770
Now that I'm back, why don't you just
fill me in on what you've been up to.

200
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:08,767
Well, I've changed your screen saver
from that picture of *NSYNC.

201
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:10,645
Hey, they were popular when I left.

202
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:14,287
I'm working on this
big presentation for tomorrow.

203
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,922
I should be involved in that,
so get me up to speed.

204
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:19,846
That'll take weeks.
Let me take care of the presentation.

205
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:22,163
No. I see what you're
doing here, all right?

206
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,565
This is my job, buddy. I've had it for
five years, and I know how it works.

207
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:30,692
-So why don't you just catch me up.
-Fine.

208
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:34,129
Oh, God. You've totally messed
with the back support on my chair.

209
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,523
-How do you fix this?
-You've been here five years.

210
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:40,322
-You figure it out.
-Fine, I will.

211
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,966
All right, fill me in.

212
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:58,368
Do you have a blue tie that would go
with this? Emma spit up on mine.

213
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,172
Yeah, but you have to give it back
if I get a job.

214
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,927
Of course, by that time,
ties will be obsolete...

215
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,130
...and we'll all be wearing
silver jumpsuits.

216
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,085
Hey, good morning, lover.

217
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:13,723
I gotta say, after last night,
I'm a little weak in the knees.

218
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:21,249
Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
take a quick scan.

219
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:24,762
Sorry.

220
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:29,524
But I kind of have this feeling that
we may have made a baby last night.

221
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:33,572
Oh, God, I have to tell you something.

222
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:35,452
You're not pregnant.

223
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,087
What are you talking about?

224
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:40,684
Well, that thing that I have to do
to make a baby?

225
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:41,968
I faked it.

226
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,963
What? You faked it?

227
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:48,083
You know what?

228
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:51,723
I don't need a tie.

229
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:57,484
I mean, it's better open collar,
you know?

230
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:01,327
It's more casual.

231
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:09,290
Joey. Listen, I can't do this.
It doesn't make any sense.

232
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:13,082
Yesterday I was a nurse,
and today I'm a waitress at a café?

233
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:16,603
Sometimes we use the same extras
for different parts. It's okay.

234
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:21,284
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very
memorable performance as the nurse.

235
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,731
And now, suddenly, I'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans.

236
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:31,489
Well, maybe you are a nurse...

237
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:34,929
...but you moonlight as a waitress.

238
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:42,529
Because I'm a single mother
supporting my two children.

239
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:44,452
Nice.

240
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,281
Wait a minute.

241
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:51,805
Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the
same hospital. Wouldn't I come say hi?

242
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:55,926
No. No, see, you and Drake
are having a fight.

243
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:57,652
About what?

244
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:00,691
He slept with you
and then never called you.

245
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:05,846
And I just wanted a new daddy
for Davey and Becky.

246
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,324
Okay. Okay, from the top.

247
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,566
And, action.

248
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,845
So I'm surprised you agreed
to have lunch with me.

249
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:18,408
I'm surprised too. But yet, here I am.

250
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:22,167
Cut! Cut!

251
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,732
What are you doing?

252
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:27,926
I'm very angry at him because he slept
with me and never called me back.

253
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,044
-Me too.
-Me too!

254
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:33,448
Calm down. She means on the show.

255
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:36,127
We need some new extras
around here.

256
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:41,171
Wow. You're here already.

257
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,565
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early
to do research on the presentation.

258
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:49,169
Actually, I made a few changes.
I think I'm caught up on everything.

259
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,085
So ask me anything.

260
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,211
-How do you fix the chair?
-Except that!

261
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:59,525
Hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all ready
for our presentation this afternoon.

262
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:04,363
-Good, because it's in 10 minutes.
-What? I can't do that. I have the baby.

263
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,603
Ross is not gonna pick her up
for an hour.

264
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:09,492
Then Gavin can give the presentation.
We have to do it now.

265
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,123
Ralph needs to leave early today.
He's going helicopter shopping.

266
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:18,368
Well, there you go, you win.
You win.

267
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,366
You get to do the presentation.
You'll knock them dead.

268
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:25,162
No one will remember that I worked here,
and then Ralph will buy his helicopter...

269
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,723
...and Super Gavin will just fly
right alongside of him.

270
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,484
-You can do the presentation.
-No, I can't. I have a baby.

271
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,651
I'll watch her.

272
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:41,882
Why would you do that?

273
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:46,724
Because you worked really hard, and
it's your job. And you're a little crazy.

274
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:49,491
That's really nice.

275
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:53,443
I should tell you that crying women
make me very uncomfortable.

276
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:57,043
Well, you're not gonna like
what's coming.

277
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,922
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

278
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:03,892
God.

279
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:06,125
Thank you. Thank you.

280
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:15,124
I'm really fine. Don't worry.
I'm great with children.

281
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:28,525
Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.

282
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,052
Please don't fire my friend.
Just let me talk to her.

283
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,932
-Okay, but this is her last chance.
-Thank you.

284
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:38,243
How about I do something for you?

285
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:41,371
Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat,
cover up the bald.

286
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:48,091
Listen, Pheebs. I was just talking
to the director...

287
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,171
...and he was thinking maybe
this time you don't hit Drake.

288
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,686
You just wait on the tables.

289
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:55,772
I can't do that. I'm an actor.
I have a process.

290
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:59,249
You're a masseuse.
You have a table with a hole in it.

291
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:03,167
Wait, I see what's happening here.
You're threatened.

292
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,402
What?

293
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:07,883
I'm so good in the scene
that I'm stealing focus from you.

294
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:11,170
Rise to the challenge, Tribbiani,
because I just raised the bar.

295
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,527
Come join me up here.

296
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:20,608
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would
call security. She won't go easy.

297
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:26,211
You faked it?
You couldn't have faked it.

298
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:30,247
Yes, you can. You just make
the faces and the noises.

299
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,771
Guys can fake it?

300
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,731
Unbelievable.
The one thing that's ours.

301
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,052
Why would you fake it
when we're trying to have a baby?

302
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,773
Well, that's actually why.

303
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,763
Look, I'm starting
a whole new career now.

304
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,889
I'm not saying I don't want a baby.

305
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:53,363
I'm just saying maybe
we could wait a little while.

306
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,886
Like a month?

307
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:58,890
-Or a year?
-Really? You wanna wait a year?

308
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:02,045
It could be less than a year.
I mean, you've heard my stuff.

309
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:07,128
"Pants. Like shorts but longer."

310
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:12,083
It'll probably be more than a year.

311
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:19,292
-I really wanna have a baby.
-Well, yeah, me too.

312
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:25,090
Look, I'll just get my old job back.

313
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:27,608
No, I want you to have
a job that you love...

314
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:31,209
...not statistical analysis
and data reconfiguration.

315
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:34,007
I quit, and you learn what I do?

316
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:40,567
I think there's never gonna be
a right time to have a baby.

317
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,769
Now you're unemployed,
and in a little while...

318
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:45,891
...you'll find a new job
that'll keep you really busy.

319
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:48,567
There's always gonna be
a reason not to do this...

320
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:52,806
...but I think once the baby comes,
we'll forget about all those reasons.

321
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,891
I guess.

322
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:58,886
I mean, it's always gonna be scary
when we have a baby.

323
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:01,362
It's gonna be really scary.

324
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:04,366
I mean, God, when we have a baby...

325
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:07,923
...there's gonna be so much
that we're not able to control.

326
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,287
I mean, the apartment's
gonna be a mess.

327
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:15,132
I won't have time to clean it.

328
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,327
What if the baby gets
into the ribbon drawer...

329
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:21,053
...and messes up all the ribbons?

330
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,283
What if there's no room
for a ribbon drawer...

331
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:25,762
...because the baby's stuff
takes up all the space?

332
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:28,003
Where will all the ribbons go?

333
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,562
Should we go make a baby
before you change your mind?

334
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,485
-Yes, please!
-Okay.

335
00:21:33,653 --> 00:21:36,406
And I promise I will not
fake it this time.

336
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:39,724
Well, I wish I could say the same.
I'm a little shook up.

337
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:46,683
I know you botched
that operation on purpose.

338
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:50,892
I can't prove it yet, but when I do,
you'll be going to jail for murder.

339
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,691
I don't care if you are my brother.

340
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,564
I'm not your brother.

341
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,764
What about my children, Drake?

342
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,810
No! No! No!

343
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:06,482
