1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,132
And that's why,
no matter what Mommy says...

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,209
...we really were on a break.
Yes, we were.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,055
Yes, we were.
Come here, gorgeous.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,696
Look at you.
You are the cutest little baby ever.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,535
You're just a little-bitty baby,
you know that? But you've got....

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,611
You've got big, beautiful eyes.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,729
Yes, you do. And a....
And a big, round belly.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,649
Big baby butt.

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,090
I like big butts.

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,889
Oh, my God, Emma.
You're laughing.

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,179
Oh, my God. You've never
done that before, have you?

12
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,855
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you laugh, huh?

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,456
Well, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,534
What? What?
You wanna hear some more?

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,772
I'm a terrible father.

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,090
The One With Ross' Inappropriate Song

17
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,216
-What do you know about investments?
-How come?

18
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,134
I'm starting to make good money on the
show, and I should do something with it.

19
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,293
-What do you do with your money now?
-lt's taped to the back of my toilet tank.

20
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,419
I didn't say that.
It's in a bank guarded by robots.

21
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,659
-Do you have any ideas?
-A guy at work got me excited...

22
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,857
...about going in on an emu farm.
That'd be kind of cool, huh?

23
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,496
Pitching in on the weekends,
helping to plant the emus.

24
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,576
Joe, emus are birds.
You raise them for meat.

25
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,008
Yeah. Right!

26
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,530
People eat birds. Bird meat.

27
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,056
Do they just fly into your mouth?
Or you go in a restaurant and say:

28
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,257
"Excuse me, I'll have
a bucket of fried bird."

29
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,412
Or maybe just a wing. Or a....

30
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,769
You should consider something
a little less risky.

31
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,290
I think real estate is
your best investment.

32
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,574
The Fed just lowered the rates, and the
interest on your mortgage is deductible.

33
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,015
That's right. I know some stuff.

34
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,733
Real estate, huh?

35
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,500
And you know who's selling
a great apartment? Richard!

36
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,369
And you know whose knowledge of
her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!

37
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,058
-My dad told me. They play golf together.
-Well, maybe I'll join them sometime.

38
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,780
I just hope the club doesn't
slip out of my hand...

39
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,057
...and beat the mustache
off his face.

40
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,058
Hi! You have to help me pick a dress.
I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.

41
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,974
Wow, the boyfriend's parents.
That's a big step.

42
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,777
-Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
-They'll love you. Just be yourself.

43
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,574
They live on the Upper East Side
on Park Avenue.

44
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,174
Yeah, she can't be herself.

45
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,252
Okay, so, all right, which dress?

46
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,572
-You can say neither.
-Oh, God. Neither.

47
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,929
I'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.
It'll be fine.

48
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,536
You are in such good hands,
and I am so good with meeting parents.

49
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,096
With the father, you wanna flirt a little,
but not in a gross way.

50
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,253
Just kind of like, "Mr. Pinzer, I can
see where Wallace gets his good looks."

51
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,618
-You went out with Wallace Pinzer?
-He took the SATs for me.

52
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,335
-I knew you didn't get a 1400!
-Yeah, well, duh! I mean....

53
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,935
So now, what about with Mike's mom?

54
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,292
Well, with the mother, just constantly
tell her how amazing her son is.

55
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,975
Take it from me. Moms love me.
Ross' mom one time actually said...

56
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,938
...I am like the daughter
that she never had.

57
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,298
-She said what?
-She's like the daughter she never had.

58
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,416
Listen.

59
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,619
I just got Phoebe all dressed
to meet Mike's parents.

60
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,975
She's so nervous. It's so sweet.

61
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,176
Guess what. I made Emma laugh today.

62
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,975
You what? And I missed it...

63
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,655
...because I was giving a makeover
to that stupid hippie?!

64
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,419
Yeah, and it was like
a real little person laugh too.

65
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,298
It was like:

66
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,897
Only not creepy.

67
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,211
-What did you do to make her laugh?
-I....

68
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,940
Well, I sang. Actually...

69
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,568
...I rapped...

70
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,054
..."Baby Got Back."

71
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,818
You what?

72
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,217
You sang to our baby daughter...

73
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,213
...a song about a guy
who likes to have sex...

74
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,814
...with women with giant asses?

75
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,936
You know what,
if you think about it...

76
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,332
...it actually promotes
a healthy body image...

77
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,775
...because even big butts...

78
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,091
...or " juicy doubles" are....

79
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,854
Please don't take her away from me.

80
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,531
Hi, come on in.
I'm Catherine, the listing agent.

81
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,179
Hi, I'm Joey. This is Chandler.

82
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,935
So how come Richard's selling
the place? Went bankrupt?

83
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,695
Medical malpractice?
Choked on his own mustache?

84
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,815
He's buying a much bigger place.
It's got a great view of Central Park--

85
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,493
That's enough out of you.

86
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,254
Is there anything we should know
about the place?

87
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,732
All the appliances are included.
There's a lot of light, a new kitchen.

88
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,893
I think you guys would be
very happy here.

89
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,292
No, we're not together.
We're definitely not a couple.

90
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,378
-Okay. Sorry.
-That's all right.

91
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,612
Wow, you seemed
pretty insulted by that.

92
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,210
What, I'm not good enough for you?

93
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,696
We are not gonna have
this conversation again.

94
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,250
Look at this place.
Why am I so intimidated by this guy?

95
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,015
Pretentious art.
This huge, macho couch.

96
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,375
When we know
all he does is sit around...

97
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,055
...crying about losing Monica
to a real man.

98
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,893
-You don't think he's here, do you?
-I don't know.

99
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,929
It's a nice place, but I gotta say,
I don't know if I see myself living here.

100
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,931
Well, let me see.

101
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,855
Yeah, I can see it.

102
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,010
Look at these videos.
I mean, who does he think he is?

103
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,570
Magnum Force, Dirty Harry,
Cool Hand Luke.

104
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,332
-Oh, my God.
-What?

105
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,738
There's a tape here
with Monica's name on it.

106
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,734
A tape with a girl's name on it.
It's probably a sex tape.

107
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,293
Wait a minute.

108
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,655
This says "Monica."

109
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,977
And this is Richard's apartment.

110
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,174
Get there faster!

111
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,771
Wow. You look...

112
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,739
...like my mom.

113
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,734
I'm wearing pantyhose.

114
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,970
-Great! Come on in.
-Okay.

115
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,695
Thank you.

116
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,977
-Oh, my God. You're rich.
-No, my parents are rich.

117
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,450
Well, so? They gotta die someday.
Hello!

118
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,218
Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.

119
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,053
Phoebe, these are my parents,
Theodore and Bitsy.

120
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,653
Theodore, Bitsy...

121
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,735
...what a delight.

122
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,970
-It's so nice to finally meet you.
-And you.

123
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,370
Your home is lovely.

124
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,250
Thank you. I'll give you a tour later.
It's actually three floors.

125
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,212
Holy crap!

126
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,699
Why don't you come meet our friends.

127
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,897
Try and stop me.

128
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,575
-What are you doing?
-Trying to get your parents to like me.

129
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,334
I'm sure they will,
but you don't have to do this.

130
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,139
I want them to get to know Phoebe,
not "Phoebe."

131
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,809
-You've got it.
-All right.

132
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,852
It's hard to stop.

133
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,413
Well, come on.

134
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,936
Phoebe, these are our friends
Tom and Sue Engel.

135
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,570
Phoebe, come sit.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

136
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,334
-So where are you from?
-Okay.

137
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,930
Well, all right.
Originally, I'm from upstate...

138
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,298
...but then my mom killed herself,
and my stepdad went to prison.

139
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,851
So I moved to the city, where I lived in
a burned-out Buick LeSabre for a while.

140
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,090
Which was okay. That was okay.

141
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,860
Until I got hepatitis, you know...

142
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,454
...because this pimp spit
in my mouth and....

143
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,213
But I got over it.

144
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,170
And, anyway, now I'm
a freelance massage therapist...

145
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,538
...which isn't always steady money,
but at least I don't pay taxes.

146
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,816
So where does everyone summer?

147
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,573
-Oh, God, this is not going well.
-No, you're doing fine. Really.

148
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,176
-Why don't you go talk to my dad.
-Okay, okay, okay.

149
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,808
-Still sure about me being myself?
-Absolutely.

150
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,295
Though maybe just
a little less "pimp spit."

151
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,733
So, Theodore, I can see
where Mike gets his good looks from.

152
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,094
Well....

153
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,851
-You must work out all the time.
-Not all the time. I do the best I can.

154
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,329
Yeah, I bet. Look out!

155
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,051
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?
-I recently had surgery.

156
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,889
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'll be fine.

157
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,018
-I just should check the stitches.
-I really am sorry.

158
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,059
How could you know? Why wouldn't
you punch me in the stomach?

159
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,900
Did you just hit my dad?

160
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,973
Yes. I'm sorry. I've never met
a boyfriend's parents before.

161
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,700
But, I mean, you have met
humans before, right?

162
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,051
Why don't you go talk to my mom.

163
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,451
Okay, yeah, your mom.
She looks nice. I can talk to her.

164
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,296
You do that, and I'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internal bleeding.

165
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,218
Bitsy? Listen, I wanted to thank you
again for having me here tonight.

166
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,529
Well, not at all.

167
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,170
Also, I just want you to know
what a wonderful man your son is.

168
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,697
-Thank you. I think so too.
-It's a testament to how he was raised.

169
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,772
Especially to you,
because he's very respectful of women.

170
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,569
-Is he really?
-He is so considerate of my feelings.

171
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,530
You know, I think you'd also like
to know that he is a very gentle lover.

172
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,137
Excuse me?

173
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,690
No, don't get me wrong.
No, not in like a sissy way.

174
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,612
When he gets going...

175
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,739
...he can rattle a headboard
like a sailor on leave.

176
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,659
That's...my boy.

177
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,369
Awesome.

178
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,609
I'm not gonna watch it.
I don't need to watch it.

179
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,409
I mean, what good could
possibly come from watching it?

180
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,700
Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.

181
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,730
-Hey, dude, what's up?
-Don't judge me! I'm only human!

182
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,974
Did you take that tape?

183
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,496
I had to! lmagine you were married
and you found a tape of your wife...

184
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,209
...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't
you need to know what was on it?

185
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,133
I don't know. Who am I married to?

186
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,939
Some girl.

187
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,091
She hot?

188
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,492
How did she get me to settle down?

189
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,612
All right, I'm gonna watch it.

190
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,453
I mean, it's probably
not even what I think it is.

191
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,250
Even if it is, it can't possibly be as
bad as what I'm picturing in my head.

192
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,138
Can it?

193
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,935
See, in my experience,
if a girl says yes to being taped...

194
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,570
...she doesn't say no to much else,
I'll tell you.

195
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,930
-Then you have to watch it for me.
-What?

196
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,854
Just for a few seconds
so I can know what it is. Please?

197
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,616
All right, fine. But if I enjoy this,
you have only yourself to blame!

198
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,536
-Why am I hearing cheering?
-It's okay. It's just a football game.

199
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,332
-It's just football?
-You were all worried for nothing.

200
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,811
It's football! It's just football!

201
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,211
This is great! This is the first time
I've ever enjoyed football!

202
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,338
I think it may be customary
to get a beer!

203
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,933
What the...?

204
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,209
-What are you doing?
-You don't wanna see what I just saw!

205
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,257
What are you guys doing?

206
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,173
Oh, my God! Is that Richard?

207
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,454
Okay, please laugh for Mommy.
Please?

208
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,854
Please laugh for Mommy.

209
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,417
Not funny, huh?

210
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,457
Well, so is it...

211
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,454
...only offensive novelty rap?

212
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,335
Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.
Because Mommy can rap.

213
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,928
I can't rap.

214
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,575
All right, sweetheart. This is
only because I love you so much.

215
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,217
And I know that you're
not gonna tell anybody.

216
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,380
Emma, you're laughing! You are!

217
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,011
You really do like big butts, don't you?

218
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,968
You beautiful little weirdo.

219
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,733
You missed it! She was laughing!

220
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,128
It was amazing.

221
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,379
It was amazing. It was the most
beautiful, beautiful sound.

222
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,936
I know, isn't it?
What'd you do to get her to laugh?

223
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,051
You know, I just....
A couple of things I tried. Different....

224
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,495
Just sang a little
"The ltsy-Bitsy Spider."

225
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,214
You sang "Baby Got Back, " didn't you?

226
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,692
Nothing else worked!
That girl is all about the ass!

227
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,176
And then it goes back to the chorus.

228
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,212
Resolve.
And that's the end of the song.

229
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,738
I realize you hadn't asked
to hear it...

230
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,334
...but no one had spoken
in 17 minutes.

231
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,216
Phoebe writes lots of songs. What was
that one you sang the other night?

232
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,014
"Pervert Parade"?

233
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,776
-"Ode to a Pubic Hair"?
-Stop.

234
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,616
Oh, God. Is that veal?

235
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,170
Mom, I thought I told you,
Phoebe's a vegetarian.

236
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,134
No, that's okay. That's okay.
I mean, I am a vegetarian...

237
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,770
...except for veal.
Yeah. No. Veal I love.

238
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,371
-Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.
-Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.

239
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,131
But, you know, especially veal.

240
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,169
You know, and this nice vein of fat
running through it.

241
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,770
Yummy.

242
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,533
So...

243
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,579
...what do you think?

244
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,734
So you stole that tape
from Richard's apartment?

245
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,573
Listen to the judgment
from the porn star!

246
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,136
That tape was never meant
to be seen by....

247
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,054
Joey, I would feel more comfortable
if this conversation were in private.

248
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,089
Monica, look, I don't think you and I
have any secrets anymore.

249
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,574
Not ready to joke about it yet?
See you later.

250
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,609
Why in the world would you take
this tape? And why would you watch it?

251
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,055
Because that's who I am. Okay?

252
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,255
I'm sure a man like Richard could see
a tape like that and not be bothered.

253
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,695
It'd just be another saucy anecdote...

254
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,853
...for him to share at his men's club
over brandy and mustaches.

255
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,776
Is all of this about you not being able
to grow a mustache?

256
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,573
This is about you and Richard.
He's clearly not over you.

257
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,459
He keeps a tape so he can
look at it whenever he wants.

258
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,215
Isn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?

259
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,769
Don't be jealous.
You should feel bad for him.

260
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,613
Yeah, well, poor Richard, he....

261
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,896
I can grow a mustache.

262
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,776
This is not our problem. We have
each other. That's all that matters.

263
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,896
But I just keep picturing you rolling
around with him, with your...

264
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,857
...cowboy boots in the air.

265
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,496
Cowboy boots? I've never worn
cowboy boots in my whole life.

266
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,851
Good, good. Play more
because I wanna see how it ends.

267
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,818
-That's not me!
-What?

268
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,178
That's not you! Life is good again!

269
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,494
Ride 'em, cowgirl!

270
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,370
That bastard taped over me!

271
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,296
Is that a problem?

272
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,528
It's just so insulting.
Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!

273
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,970
I can't imagine what he sees in her.

274
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,576
She actually makes me miss
that pill-popping ex-wife of his.

275
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,369
Hello, dear.

276
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,653
-What's going on?
-We were just chitchatting.

277
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,459
-How's your friend?
-A little better.

278
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,052
Do you know who's moving back into
town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.

279
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,617
You remember her, Michael.
She's lovely, well-behaved and single.

280
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,733
-I'm not interested.
-Please, darling, let's be honest.

281
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,734
You can have all the sailor fun
you want with that one.

282
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,891
-But let's be real.
-All right, stop.

283
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,372
All Phoebe has done is try and get you
to like her. Maybe it's not clear...

284
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,013
...but she did her best.

285
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,935
-She's a little different than you are.
-Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.

286
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,891
So what? If I can get past that,
it shouldn't bother you.

287
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,132
You don't have to like her.
Just accept the fact that I do.

288
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,655
If you can't even be civil
to the woman I love--

289
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,529
-The woman you what?
-Yeah, the woman you what?

290
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,378
The woman I love.

291
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,054
I love you.

292
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,291
Something I shouldn't say for
the first time, in front of my parents...

293
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,530
...and Tom and Sue.

294
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,093
Who are, by the way, the most sinfully
boring people I've ever met in my life.

295
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,370
-I love you too.
-You do?

296
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,853
How great is this?

297
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,979
Wanna get out of here?

298
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,533
-Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner.
-I had a great time.

299
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,659
It was really top-drawer.
And here's something rich.

300
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,972
Thirteen bathrooms in this place,
I threw up in the coat closet.

301
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,329
