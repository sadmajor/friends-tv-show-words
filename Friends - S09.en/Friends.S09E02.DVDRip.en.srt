1
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:05,648  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
You said you'd marry Joey?

2
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:09,084  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:523
Okay, you have to realize,
I was exhausted, I was emotional.

3
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:10,891  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
I would have said yes to anybody.

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:15,092  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
Like that time
when you and I got married.

5
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:17,809  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm not helping.

6
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:22,371  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
So you said yes to him,
and you just had our baby?

7
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:26,407  X1:089 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
That is right. And traditionally,
the daddy gives the mommy a present.

8
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:28,609  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
But I am prepared to let that go.

9
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:33,368  X1:076 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
So when I came here to see if you
wanted to maybe start things up again...

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,764  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:523
...you were engaged to my best friend?

11
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,292  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well--

12
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:40,045  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

13
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:42,727  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought Chandler
was your best friend.

14
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:46,249  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.
Joey's my-- No!

15
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:51,167  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hey, I'm gonna take off.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

16
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:53,170  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Rachel said she'd marry you?

17
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:56,892  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.

18
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:00,729  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
The One Where Emma Cries

19
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:52,047  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:054 Y2:134
I don't want to be negative. So I'll say
most of the signs you bought are good.

20
00:01:55,013 --> 00:02:00,451  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, they ran out of " It's a Girl! "
But I can fix this one.

21
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,564  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:523
See? Huh?

22
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,372  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:523
So sexy.

23
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,001  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:054 Y2:128
-Honey?
-Yeah?

24
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,364  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Honey, why don't you lie down?
-It's okay.

25
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:21,361  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:054 Y2:133
Ross and Rachel will be back soon,
and then I gotta go to the office.

26
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,090  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:054 Y2:094
Am I producing them?

27
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:30,921  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:054 Y2:133
-Why are you so tired?
-I couldn't sleep last night.

28
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:33,971  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:054 Y2:133
I started worrying about this big
divisional meeting I have today.

29
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:36,403  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:054 Y2:133
The more I worried,
the more I couldn't sleep.

30
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,327  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:054 Y2:134
You know, and then I was, like, "If I fall
asleep now, I'll get six hours' sleep.

31
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,565  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:054 Y2:133
But if I fall asleep now,
I'll get five hours' sleep."

32
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,928  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:054 Y2:133
No matter what I did,
I couldn't fall asleep.

33
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,603  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:054 Y2:134
You know what you should've done?
Told yourself that little story.

34
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:53,207  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi.
-Hey.

35
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:54,766  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Welcome home.
-Hi.

36
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:56,247  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe did the signs.

37
00:02:57,253 --> 00:03:00,802  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
You guys, thanks for doing this.

38
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:03,447  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:054 Y2:094
Look at all that stuff people sent.

39
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:07,051  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:054 Y2:134
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something
every mother needs.

40
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:11,445  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up
the entire apartment.

41
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:16,687  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
What are people think--?
You guys, I love it.

42
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:19,731  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, so where's Ross?

43
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,128  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:523
He's downstairs getting the stuff
out of the cab.

44
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,847  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Is he still mad at us?
-Well, you more than me.

45
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,891  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:442 Y2:523
But he can't stay too mad at me.
I mean, I just had his baby.

46
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,561  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's not fair. I can't do that.

47
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,328  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm not sure you should be here
when he comes up.

48
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:37,446  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:442 Y2:523
I didn't think I should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.

49
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:40,121  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, what do I know?
I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

50
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:49,688  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:523
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
New York and London are solid.

51
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:54,324  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
But many of our field offices
have reported disappointing yields.

52
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,293  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:523
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.

53
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:05,126  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
I could go on and on.
But instead of boring you...

54
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:09,127  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I'll go straight to my 42-point plan.

55
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:20,209  X1:296 X2:418 Y1:488 Y2:523
Walter.

56
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,888  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
She's just so cute.

57
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:28,445  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just want to bite her ear off
and use it as a sucking candy.

58
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:30,932  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Phoebe.

59
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:35,211  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
But I could take one of those little feet
and put it in a pita pocket.

60
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:39,403  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay. I put most of the stuff away.
-Oh, great. The pacifiers?

61
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:42,326  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:442 Y2:523
-It's in the cupboard.
-The burping cloths?

62
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:45,366  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Linen closet.
-The diapers?

63
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:46,926  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:523
In the hospital.

64
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:53,283  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy.
-No, I left the diapers at the hospital.

65
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:56,092  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
There's some in the bag,
but I'll run out and get some more.

66
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,402  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, thanks.

67
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,763  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
Could you stop at the coffeehouse
and get me a muffin?

68
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:03,204  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Sure. What kind?
-Let me think.

69
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:06,012  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do I want?

70
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,641  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do I want?

71
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:11,651  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
Please, take your time.
It's an important decision, not like...

72
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:16,603  X1:092 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:523
...say, I don't know, deciding to marry
someone. This is about a muffin.

73
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:20,844  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Blueberry.
-Blueberry it is.

74
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,288  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

75
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,930  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?

76
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,328  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
God, how long do you think
that's gonna last?

77
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:32,970  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know. He got over the
"We were on a break" thing quickly.

78
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,842  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what,
I can't worry about it right now.

79
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:39,244  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because I've got the cutie little baby.

80
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:44,246  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't believe how much I love her.
I mean, I can't get enough of her.

81
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:46,802  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
Like, right now? I miss her.
I actually miss her.

82
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:49,888  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:523
You know, that's her?

83
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:56,731  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:523
God, look at her sleeping.
I love her so much.

84
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,844  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:523
-I think I'm gonna wake her up.
-Rach, no.

85
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:01,811  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, you're never
supposed to wake a sleeping baby.

86
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:04,322  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, I can do whatever I want.
I made her.

87
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:11,365  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:523
Come on, little girl.
Yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.

88
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:19,052  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, I would say I told you so,
but she's kind of doing that for me.

89
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,805  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry.
Go back to sleep.

90
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:24,770  X1:228 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:523
Go back to sleep.

91
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:29,332  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:442 Y2:523
-It breaks your heart, doesn't it?
-It really does.

92
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:32,606  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:523
How long do you think
we have to stay?

93
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,688  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, if everyone's on board,
it's settled.

94
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:39,287  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chandler?

95
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:45,968  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Chandler?
-Yeah.

96
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,488  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you on board?

97
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,203  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes.

98
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,763  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, then problem solved.
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.

99
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:57,362  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're gonna love Oklahoma.

100
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:04,522  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right. We already tried feeding her,
changing her, burping her....

101
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:08,646  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:523
Try this one. "Go back in time
and listen to Phoebe."

102
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,405  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:523
-All right, here's something.
-What?

103
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:14,882  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
It says to try holding the baby
close to your body...

104
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:17,851  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and then swing her rapidly
from side to side.

105
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:21,849  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

106
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,521  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:523
It worked!

107
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:34,491  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:523
No. Just stopped to throw up
a little bit.

108
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:37,412  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
Mon, what am I gonna do?

109
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:41,043  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's been hours,
and it won't stop crying.

110
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:46,325  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:523
-She, Rach. Not it. She.
-Yeah. I'm not so sure.

111
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:50,365  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.
-Yeah, no kidding.

112
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:54,162  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, this just proves no good
can come from having sex with Ross!

113
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:02,926  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, Gunther. Can I get a couple
of blueberry muffins to go?

114
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,089  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Diapers, huh?
-Yep.

115
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,084  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
So I guess Rachel had your baby?

116
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:11,322  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yep. Can you believe it?
-Nope.

117
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,610  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't even believe
she slept with you in the first place.

118
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,610  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:486 Y2:523
You mean, like....

119
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,245  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey.

120
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:32,972  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:523
I know you're pissed at me,
but we have to talk about this.

121
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,926  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually, we don't.

122
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:40,007  X1:085 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
Fine. Okay. But I gotta say, technically,
I didn't even do anything wrong.

123
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,525  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

124
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,009  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I said I didn't technically.
-Okay.

125
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:50,608  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
Let's put aside the fact
that you "accidentally" ...

126
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:55,164  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
...picked up my grandmother's ring and
you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.

127
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,164  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
Can I just stop you there
for a second?

128
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:58,726  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:523
When people do this:

129
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,248  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't really know what that means.

130
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:07,887  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
You were saying?

131
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:11,642  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
And I could even understand
that you couldn't tell Rachel.

132
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:15,726  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
But why couldn't you tell me?
You had all day to, and you didn't.

133
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:19,772  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:442 Y2:523
I know. I should've.
"I'm sorry."

134
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:26,811  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
Not using it right, Joe.

135
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:30,124  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:482 Y2:523
"I'm sorry."

136
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:34,372  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:446 Y2:523
-I'm gonna go.
-No, come on.

137
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,603  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Ross, we have to get past this.
-Give me the bag.

138
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:39,845  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, I don't know what else to do.
I said I'm sorry, now....

139
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,891  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:523
Now you should scream at me
or curse me or hit me.

140
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:46,011  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I'm not gonna hit you.
-You'll feel better. I'll feel better.

141
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:48,687  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know you want to,
I can see it in your eyes.

142
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,087  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I don't.
-A little bit.

143
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:53,050  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No.
-Little bit.

144
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,209  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No.
-A little bit more.

145
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:58,921  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Give me the bag. Give me the bag.
-No, hit me. Hit me.

146
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,124  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Give me the bag. I'm not kidding.
-Hit me.

147
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,210  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No.
-Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!

148
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:18,290  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You ducked!
-I'm sorry! It was a reflex!

149
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,724  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, my God! This really hurts!
-I couldn't help it.

150
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:25,642  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
When a fist comes at your face,
you duck. Look.

151
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:30,087  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
What is the matter with you?

152
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:32,249  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
You were supposed to duck!
Why didn't you?

153
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,330  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.

154
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,811  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:442 Y2:523
Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there,
they can check your reflexes.

155
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:57,046  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Try feeding her again.
-I already fed her.

156
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:59,813  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
I know. That's why I said, "Again!"

157
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,083  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
You guys,
we can't turn on each other, okay?

158
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:05,403  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's just what she wants.

159
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,851  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi.
-Hey.

160
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:09,884  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Can I talk to you outside?
-Just stay here.

161
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:12,408  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm gonna check her diaper.
Pheebs, you want to come?

162
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,332  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm kind of part of this.

163
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,763  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
Actually, it's a husband-and-wife
kind of thing.

164
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,328  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:486 Y2:523
I knew I should've married Chandler.

165
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,481  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Okay, what's up?
-Okay.

166
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:29,446  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know we said it would be fun
to move to Paris for a year?

167
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:32,173  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
And you could study French cooking,
and I could write...

168
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:36,451  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and we could picnic along the Seine,
and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.

169
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,649  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah.
-Okay.

170
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:42,249  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know how people say
that Tulsa...

171
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:45,683  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:488 Y2:523
...is the Paris of Oklahoma?

172
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,612  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? Who says that?

173
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:53,173  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:523
People who have never been
to Paris?

174
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:57,846  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Well, what's going on?
-We're moving to Tulsa.

175
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:02,723  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Excuse me?
-Okay.

176
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:05,566  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ms. McKenna,
she kind of works above my boss.

177
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,606  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
She asked me to move to Tulsa and
be president of our office there.

178
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:12,163  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
And I was sleeping
and apparently said yes.

179
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:15,803  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Tulsa, Oklahoma?
-The Sooner State.

180
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:18,971  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whatever that is.

181
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,370  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:523
Chandler, I don't even want to see
the musical Oklahoma.

182
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:25,292  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning, "
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?

183
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:29,771  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:442 Y2:523
Are you trying to tell me we're moving
to Oklahoma or that you're gay?

184
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:35,008  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, not that this matters, but did
they at least offer you a huge raise?

185
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,286  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:523
No. But they are going to lease us
a Ford Focus.

186
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,886  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'll get out of it.
-Thank you.

187
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:46,090  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What is wrong with Emma?
-She misunderstood.

188
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:48,323  X1:091 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:523
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.

189
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:55,253  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
Ma'am, do you have a minute?

190
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:59,611  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:523
I kind of have some bad news.
I don't think I can move to Tulsa.

191
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:04,644  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-It's a funny story, actually.

192
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,564  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
I kind of fell asleep
in the meeting this morning.

193
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:12,123  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:442 Y2:523
So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
I didn't really know what I was saying.

194
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,448  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:523
You fell asleep?

195
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:16,213  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
But only because I was up all night
worried about this meeting.

196
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:17,692  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
Isn't that funny?

197
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:22,007  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
Irony. Not a fan? All right.

198
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:25,212  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
See, here's the thing.

199
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:28,723  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
I went home and told my wife
about Tulsa, and she won't go.

200
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:32,602  X1:094 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
See me, I love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.
Tulsa is Italy.

201
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:34,729  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
Please don't make me go there.

202
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:39,006  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Chandler, l--
-No, look, Carol. Can I call you Carol?

203
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,164  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why would l
when your name is Elaine?

204
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:50,727  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
What a great picture of your son.
Strapping.

205
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,651  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:523
That's a picture of your daughter,
isn't it?

206
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:59,402  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, she's lovely.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.

207
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,567  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll call you from Tulsa.

208
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,847  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey. So how is it?

209
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:14,767  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I broke my thumb.
-Your thumb?

210
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,812  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's weird.
Are you sure you're punching right?

211
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,487  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Make a fist.

212
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:25,084  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe later.

213
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,925  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:486 Y2:523
Ross, I feel terrible.

214
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:31,530  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what, you can go.
I just have to fill out some forms.

215
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:37,645  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
You want me to help you with that?

216
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:41,482  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:442 Y2:523
Why, does it look like I'm having
trouble with my misshapen claw?

217
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,804  X1:301 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
Name?

218
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,886  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, I know Ross.
But what's it short for?

219
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:53,089  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:486 Y2:523
You know, like Rossell.

220
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:57,322  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:523
Or Rosstrophor.

221
00:14:57,573 --> 00:15:00,007  X1:274 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just Ross.

222
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,604  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's pretty.

223
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:06,410  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay, date of birth?
-You know my birthday.

224
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,643  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sure.

225
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:12,886  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:523
May...tember?

226
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:18,247  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
-October 18.
-Occupation? Dinosaurs.

227
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:25,091  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:523
Actually, I'm a paleon--
Dinosaurs is fine.

228
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:28,405  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:523
The drawing is not.

229
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:34,644  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, who do you want
as your emergency contact?

230
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:38,804  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Rachel, I guess.
-Okay. Relationship?

231
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:41,726  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
Boy, this could take a while.

232
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,849  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Just put roommate.
-Come on.

233
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:50,369  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
You guys are more than that.
You're gonna get together, right?

234
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:52,450  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't think that we are.

235
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,563  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
But you two are supposed
to be together.

236
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:59,845  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, I thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.

237
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:02,408  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come on, Ross,
that didn't mean anything.

238
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:05,326  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
She'd just had the baby. She was
freaked out about doing it alone.

239
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:09,372  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:523
-She would have said yes to anybody.
-Yeah, that's what she said.

240
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,764  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
-So?
-So I don't want to be just anybody.

241
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:17,332  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Wow.
-You know what?

242
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,451  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's better this way anyway.

243
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:24,491  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know what I was thinking,
going down that road again with us.

244
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:30,091  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's just much easier if we're
just friends who have a kid.

245
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,249  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Really?
-Yeah.

246
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:36,008  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
-And you're okay with that?
-Yes. That's what we always planned.

247
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,607  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
And if you have a plan,
you should stick to it.

248
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:42,049  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:523
That's why they call them plans.
Hello?

249
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:46,165  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm fine.

250
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,685  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, for what it's worth...

251
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:53,244  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:442 Y2:523
...with Rachel, I don't think
you'll ever be just ''anybody.''

252
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:56,604  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, there you go.

253
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,689  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:486 Y2:523
"Thanks."

254
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:07,963  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
How long has she been crying?

255
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,442  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
About a week and a half.

256
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:15,084  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, it looks like you guys got it
under control, so I'm just gonna go.

257
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,410  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
No? Really?
Misery really does love company?

258
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,689  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right.

259
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:26,003  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Try holding her a different way.
-Look, I'm doing the best I can.

260
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:29,210  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Anyone else is welcome to try.
-All right, I'll try. Fine.

261
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:31,603  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yes. Okay. Okay.
-Here you go.

262
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:34,367  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey. Oh, gosh.

263
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,570  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
Nothing works with this child!

264
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:41,487  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
God, what am I gonna do, you guys?
I can't even comfort my own baby.

265
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:44,247  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm the worst mother ever.
-No, you're just new at this.

266
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:47,530  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:442 Y2:523
You'll get better. Think about
your first day at work.

267
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,082  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:442 Y2:523
That couldn't have been easy,
but you figured that out.

268
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:54,809  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah, I don't think dressing
provocatively is going to help me here!

269
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:58,483  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
-God, just please take her.
-Okay, I'll take her. Come on.

270
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:01,486  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, boy,
I have to go to the bathroom.

271
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,611  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have to go scream into a pillow.

272
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:12,012  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.

273
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:16,803  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby.

274
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:20,170  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

275
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,373  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:523
Have I gone deaf?

276
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:31,964  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
It worked. Oh, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

277
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:34,687  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:488 Y2:523
You must be a fireball in bed!

278
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:41,885  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't believe it. She's asleep.
I got her to go to sleep.

279
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,362  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have actual magical powers.

280
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:48,642  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can hear traffic and birds.

281
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:51,327  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can hear the voices in my head
again.

282
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,323  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm kidding.

283
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,728  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God!
You got her to stop crying!

284
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,892  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yes, I did. I'm Monica, super aunt.

285
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:10,810  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:446 Y2:523
-You are the official baby-crier stopper.
-Yes, I am.

286
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:14,369  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You're never leaving the apartment.
-Say what?

287
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:18,731  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's your new job, day or night.
She starts crying, I need you here.

288
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:22,482  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No, no, no.
-Thankfully, you don't need me at all.

289
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:26,612  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
So okay. Hey, super aunt?
See you later.

290
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:30,209  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
Rachel?
Let's give it six to eight months.

291
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:41,367  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, so listen,
I'm gonna go lay down.

292
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:43,242  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

293
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:46,251  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
The book says whenever
she's sleeping, I should be sleeping.

294
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:47,766  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
So....

295
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:50,892  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

296
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,930  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey.

297
00:19:56,093 --> 00:20:00,132  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
-We just got her to go to sleep.
-So there can't be any yelling?

298
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,124  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

299
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:09,770  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:523
-We're moving to Tulsa.
-What?

300
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:15,930  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:486 Y2:523
I can't-- I can't hear.

301
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:25,092  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Hey. Where have you been?

302
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:30,369  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What happened to you?
-I had a little thing with Joey.

303
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:32,723  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:523
lf you think this is bad,
you should see him.

304
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:36,403  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, Ross, this is not good.

305
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:40,851  X1:092 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:523
We have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit.

306
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:47,328  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, you have got to get over
this Joey thing.

307
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:52,642  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay? I never really wanted
to marry Joey, okay?

308
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,522  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

309
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:59,813  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know what I really, really want?

310
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,208  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:486 Y2:523

00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:07,327  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
I wanna sleep.

312
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:13,487  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:523
I wanna eat.
I wanna take a shower.

313
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:17,686  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, before she wakes up,
and we gotta do this all over again.

314
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:21,004  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Right.

00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:28,648  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:523
Well, that's what I'm here for.

317
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:34,805  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You want me to get that?
-No, that's really okay.

318
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:39,364  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Monica?

319
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:52,248  X1:097 X2:617 Y1:054 Y2:134
I've been thinking about this.
And I gotta tell you, it's not my fauIt.

320
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:54,927  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:054 Y2:134
-It's a natural instinct.
-What are you talking about?

321
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,886  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:054 Y2:094
Okay, what would you do if I did this?
