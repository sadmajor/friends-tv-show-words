1
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:05,363  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You ready to go?
-Let me just finish this.

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,650  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Ross. Check this out.

3
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:14,845  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:486 Y2:523
Yeah, I can't do that.

4
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:18,090  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What are you doing?
-Have you seen this?

5
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:20,562  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's our new alumni website
for college.

6
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:24,322  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
You can post messages for people,
let everyone know what you're up to.

7
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:28,731  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, great. A faster way to tell people
that I'm unemployed and childless.

8
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:31,766  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's actually interesting to find
out what people are doing.

9
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,332  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:488 Y2:523
Remember Andrea Rich?

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,569  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
That tall girl that wouldn't sleep
with you?

11
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:40,324  X1:071 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, her Internet company went under,
and she lost an ear in a boating accident.

12
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:44,002  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
Bet she'd sleep with you now.

13
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:47,841  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, I already e-mailed her.

14
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:51,686  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
Let me see what you wrote
about yourself.

15
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:54,731  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Doctor of paleontology, two kids."

16
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,369  X1:106 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait a second. You split with Carol
because you had different interests?

17
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:02,811  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think you split with Carol because
you had one very similar interest.

18
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:06,646  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm gonna finish this later, okay?
Let me just grab my coat.

19
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:08,849  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay!

20
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:15,047  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:523
What, did you think you learned how
to do it in the last two minutes?

21
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:22,008  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe we finish this for him.

22
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:29,082  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.

23
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:32,606  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
She is now my girlfriend.

24
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:38,766  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
I don't care what society says,
it's the best sex I've ever had.

25
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:43,206  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:446 Y2:523
-And send.
-No, no-- You can't do that to him.

26
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,324  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:523
-All right, let's go.
-Dude!

27
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:49,805  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:523
I think you made it clear you can't be
trusted with the ball inside the house.

28
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:59,165  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
And send.

29
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,289  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
The One With the Memorial Service

30
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:40,243  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:094
Hey. How was basketball?

31
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,206  X1:117 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
It was fun. Right up until Chandler
got a finger in the eye.

32
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,170  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, no! Who did that?

33
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,603  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:054 Y2:089
Chandler. Yeah.

34
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:49,811  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:054 Y2:094
Hey!

35
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:51,842  X1:301 X2:419 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Rach?
-Yeah?

36
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:54,886  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:054 Y2:128
What's Huggsy doing
in the crib with Emma?

37
00:02:55,533 --> 00:03:00,004  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:054 Y2:133
She was just crawling around and found
him, so I just let her sleep with him.

38
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:03,722  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:054 Y2:128
-That's all right, isn't it?
-Of course. Yeah.

39
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:08,921  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:054 Y2:128
It's a stuffed animal, you know?
It's for kids. Not for adults.

40
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:10,731  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know that.

41
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,686  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:054 Y2:134
Joey, you're sure? I mean,
I know how much you love him.

42
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:18,847  X1:110 X2:610 Y1:054 Y2:133
Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?
I do not love Huggsy.

43
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,732  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:089
I like him a normal amount.

44
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,328  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:523
All right.
Well, Emma loves him.

45
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,809  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:054 Y2:133
Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she?
He's a wonderful person!

46
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,245  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi.
-Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?

47
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:39,564  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:054 Y2:133
-You feeling better?
-Breaking up sucks.

48
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:43,408  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:054 Y2:133
-Oh, I really miss Mike.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

49
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:47,242  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:054 Y2:134
I've tried everything to feel better.
I even tried writing a song about it...

50
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:50,405  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:054 Y2:133
...but I can't think of anything
that rhymes with:

51
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,131  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need
your help getting through this.

52
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,403  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're saying you're
not gonna need my help?

53
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,729  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
No. When I get to the point
where I'm ready...

54
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:04,124  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
...to hear cruel, mocking jokes
about Mike, I'm gonna come to you.

55
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:08,081  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, good, because I've already thought
of three. Four! I just thought of a fourth!

56
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,482  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. I mean, I know
I did the right thing.

57
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,126  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:444 Y2:523
Mike never wants
to get married...

58
00:04:13,293 --> 00:04:16,205  X1:103 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and I shouldn't be in a relationship
that has no future.

59
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,603  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
But pretty soon,
I'm gonna miss him so much...

60
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:21,606  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
...l'm gonna want to see him again,
and you have to stop me.

61
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,963  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, you got it.

62
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:29,169  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Unless....
Am I being too crazy about this?

63
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,963  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:523
All right, so there's no future. But that
doesn't mean we still can't have fun.

64
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,723  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You know what? Forget what I said.
-Really?

65
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:41,442  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
-All right, if that's what you want.
-That was a test, and you just failed.

66
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:45,331  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:488 Y2:523
Damn it! Rookie mistake!

67
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:51,682  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I have sex with dinosaurs?

68
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,773  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:488 Y2:523
I believe I read that somewhere.

69
00:04:57,493 --> 00:05:00,212  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
Not only is it not funny,
it's physically impossible! Okay?

70
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:05,322  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
Depending on the species, I'd have
to have a 6-foot-long-- It's not funny!

71
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,962  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
I respectfully disagree.

72
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,403  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe you put that
on my alumni page.

73
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:14,127  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Who cares? Nobody reads those.
-You better hope not...

74
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,483  X1:169 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
...because I just read what
you put on your page.

75
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:19,890  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I don't have a page.
-Oh, I respectfully disagree!

76
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,167  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look at you. All sweet and innocent,
sleeping like an angel.

77
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:45,169  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
With Emma's chubby little hands
wrapped around you.

78
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,323  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.

79
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,686  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
Step away from the crib!
I have a weapon!

80
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:58,448  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's okay! It's okay, Rach!
It's me! Put down the scrunchie.

81
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:01,932  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What are you doing?
-Well, I heard Emma stirring...

82
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:05,483  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
...so I came in to make sure
she could reach Huggsy.

83
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:10,012  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that
I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

84
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:13,609  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

85
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,969  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
This isn't over!

86
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:23,211  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait a second. Why would
Ross tell everyone in your class...

87
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:27,088  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that you are "as gay
as the day is long"?

88
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,050  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because I told everyone
he slept with dinosaurs.

89
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:36,283  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, that's clearly a joke.
This could easily be true.

90
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:41,811  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:444 Y2:523
Would you get that, please? People have
been calling to congratulate me all day.

91
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:46,208  X1:306 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello?

92
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:50,252  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:523
No, he's not here.
Yeah, this is his wife.

93
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:54,242  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. Well, it came
as quite a shock to me too!

94
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,844  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, I guess I should've known. He just
kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.

95
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,571  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hang up! Hang up!

96
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,644  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
And that was a great movie.

97
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,166  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm so gonna get back at Ross.

98
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,608  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, yeah, this'll show him.
Here we go.

99
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:14,010  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What are you doing?
-Oh, you'll see, my friend!

100
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,767  X1:281 X2:438 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm dead?

101
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,649  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:523
And so young.

102
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:28,922  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Posting that I died?
That really isn't funny.

103
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:31,004  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, how you died was funny.

104
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:33,773  X1:167 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?

105
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:38,492  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
It kills over one Americans
every year.

106
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:42,364  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
Unbelievable. My classmates
are gonna think I'm dead.

107
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,491  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
My professors. My parents
are gonna get phone calls!

108
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:47,564  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're messing with
people's feelings here.

109
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:51,209  X1:078 X2:641 Y1:448 Y2:523
You wanna talk about people's feelings?
You should have heard how hurt...

110
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:55,252  X1:091 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
...Professor Stern was when I told him
I wouldn't be able to go to Key West!

111
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,846  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
You've really crossed a line here.
But that's okay.

112
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:01,686  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
Because I'm on my way
to buy some Photoshop software...

113
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:03,366  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and a stack of gay porn.

114
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:07,492  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's right. Your coming-out
is about to get real graphic!

115
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,727  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:486 Y2:523
God, I wish Mike were here.

116
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:18,210  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, if Mike were here, what
would the two of you be doing?

117
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:23,162  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:523
What are you, animals?
It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

118
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:26,849  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:523
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him.
There's no harm in that.

119
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:32,212  X1:084 X2:632 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's how it starts. "I don't need
to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing.

120
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:36,286  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:442 Y2:523
Why not just a little sliver?"
Or, "Okay, just a slice or two."

121
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:38,569  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
The next thing you know,
you're 210 pounds...

122
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:41,406  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and you get wedged in going
down the tunnel slide!

123
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:45,085  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.

124
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:48,370  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
But look, if you talk to him,
then you're gonna want to see him.

125
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:51,172  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
And if you see him, you're gonna
wanna get back together.

126
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,972  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I know that's not what you want.

127
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,801  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, so give me your phone.

128
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,845  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here.

129
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:04,092  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
-And now your cell.
-Okay.

130
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:10,208  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
There you go.

131
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:19,848  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:523
-This is your cell phone?
-Yes.

132
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:23,250  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
This is your current cell phone?

133
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,010  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yes. It reminds me
of a simpler time.

134
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:31,849  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe? Where's your purse?

135
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:34,811  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey! No!
-No!

136
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:36,691  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Give it to me!
-You can't have it!

137
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:38,844  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Give it to me!
-No!

138
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:42,770  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I'll go in there!
-Oh, yeah.

139
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,082  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Phoebe, come here!
-No!

140
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:48,041  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Give it to me!
-You're crazy!

141
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:53,365  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:523
Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!

142
00:09:55,973 --> 00:10:00,967  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, look who's here. It's Joey.
And he brought home a friend.

143
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:05,132  X1:073 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
Emma's right here. You promised not to
bring girls home in the middle of the day!

144
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,086  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, no, no, it's not a girl. It's...

145
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:10,892  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:523
...a brand-new Huggsy!

146
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:14,210  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh! Oh, that's so great!
Now Emma has two Huggsies!

147
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:18,292  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no. Oh, no.
No, Emma has one Huggsy.

148
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:20,091  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
The new Huggsy.

149
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,689  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
The other Huggsy, I don't know,
I guess I'll just take him back.

150
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:28,529  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what? When I was a little girl,
I had a little pink pony named Cotton.

151
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:33,005  X1:113 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, I loved her so much. I took her
everywhere. I would braid her tail--

152
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,050  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:488 Y2:523
Make the transfer!

153
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:42,807  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
Should I be concerned that a button fell
off the old Huggsy and I can't find it?

154
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:46,767  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, don't worry about it.
I swallowed that years ago. Hey!

155
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:51,403  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, what? I don't think
she likes the new Huggsy.

156
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:54,326  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:523
-But he's the same.
-I think she wants the old one back.

157
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,411  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah, but he's the same.
-Joey, come on.

158
00:10:57,613 --> 00:11:00,127  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
But he's the same!

159
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:05,001  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're not the same.

160
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:11,042  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, it's a lot
less surprising to do that...

161
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,408  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:523
...after I've buzzed you
into the building.

162
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,850  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
So, Phoebe, why are there
men's shoes by the door?

163
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:21,008  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
Those are my shoes.

164
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:24,165  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, when you get over this breakup,
we need to go shopping.

165
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:27,645  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look, Monica, I really appreciate
you checking in on me.

166
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,168  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:523
-But I'm actually feeling a lot better.
-You are?

167
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,688  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, I just kind of want
to be alone right now.

168
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:39,166  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Who's that?
-I ordered Chinese food.

169
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:44,205  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are the chances?!

170
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:48,168  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
One billion Chinese people,
and they send Mike!

171
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:55,128  X1:172 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What are you doing here?
-Phoebe called me.

172
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:57,762  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Phoebe!
-I'm sorry. I broke down.

173
00:11:57,933 --> 00:11:59,161  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wanted to see him.

174
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,369  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Damn it, Phoebe,
how did you even call him?

175
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,723  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:523
There's a speakerphone
on the base unit.

176
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,164  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:486 Y2:523
Base unit. Think, Monica, think!

177
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:10,530  X1:075 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she--
-This doesn't concern you!

178
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:15,164  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
Sorry. I guess I was thrown off
by the mention of my name.

179
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:18,969  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, guys, you can't do this.

180
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,442  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's gonna make getting
over each other harder.

181
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:25,566  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
Not if nothing happens.
Why can't we just hang out as friends?

182
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:30,648  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
Sure. If you're just gonna hang out
as friends, then maybe I'll join you.

183
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:33,492  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know, I'm your friend
and Mike's friend.

184
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:38,609  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sit down.

185
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:44,169  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
Make room for your friend.

186
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:56,532  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:523
-So how have you been?
-I've been pretty good.

187
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,921  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You look really beautiful.
-Thanks. You look good too.

188
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:09,644  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no, no. This is dangerous territory.
Keep it clean.

189
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:12,411  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
So how's the piano playing going?

190
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:15,810  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
Actually, I've been playing a lot
of love songs lately.

191
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:19,682  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I've missed you.
-I've missed you too.

192
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:27,128  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, on the way over here,
I saw this drunk guy throw up.

193
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,006  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
And then a pigeon ate it.

194
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,326  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey. Ross.

195
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:39,565  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, I just wanted to apologize.

196
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:43,521  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
Don't tell me you actually made
those gay pictures of me.

197
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:45,851  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Check this out.

198
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:49,204  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:523
So that's what I'd look like
if I worked out.

199
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:53,289  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
And was being serviced
by a policeman.

200
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:55,523  X1:175 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're not gonna actually
send these out, are you?

201
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:59,521  X1:087 X2:633 Y1:444 Y2:523
Actually, I don't need to, because your
little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work.

202
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,365  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay? There were no responses.

203
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:05,970  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:444 Y2:523
Nobody posted anything, nobody called
my parents, so the joke is on you.

204
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:10,968  X1:087 X2:632 Y1:444 Y2:523
Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,
nobody cares that I'm dead.

205
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:16,331  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

206
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:20,003  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Nobody cares that I'm dead?
-Oh, come on, you know that's not true.

207
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:22,482  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
What are you talking about?
You get 60 responses...

208
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,291  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:523
...just for coming
out of the closet.

209
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:27,604  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:523
I didn't get one response,
and I'm dead!

210
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:32,005  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, the gay community is a lot more
vocal than the dead community.

211
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:37,850  X1:075 X2:646 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe this. Not even my geology
lab partner. And I carried that guy!

212
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,845  X1:120 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, let's think about this, okay?

213
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,085  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
You think people are gonna disturb
your family at this tragic time?

214
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:45,887  X1:079 X2:640 Y1:448 Y2:523
That people are gonna post condolences
on a website?

215
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,771  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
This isn't about people not caring.

216
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:52,723  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is about people not having
a decent outlet for their grief.

217
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,487  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
-Right.

218
00:14:55,693 --> 00:15:00,164  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial
service, tons of people would come.

219
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,008  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:482 Y2:523
Exactly!

220
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:06,082  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
Ross, what are you doing?

221
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,483  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're having a memorial service
for yourself?

222
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:12,846  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, that would be stupid.
You're having it for me.

223
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:17,086  X1:094 X2:626 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Ross, don't press send. Don't press--
-No, too late. Too late. It's sent.

224
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:20,370  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
Sorry, so is that picture
of you and the policeman.

225
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:24,972  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
Have you seen Huggsy?

226
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:27,004  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
Original or crappy?

227
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,727  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Original.
-No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.

228
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:33,970  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then what's that big lump
under your covers?

229
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,964  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:523
-It's Monica, okay?
-That's not Monica!

230
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:41,364  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, fine!
It's original Huggsy!

231
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:45,367  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
I know Emma wants him,
but he's mine and I need him.

232
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:48,127  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
She's being unreasonable.

233
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,609  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, there is a reason that Emma
loves that stupid penguin so much!

234
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:53,804  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, don't cover its ears!

235
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:58,088  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's because it reminds her
of her Uncle Joey.

236
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,571  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:448 Y2:523
-It does?
-Yeah.

237
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:05,409  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
And she's comforted by him because
she loves her Uncle Joey so much.

238
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:09,288  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Really? She loves me?
-Oh, yeah.

239
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:12,326  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
But you know what?
If you need Huggsy, don't worry.

240
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:15,565  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:523
Emma will totally understand.
I won't, but whatever.

241
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:20,130  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:523
Okay, wait a minute, Rach.
I mean, if....

242
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:23,763  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:523
If Huggsy means that much
to Emma, then....

243
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:25,367  X1:192 X2:535 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, she can have him.

244
00:16:25,773 --> 00:16:28,367  X1:146 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey
would step up.

245
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:32,362  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Look, Emma. Look who's back.
-No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!

246
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:35,326  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are you--? You're gonna take
Huggsy away from a little child?

247
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,808  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
How do you think I got him
in the first place?

248
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:42,523  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, you two.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

249
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:44,684  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
I don't want anything going
on while I'm gone.

250
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,810  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here's a few things you can discuss:

251
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:51,046  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
Mucus, fungus, and the idea
of me and Ross doing it.

252
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:55,806  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
I've missed you so much.

253
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:59,688  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
I won't ask you to get back together.
I know we want different things, but....

254
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,321  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Just to be with you one more night.
-I want that too.

255
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:06,486  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
-But is that gonna make it too hard?
-It can't be any harder than this.

256
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,652  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, if I had known the last time
I saw you would be the last time, l--

257
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:13,691  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
I would have stopped to memorize
your face, the way you moved.

258
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:15,969  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
Everything about you.

259
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:20,046  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
If I had known the last time I kissed
you would be the last time...

260
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,568  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I never would have stopped.

261
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:26,247  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:523
Kiss him, you fool!

262
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:29,202  X1:150 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-Didn't you hear that speech?

263
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:31,523  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:523
If you don't kiss him,
then I will.

264
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:34,721  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:523
I missed you so much.

265
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:38,763  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I knew you'd be here!
-Crap.

266
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:42,608  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Who is this?
-My friend Manny.

267
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:45,651  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
I asked him to keep me
away from you.

268
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:50,451  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.
-Well, you're not doing a very good job.

269
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:53,049  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Excuse me?
-What's with the kissing?

270
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:55,687  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, at least I knew
where my guy was.

271
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:58,890  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, thank God you were here
to oversee all the kissing.

272
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:02,413  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You didn't hear the speech.
-I've heard the speech.

273
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:04,729  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:523
If he knew it was gonna
be the last time--

274
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,168  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, it was very moving.
You're just heartless!

275
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:09,648  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You're weak!
-You're weird!

276
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:12,367  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
Your pants are undone.

277
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:17,009  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:523
Where'd they go?

278
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:21,129  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Damn it.
-Well, we blew it.

279
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:23,363  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:482 Y2:523
I blame myself.

280
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:25,684  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I blame you too.

281
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:35,402  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's been an hour, and not one
of my classmates has shown up?

282
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:40,209  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
I tell you, when I actually die, some
people are gonna get seriously haunted.

283
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:43,650  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
There you go. Someone came.

284
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,969  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.

285
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:49,443  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is so exciting.
My first mourner!

286
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:54,643  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi. Glad you could come.

287
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:58,283  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Please come in.
-Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?

288
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:02,685  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.
-Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.

289
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:06,402  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:523
Thanks. I'm so sorry
about Ross, it's....

290
00:19:06,573 --> 00:19:09,133  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, at least he died doing
what he loved.

291
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:11,488  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:523
Watching blimps.

292
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:19,042  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Who is it?
-You know some guy, Tom Gordon?

293
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,612  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't remember him.

294
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:24,322  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
But then again,
I touched so many lives.

295
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,012  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
So did you know Ross well?

296
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:31,210  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:448 Y2:523
Actually, I barely knew him.
I came because I heard Chandler's news.

297
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,887  X1:107 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do you know if he's seeing anyone?

298
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:42,242  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Yes, he is. Me.
-What? You mean--?

299
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:49,049  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
Can I ask you a personal question?
How do you shave your beard so close?

300
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:52,408  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, Tommy!
That's enough mourning for you.

301
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:55,804  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.

302
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:59,602  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey, listen. Call me.
-Okay.

303
00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:06,443  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I'm dead and no one cares?
-I look like a man?

304
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:09,691  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:523
Please, one ridiculous problem
at a time.

305
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:12,526  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:523
This isn't ridiculous.
Look around, no one's here.

306
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:16,282  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
You gave them one day's notice. Not
everyone checks the website every day.

307
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:19,809  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
And Monica, it's probably
the way you stand!

308
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:24,170  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
I guess you're right.
Still, somebody must have seen it.

309
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,212  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
I went to that school for four years
and I didn't have an impact on anyone?

310
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:31,524  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, that's not true.
You had an impact on me.

311
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:34,287  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
I mean, it's 15 years later
and we're still best friends.

312
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:37,047  X1:118 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:523
Doesn't that count for something?

313
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:44,050  X1:167 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, great, more party boys
for Chandler.

314
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:47,842  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sure it's somebody for you.
Now go hide.

315
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:54,883  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's
memorial service.

316
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:59,089  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Kori? Kori Weston?
-Yeah.

317
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:02,212  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You look amazing.
-And you are?

318
00:21:02,413 --> 00:21:05,803  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
Chandler. Chandler Bing.
And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.

319
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,884  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
You are married, though.

320
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:11,125  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
Don't listen to him.
He's in a really bad mood.

321
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:17,929  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe that Ross is gone.
It is just so sad.

322
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,089  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:523
I didn't know Ross and you
were so close.

323
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:23,968  X1:091 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, we weren't. But we had one class
together. He was such a great guy.

324
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:27,569  X1:148 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:523
And he talked so passionately
about science.

325
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:31,203  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I always remembered him.
-I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.

326
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,091  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:488 Y2:523
And if heaven has a door...

327
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:36,882  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:442 Y2:523
...l'm sure he's pressing his ear
up against it and listening intently.

328
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:42,487  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought so many times about
calling him and asking him out.

329
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:44,450  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:523
I guess I really missed my chance.

330
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:47,048  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, you didn't!

331
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,287  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm still alive!

332
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:54,082  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
Kori, I know this
is a big surprise for you.

333
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:58,252  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's a long story. But the things you
just said really made my day.

334
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:00,483  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:523
The fact that you're here
means more to me...

335
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,247  X1:148 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:523
...than if this room were filled
with people.

336
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:06,282  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:488 Y2:523
You sick freak! Who does that?

337
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:09,126  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't believe I had a crush on you.

338
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:14,971  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:523
Did you hear that?

339
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,682  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:488 Y2:523
Kori Weston had a crush on me!

340
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:29,049  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:054 Y2:091
No, Mom, I am not dead.

341
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:32,610  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:054 Y2:128
I know it's not something
to kid about.

342
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:37,491  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:054 Y2:133
It was just a practical joke between
Chandler and me, but it's over, okay?

343
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:42,524  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:054 Y2:133
Actually, no. Even if I had died,
you would not be left childless.

344
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:45,849  X1:292 X2:428 Y1:054 Y2:089
Monica?

345
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:50,722  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:054 Y2:133
