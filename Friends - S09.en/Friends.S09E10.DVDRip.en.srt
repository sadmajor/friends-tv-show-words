1
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,641  X1:171 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle

2
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:09,691  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:523
And away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

3
00:00:09,853 --> 00:00:12,845  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
But I heard him exclaim
Ere he drove out of sight

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:18,246  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
"Merry Christmas to all
And to all a good night. "

5
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:25,127  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wow! That was great!
You really wrote that?

6
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:30,812  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:523
Say goodbye, elves.
I'm off to Tulsa.

7
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:33,203  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:523
I can't believe you won't be here
for Christmas.

8
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:35,125  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're really not coming back?

9
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:38,330  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
We have this paperwork that needs
to be filed by the end of the year.

10
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,093  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:523
-If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
-It's so unfair.

11
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:44,165  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You don't even like your job.
-So. Who does?

12
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:45,772  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I like my job.
-I love my job.

13
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,891  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I can't wait to go back to work.
-I can't get enough dinosaurs.

14
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,124  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry I won't be here.

15
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:57,973  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's hard enough not seeing you
during the week...

16
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,010  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
...but for Christmas....

17
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:02,243  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:523
If this is what you have to do,
I understand.

18
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:04,689  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks.

19
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:06,047  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll see you New Year's Day.

20
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:08,290  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:523
You're not gonna be here
New Year's Eve?

21
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:12,369  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Did I not mention that?
-No.

22
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:14,644  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:523
And to all a good night!

23
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:18,763  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:488 Y2:523
The One With Christmas in Tulsa

24
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,730  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:054 Y2:128
All right, everybody.
I know it is Christmas Eve...

25
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:13,124  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:054 Y2:134
...and you'd rather be with family,
but there is no call for writing...

26
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:17,730  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:054 Y2:134
..."Screw you, Mr. Bing"
on the back of my chair.

27
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,163  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:054 Y2:133
By the way,
you can all call me Chandler.

28
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:23,483  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Hey. Where you been?

29
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:26,850  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:054 Y2:133
I was checking out that insurance
company's Christmas party on three.

30
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,130  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:054 Y2:133
It was really beautiful. They have
decorations and this huge tree.

31
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:33,171  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:054 Y2:130
And I just thought,
to hell with them, we have to work.

32
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,801  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:523
So I stole their ham.

33
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:39,129  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:054 Y2:133
Hear that?
You may not be with your families...

34
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,807  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:054 Y2:129
...but at least it's gonna smell like ham
in here.

35
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:45,009  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
My kid's in a play right now.

36
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:48,088  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:054 Y2:133
You know what?
I know what will cheer you up.

37
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:51,928  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
I had a talk with the boys in New York.
I told them about all your hard work...

38
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:55,403  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:054 Y2:133
...and that a little Christmas bonus
may be in order.

39
00:02:55,613 --> 00:03:00,812  X1:075 X2:644 Y1:054 Y2:134
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

40
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:06,051  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:054 Y2:095
Well, that's like money in your pocket.

41
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,443  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:523
All right, you want me to say it?
This sucks.

42
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:10,928  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
Being here sucks. This work sucks!

43
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,328  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now it feels like Christmas.

44
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,565  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,566  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
At least you get to go home
and be with your families tonight.

46
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,167  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have to go to an empty hotel room
and lay down...

47
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,643  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
...on a very questionable bedspread.

48
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:27,926  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then tomorrow, you get to have
Christmas in your own houses.

49
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,448  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Which, by the way,
none of you have invited me to.

50
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:34,726  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:523
-You can come to my house.
-No, thanks.

51
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,171  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:523
-It was a nice pep talk.
-Thanks.

52
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:41,968  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm actually thinking about becoming
a motivational speaker.

53
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:46,282  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
So if you were home right now,
what would you be doing?

54
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:50,611  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
Typical Christmassy stuff, you know.
Our holidays are pretty traditional.

55
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,571  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:442 Y2:523
So here's a very special
holiday song...

56
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,203  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that I wrote for some
very important people to me.

57
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,967  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:523
Happy holidays, everybody.

58
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,967  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
Pheebs, look in the kitchen.
I'll look in the back closet.

59
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:58,443  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

60
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,049  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. Chandler,
why don't you take a walk.

61
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,090  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:523
This doesn't concern you.

62
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:06,367  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
We are looking for
our Christmas presents from Monica.

63
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:09,764  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:442 Y2:523
-What? That's terrible.
-No, no. We do it every year.

64
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:12,328  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, that makes it not terrible.

65
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:17,725  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
No. Yeah, we never find them.
She's always bested us, that wily...

66
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:19,167  X1:295 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:523
...minx.

67
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:21,765  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:523
We're gonna search here
for an hour...

68
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,128  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and then we'll go to Joey's
and search. Okay?

69
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:26,966  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, not okay.
You can't look for Monica's presents.

70
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,930  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No, we have to.
-No, you don't have to.

71
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:32,881  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:523
And you can't,
because I live here too.

72
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:37,365  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well, then you should look with us.
-Why?

73
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:40,411  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:442 Y2:523
Aren't you worried about what
to get Monica for Christmas?

74
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:42,729  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I have a great idea
for a present for her.

75
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:45,847  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's it? "A great idea"?

76
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:49,326  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's not enough.
What if she gets you a great present...

77
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:51,529  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
...two medium presents
and lots of little presents...

78
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:54,810  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and you got her one great present?
That's gonna make her feel bad.

79
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,646  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

80
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,602  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
-If I helped, we could find them faster!
-Right.

81
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,244  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
-We have a live one!
-It's a Macy's bag!

82
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,842  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:486 Y2:523
Who's it for?

83
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:16,971  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Dear Losers: Do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

84
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:22,241  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

85
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:25,763  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:523
Rach, these are for you.

86
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:30,486  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.

87
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:34,652  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do.

88
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:40,211  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

89
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:44,964  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:488 Y2:523
Toilet seat covers!

90
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:50,487  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?

91
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,048  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:523
You guys.

92
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:57,411  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:486 Y2:523
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet Tooth.

93
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:04,808  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You got me a cola drink?
-And...a lemon-lime!

94
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:08,531  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, this-- This is too much.

95
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:11,446  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:523
I feel like I should get you
another sweater.

96
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:16,206  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
And last but not least....

97
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:21,204  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
They're ribbed, for your pleasure.

98
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:23,730  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, hey, Ben?

99
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:29,843  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
What if the Holiday Armadillo
told you all about the Festival of Lights?

100
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:31,486  X1:310 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cool!

101
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:33,331  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:486 Y2:523
Come on, Ben.

102
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:42,162  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
Years and years ago, there were
these people called the Maccabees!

103
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:46,005  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:523
Merry Christmas!

104
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,006  X1:301 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Santa!

105
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,605  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you doing here, Santa?

106
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:58,166  X1:080 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.

107
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,484  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you doing here...

108
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:04,282  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:488 Y2:523
...weird turtle-man?

109
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:12,247  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm the Holiday Armadillo,
your part-Jewish friend.

110
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:17,128  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
You sent me here to give Ben
some presents.

111
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:19,488  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:523
Remember?

112
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:22,684  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

113
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:24,970  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:442 Y2:523
Ben, why don't you open
some more presents.

114
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,767  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

115
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:31,603  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:442 Y2:523
There's a sentence I never thought
I'd say.

116
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,012  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you doing?

117
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,205  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
You called and said you had trouble
finding a Santa costume...

118
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,887  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:444 Y2:523
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

119
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:42,482  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

120
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:44,092  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Why?
-Because...

121
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:46,887  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:523
...l'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah.

122
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:48,486  X1:189 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
And you're wrecking it.

123
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:52,572  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:442 Y2:523
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowl full of jelly.

124
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:59,248  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

125
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:03,441  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, fine. I'll give the suit back.

126
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:07,765  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

127
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,409  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:523
Santa? Really?

128
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:17,013  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah, is that okay?
-Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

129
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:21,932  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No.
-Then it's okay!

130
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,129  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know what, everybody?

131
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:28,409  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Go home.
You should be with your families.

132
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:30,729  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's bad enough we're working
New Year's Eve.

133
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:36,364  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:523
Did I not tell anyone
about New Year's Eve?

134
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,730  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, look, go. Go home, okay?
Merry Christmas.

135
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:42,889  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Merry Christmas.
-Peace on earth.

136
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:47,569  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Bye.
-Good. Godspeed, good people.

137
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:52,246  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You're not gonna go?
-No. I couldn't leave you alone.

138
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:54,608  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks.

139
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:58,642  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:442 Y2:523
Besides, I can't leave until that
Christmas party downstairs clears out.

140
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:01,964  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
There are some pissed-off
insurance people looking for that ham.

141
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,923  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Chandler Bing.
-Hi, honey. We're all here.

142
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:09,811  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:523
We want to wish you
a merry Christmas.

143
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:12,083  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

144
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,724  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
Merry Christmas. I miss you guys.

145
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,401  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
So is it horrible?
Is everybody working really hard?

146
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,326  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, no, it's just me and Wendy.

147
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:25,133  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wendy? That sounds like a girl's name.

148
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,362  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
It is. Did I not tell you about her?

149
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:32,166  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:523
About the time you told me
about New Year's Eve.

150
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:35,331  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Where's everybody else?
-I sent them home.

151
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:39,122  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
You are such a good boss.
Is she pretty?

152
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,849  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:488 Y2:523
Answer faster. Answer faster.

153
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:46,772  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I don't know.
-Answer better. Answer better.

154
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,725  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't think of her that way.
I mean, she's a colleague.

155
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,845  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What does she do there?
-She's regional vice president.

156
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,402  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:523
-She's just below me.
-She did what?

157
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,524  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Below me.

158
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:07,128  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:523
Wait, is Wendy the runner-up
Miss Oklahoma?

159
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,885  X1:297 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?!

160
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:12,243  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:523
Well, she didn't win.

161
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,291  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, maybe I should let you...

162
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:18,326  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and the second prettiest girl
in Oklahoma get back to work.

163
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:22,367  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
Second prettiest that year. Of all
the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably--

164
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:23,972  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
Chandler, stop talking.

165
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:28,487  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:442 Y2:523
Honey, there's really
nothing to worry about.

166
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:30,843  X1:263 X2:453 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Okay.
-I'm serious.

167
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:32,247  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

168
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,127  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

169
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:39,047  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Merry Christmas, you guys.
-Merry Christmas.

170
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:47,649  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:523
-The wife says hi.
-Fun conversation?

171
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:50,765  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, she's just got
this weird idea that...

172
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:54,084  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:523
...because you and I are alone
something's gonna happen.

173
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:56,209  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

174
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:59,613  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:488 Y2:523
Would that be so terrible?

175
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:04,451  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is probably the wrong thing
to be worrying about...

176
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:08,288  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:442 Y2:523
...but you're getting ham
on my only tie.

177
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:17,645  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Back off, missy!
-Missy?

178
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,367  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know. I'm not used to girls
making passes at me.

179
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:24,412  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait a minute.
Am I sexy in Oklahoma?

180
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,724  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You are to me.
-No. No. No!

181
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:34,129  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Look, I'm married.
-So? I'm married.

182
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,130  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm happily married.

183
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:38,802  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:486 Y2:523
What's that like?

184
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:43,932  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Right. So I'm sorry, but--
-Seriously? Happily married?

185
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:47,085  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
So that phone call before,
that was happy?

186
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:50,365  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, look, it's not easy
to spend this much time apart.

187
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:52,689  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:442 Y2:523
She's entitled to be
a little paranoid.

188
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:55,413  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
Or, in this case, right on the money.

189
00:12:56,493 --> 00:13:00,771  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know, she's amazing
and beautiful and smart.

190
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:04,403  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
And if she were here right now,
she'd kick your ass.

191
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:12,092  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
Look, you're a really nice person,
ham-stealing and adultery aside.

192
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,566  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
But what I have with my wife
is pretty great.

193
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,645  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:523
So nothing's ever gonna happen
between us.

194
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:22,323  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, let me ask you something.

195
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:25,929  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
If what you and your wife have
is so great...

196
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:29,210  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
...then why are you spending
Christmas with me?

197
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:33,041  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
You were the most beautiful woman
in the room tonight.

198
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,532  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Really?
-Are you kidding?

199
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:38,571  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:523
You're the most beautiful woman
in most rooms.

200
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,568  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:442 Y2:523
What's going on?
You and I just made out.

201
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:51,088  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You and I are making out?
-Well, not anymore.

202
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:55,488  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:442 Y2:523
-But we don't do that.
-I know. I just thought it would be fun.

203
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:59,485  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
-How drunk are you?
-Drunk enough that I wanna do this.

204
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:02,770  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
Not so drunk that you should
feel guilty about taking advantage.

205
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,409  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's a perfect amount.

206
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,211  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You know what's weird?
-What?

207
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:16,688  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:523
-This doesn't feel weird.
-I know.

208
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:21,847  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:523
-You're a really good kisser.
-Well, I have kissed over four women.

209
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:26,683  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
You wanna get under the covers?
Okay.

210
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:36,571  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow, you are really fast.

211
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,810  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

212
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:44,091  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:442 Y2:523
-We're gonna see each other naked.
-Yep.

213
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:46,813  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You want to do it at the same time?
-Count of three?

214
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,406  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:448 Y2:523
-One.
-Two.

215
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:50,564  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Three.

216
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,172  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I think it's safe to say
that our friendship is effectively ruined.

217
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:00,887  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
We weren't that close anyway.

218
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:05,082  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:523
Are you really gonna go out
with that nurse-man?

219
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:08,369  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, you and I
are just goofing around.

220
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,003  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought, why not
just goof around with him?

221
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:18,086  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know if you've ever looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

222
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,448  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, I have.

223
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:25,408  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
And the technical definition
is two friends...

224
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:31,603  X1:121 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
...who care a lot about each other
and have amazing sex...

225
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:38,091  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and just want to spend
more time together.

226
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:41,290  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you have this newfangled dictionary
that gets you mad at me...

227
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:45,002  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:523
...then we have to, you know,
get you my original dictionary.

228
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:49,365  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am so bad at this.

229
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,448  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:442 Y2:523
I think you're better
than you think you are.

230
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:56,282  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Really? Okay. So if--?
-Know when to stop.

231
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:58,449  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
I sensed that I should stop.

232
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:01,569  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So we're okay?
-Yeah.

233
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:07,487  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Don't do the dance.
-Right.

234
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:11,487  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't get married without
something old, something new...

235
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:14,121  X1:078 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...something borrowed, something blue.
-Okay, okay.

236
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,528  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here's something blue and new.

237
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:19,122  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
You are so efficient. I love you.

238
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:20,602  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Let's go.
-No, no, wait!

239
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,411  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:523
We need something old.

240
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:26,652  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay. I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.

241
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,565  X1:260 X2:454 Y1:486 Y2:523
That'll work!

242
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,485  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't think so.

243
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:34,044  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. Now we just need
something borrowed.

244
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:39,282  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Here, just take this.
-That's stealing.

245
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:41,927  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:442 Y2:523
We'll bring it back.
Just put it under your dress.

246
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:55,009  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, one thing at a time.

247
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:58,969  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Listen...

248
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:01,612  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
...l've been thinking.

249
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:06,642  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's not fair for me to ask you to spend
all of your money on our wedding.

250
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:09,771  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, you work--
You work really hard for that.

251
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:12,089  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well....
-Well, you work for that.

252
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,527  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
Look, I've thought about it too.
And...

253
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:21,130  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:442 Y2:523
...I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

254
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:25,847  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You do?
-Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.

255
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,529  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, look, when I proposed...

256
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:33,652  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I told you that I would do anything
to make you happy.

257
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:37,328  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy, then....

258
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:39,370  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
Then that's what we're gonna do.

259
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,766  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are so sweet.

260
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:48,811  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:523
But wait. What about our--?
What about the future and stuff?

261
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:52,608  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
Forget about the future and stuff.
So we only have two kids.

262
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:56,766  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, we'll pick our favorite,
and that one will get to go to college.

263
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,083  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You've thought about that?
-Yeah.

264
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:04,132  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
-How many kids were we gonna have?
-Four. A boy, twin girls...

265
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,648  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and another boy.

266
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:09,329  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What else did you think about?
-Well...

267
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:13,722  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:523
...stuff like where we'd live, you know.

268
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:18,211  X1:071 X2:644 Y1:448 Y2:523
Like a small place outside the city
where our kids could ride bikes and stuff.

269
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:21,888  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:523
And we could have a cat
that had a bell on its collar...

270
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:25,762  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

271
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:30,051  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:442 Y2:523
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.

272
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,203  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know what?

273
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:40,211  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't--
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

274
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:42,763  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Sure you do.
-No.

275
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:46,607  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:523
I want everything
that you've just said.

276
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:49,128  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:523
I want a marriage.

277
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:51,763  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:523
You sure?

278
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,492  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

279
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:15,132  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I love it!
-Really? You're not gonna return it?

280
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,732  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, not this second.

281
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:21,762  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, look, you guys. It's snowing!

282
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:30,092  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Wow, it's so beautiful.
-Wow, it really is.

283
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:35,251  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wendy's a fat-girl name.

284
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,802  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:486 Y2:523
Aren't we done with that?

285
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:41,886  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, fine. Fine.
Let's talk about snow.

286
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:47,449  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa where
my husband's having sex on a copier?

287
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,247  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.

288
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,561  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:523
Look at that.
That's a Christmas miracle!

289
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,407  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to be with you.

290
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:05,245  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
I missed you so much.

291
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,564  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey, hey. Who'd you miss the most?
-Monica.

292
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,529  X1:292 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gotcha.

293
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:18,251  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I never want to leave you again.
-I thought if you left, you'd get fired.

294
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:21,763  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:442 Y2:523
Turns out they can't fire me.
Because I quit.

295
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:25,523  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-What? You--? You really quit your job?

296
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:29,043  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. It was a stupid job,
and I could not stand leaving you.

297
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,882  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why should I be the only one who
doesn't do what he really wants to do?

298
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:37,803  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well, what do you really wanna do?
-I have not thought this through.

299
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:41,809  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I should've talked to you first.

300
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:45,050  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I think that this is what
you wanna do. I think it's great!

301
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,730  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks.

302
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:52,802  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Chandler, your being here is the best
Christmas present I could ever imagine.

303
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,682  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Now give me my real gift.
-Yeah.

304
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,809  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Thank you.
-Here, pass those around.

305
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:10,971  X1:075 X2:644 Y1:442 Y2:523
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

306
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:14,883  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:523
How did you know?

307
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:18,887  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:523
What? Are you kidding?
I can't return this.

308
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,129  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's time we started thinking about
other people.

309
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,807  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
And besides, this gift still says,
"I love you guys."

310
00:21:25,013 --> 00:21:28,642  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Mine says, "To Lillian Myers."
