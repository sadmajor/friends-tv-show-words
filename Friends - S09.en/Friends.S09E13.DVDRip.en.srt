1
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:05,901  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.

2
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:08,863  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look, can we talk
about what happened here last night?

3
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:12,660  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
Sure. Just give me a second
to get all huffy and weird like you.

4
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:18,418  X1:073 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
You believe that whoever did something
last night did what they did or didn't do?

5
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,579  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay, you really don't know
what I'm talking about?

6
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:24,140  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No.
-Okay. Last night, after the party...

7
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:27,741  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I saw Rachel kissing that jerk
from her office out on your balcony.

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,298  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:523
Our balcony? Seriously?

9
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:32,696  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's so funny. I told Monica
we should put lights on our balcony...

10
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,380  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and she said, "No, no. It's too cold.
Nobody will go out there." And I said:

11
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:38,900  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Maybe if we put some lights
out there they will."

12
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:44,700  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
Right, that's what I came over to talk
about. I saw Rachel kissing some guy...

13
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:48,460  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
...on your balcony,
even though there were no lights!

14
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,219  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
So are you gonna talk to her?

15
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:56,100  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:523
Why? Why should I? I mean,
if she wants to move on, that's fine.

16
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:59,741  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know when "that's fine" sounds
true? When someone yells it and spits.

17
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:04,981  X1:100 X2:620 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, I'm serious. I mean, if she wants
to date people, fine. I don't care.

18
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:07,215  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:488 Y2:523
But at least she could have told me.

19
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:10,741  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, I've been putting my life on
hold and concentrating on Emma.

20
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:16,338  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
But if she wants to go out there kissing
guys she barely knows, then so will I.

21
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:21,414  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:523
Very funny! Ross is gay!

22
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,657  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no.
Good, so you're moving on.

23
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:27,214  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you have any idea
where you're moving on to?

24
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:29,222  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
I've got plenty of opportunities.

25
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:33,697  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:523
Just now, there was some woman
at the coffeehouse smiled at me.

26
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:39,178  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
And then the other day on the subway,
a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.

27
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:43,977  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
Dude, don't rub my face
in your crazy single life.

28
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:46,775  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:523
And there's an anthropologist
at school...

29
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:50,540  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
...who totally came on to me during
the interdepartmental potluck dinner.

30
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,259  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why did I get married?

31
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:57,016  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
The One Where Monica Sings

32
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:44,705  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:054 Y2:094
Hey, let me ask you guys something.

33
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,583  X1:173 X2:547 Y1:054 Y2:129
I'm having new headshots
taken tomorrow.

34
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:49,942  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:054 Y2:133
The photographer said she thinks
I should have my eyebrows waxed.

35
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:52,300  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:054 Y2:094
Is that weird for a guy?

36
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,575  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well, it depends.
-On?

37
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:57,504  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
On how far along he is
in the sex-change process.

38
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:02,893  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:054 Y2:134
No, I totally disagree. I think it's fine
for a guy to do something like that.

39
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:04,578  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:054 Y2:094
Especially an actor.

40
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,538  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, not that you need to.
Your eyebrows are....

41
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:14,258  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,
you're freaking me out.

42
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:16,660  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:054 Y2:094
Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.

43
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,025  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, man, now I have to get
those done too?

44
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:24,104  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:054 Y2:133
-Wow, talk about high maintenance.
-You dye your hair.

45
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:27,377  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I'm a woman.
-Double standards!

46
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,458  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:054 Y2:133
Before I forget, are you coming
to Mike's piano bar tonight?

47
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:35,340  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:054 Y2:134
-Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
-But everybody sings. It's so fun.

48
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:39,498  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:054 Y2:133
Last time, this adorable old man got up
there, forgot all the words, flipped out...

49
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:43,863  X1:076 X2:643 Y1:054 Y2:133
...and everyone booed him off the stage.
It was so funny.

50
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:47,375  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:054 Y2:095
Look, I'm not good at singing.

51
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:51,544  X1:106 X2:614 Y1:054 Y2:134
Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
You afraid I'm a better singer?

52
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:53,821  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:442 Y2:523
You afraid I'm gonna beat you
at singing?

53
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:59,335  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.

54
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,417  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow, I must be growing up.

55
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:08,223  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, fine. Just please come and
support Mike. You don't have to sing.

56
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:12,384  X1:073 X2:646 Y1:442 Y2:523
So I don't have to sing, and I can just sit
there and pass judgment on others?

57
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,735  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:523
-While drinking.
-I'm there.

58
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:19,534  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hi, you guys.
Listen, I really need your help.

59
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,100  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think I did something
really stupid.

60
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:25,780  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something
so beautiful out of it.

61
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:30,978  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, not that.
I kissed Gavin last night.

62
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,220  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:523
-My God.
-You kissed him?

63
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,853  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, it was after the party,
we were on the balcony--

64
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:38,262  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:523
Wait, wait, wait. I was at home
the whole time. How did I miss that?

65
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:42,424  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, it was the end of the party. You
were probably ironing wrapping paper.

66
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,738  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, yeah.

67
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,142  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
So how did you end up kissing?

68
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,575  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
We were all alone
and he was being really nice...

69
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:54,817  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...and he gave me this scarf.
-I thought you hated him.

70
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:57,624  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, there is a thin line
between love and hate...

71
00:04:57,785 --> 00:05:02,176  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and it turns out that line
is a scarf.

72
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,419  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are you thinking of starting
something up with this guy?

73
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:09,497  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know. It's so complicated.
I work with this guy.

74
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:13,055  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:523
I have the baby, and I have Ross.
I don't know what to do.

75
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,342  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:523
And I have to be at the office
and see Gavin in 10 minutes.

76
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:19,935  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
Sounds like you need to think
about what you want and talk to Gavin.

77
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:23,893  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:523
-And you definitely should talk to Ross.
-Or...

78
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:27,497  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
...I could call in sick
and not deal with it at all.

79
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:31,338  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wow! Five months maternity leave,
you're back for four days...

80
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:35,623  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
...kiss a co-worker and call in sick.
They are lucky to have you.

81
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:44,300  X1:322 X2:396 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hi.
-Hi.

82
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:49,061  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
-Name?

83
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,937  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:523
Chandler Bing.

84
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,704  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, very good.

85
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:57,937  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,
and Sonya will be right with you.

86
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,096  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Thanks.

87
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:46,463  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
I touched the stuff.

88
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,415  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'll take care of it.

89
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:54,744  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks.

90
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:57,863  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
So do you...?
Do you get a lot of guys in here?

91
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,698  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, absolutely.
-Oh, good.

92
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:04,375  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You looking to meet somebody?
-All right, let's just do this.

93
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:08,059  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.

94
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,864  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
First, I want to tweeze
some of the strays, okay?

95
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:14,813  X1:104 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Now, this may sting just a little bit.
-I have an extremely high threshold--

96
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:18,898  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:523
Holy Mother of God!
Oh, my face! My face!

97
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,900  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

98
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:30,296  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's just a bit of shock, that's all.

99
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:34,743  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:442 Y2:523
-But I'll be fine. You can go again.
-Okay.

100
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,697  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:482 Y2:523
Sorry.

101
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:47,180  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:486 Y2:523
Damn it, woman!

102
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:03,221  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's the most eligible man in New York.
How's the moving on going?

103
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,704  X1:097 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
Not well. I went on the subway again
and someone did sit on my hand...

104
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:12,653  X1:100 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but that person was neither female
nor wearing pants.

105
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,813  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
Maybe you're going about this
the wrong way. I mean, think about it:

106
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:22,263  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:444 Y2:523
Single white male, divorced three times,
two illegitimate children.

107
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:26,945  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
The personal ad writes itself.

108
00:08:27,905 --> 00:08:31,693  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, that's funny. Yeah.
So do you think you'll ever work again?

109
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,296  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
What are you doing?
You know I can only dish it out.

110
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:41,337  X1:107 X2:613 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't believe Rachel just moved on
and didn't say anything to me.

111
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,063  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe she didn't move on.

112
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:46,695  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,
one-time birthday thing.

113
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:49,743  X1:088 X2:633 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, a month ago, she gave her number
to some guy in a bar.

114
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,936  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Did she go out with him?
-No. When he called...

115
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,538  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I threw the message away.

116
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:57,216  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:523
The highroad.

117
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:02,223  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, you know what? Enough.
Enough talking. I have to get moving.

118
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:07,256  X1:127 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, check out those two blonds
over there. Hey, come with me.

119
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,979  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are you trying to get
everybody divorced?

120
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,895  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
You don't have to do anything.
It'll just be easier if it's two of us.

121
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:18,217  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
Like college, remember? First, you
break the ice with some kind of a joke...

122
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:22,298  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:442 Y2:523
...so they know you're the funny one. I
swoop in with interesting conversation...

123
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:26,538  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:442 Y2:523
...so they'll see that I'm the brilliant,
brooding sexy one.

124
00:09:29,465 --> 00:09:31,740  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
I thought I got to make the jokes.

125
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:36,502  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Don't you have to be at work?
-Oh, come on.

126
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:43,855  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.
This is my friend Ross right here.

127
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:45,538  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
We were wondering...

128
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:49,539  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:442 Y2:523
...if you're up for it, we only need
six more people for a human pyramid.

129
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:53,264  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:523
Swoop. Swoop.

130
00:09:57,145 --> 00:10:00,774  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, I notice
you're reading the paper.

131
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:03,175  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
Another flood in Europe, huh?

132
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:07,456  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here's a question:

133
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:13,620  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:523
Would you rather drown
or be burned alive?

134
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:19,137  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm sorry, we're just leaving.
-Okay.

135
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:23,783  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:523
We still got it.

136
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,344  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Who is it?
-Gavin. I brought you some soup.

137
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,894  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Why?
-I heard your were sick.

138
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:42,774  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, right! Hold on,
let me just clean up in here a little bit.

139
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,101  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hello, Gavin.

140
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:57,856  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
I missed you at work.
How you feeling?

141
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:01,614  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.

142
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,822  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, good. Because I was having
a totally paranoid moment...

143
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:07,101  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
...where I thought you
called in sick to avoid me.

144
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:10,103  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, no, no, no.

145
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:14,742  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
So I had fun last night.

146
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:17,296  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:488 Y2:523
So did I.

147
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:22,021  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
Exactly how contagious
is this thing you have?

148
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:27,213  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
Is it a cold from standing on
the balcony, or did a monkey bite you?

149
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:30,498  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:442 Y2:523
-It's just a cold.
-Do you have a fever?

150
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:32,860  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let me see.

151
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:39,983  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:523
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

152
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:42,534  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:442 Y2:523
What's Ross doing to you
in that picture?

153
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:46,300  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.

154
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,744  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
He thought it would be funny.

155
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:52,055  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Right. Right.
-Yeah.

156
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:54,136  X1:303 X2:415 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Ross.
-Yeah.

157
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:57,977  X1:087 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
What's the deal with you guys? I don't
wanna get in the middle of anything.

158
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:02,975  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're not getting in the middle
of anything. Don't worry about Ross.

159
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,460  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hide! That's Ross! Hide!

160
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,220  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hide! Hide!
-Yeah, but you said not to worry--

161
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:11,058  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:442 Y2:523
I lied and I'm not sick either!
Just stay behind the curtain!

162
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,943  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi.
-Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.

163
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,858  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:442 Y2:523
No. I'm here to take Emma
to your mother's, remember?

164
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:22,578  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:523
Right. Yes, yes.

165
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,500  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Don't panic.
-What?

166
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:27,815  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:523
There is a man behind your curtain.

167
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:31,455  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I have Mace in my purse.
-No, that's okay! No, no, no.

168
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:36,460  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is my business associate Gavin
being silly. Come out from behind there.

169
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:40,657  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.

170
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:43,940  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
It was my idea to stand there.

171
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:48,223  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Hello. I'll just go get Emma.
-Okay.

172
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,461  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:523
So...

173
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,254  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...why did I have to hide?
-I thought it was Ross.

174
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,098  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought there was nothing
going on between you.

175
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,182  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
There isn't. There totally isn't.

176
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:05,736  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
You hear keys in the hall and you jump
like a bronco coming out of the chute.

177
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:10,015  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:488 Y2:523
I used to be a rodeo clown.

178
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:15,265  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, look, Gavin...

179
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:21,454  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I guess I felt guilty
that you were here...

180
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,536  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:486 Y2:523
...which I shouldn't.

181
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:27,141  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, Ross and I
are not in a relationship...

182
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:31,662  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but he is the father of my child.
And, you know...

183
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:35,301  X1:079 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
...we do live together. And plus,
there's just so much history, you know?

184
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,296  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's just--
I don't know.

185
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:41,424  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.
-It's okay.

186
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:45,377  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's probably not my place,
but can I give you a piece of advice?

187
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:48,855  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Yes.
-You should talk to Ross about all this.

188
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:52,220  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:523
People keep saying that.

189
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:56,376  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry, Gavin.

190
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,137  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:486 Y2:523
Don't be.

191
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,865  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's just bad timing.

192
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:04,175  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:523
So seriously, rodeo clown?

193
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,585  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
One of the best, ma'am.
One of the best.

194
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:38,380  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, she's my girlfriend.
That's not just how we do it here.

195
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,014  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm gonna take a little break,
and when we come back...

196
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:44,416  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:442 Y2:523
...we've got Kenneth singing
"I Touch Myself."

197
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:47,625  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm not here to judge.

198
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:54,017  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You have got to sing.
-No, I told you I can't.

199
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:57,535  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
But you would have so much fun.
And you have a really nice voice.

200
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:01,143  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
-When have you heard me sing?
-All the time, when you're cooking.

201
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:02,858  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-Yeah, you're always singing:

202
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,698  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yummy, yummy, yummy
I've got love in my tummy

203
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:08,577  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:486 Y2:523
Yeah, I do rock that one.

204
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:13,742  X1:124 X2:596 Y1:442 Y2:523
Isn't there just a little part of you
that wants to get up there?

205
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:17,816  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.

206
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,896  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't even know what I would sing.

207
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:22,665  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well, I've got a book around--
-"Delta Dawn."

208
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:36,059  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hi. I couldn't help but notice,
but that's an unusual necklace.

209
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:38,978  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
You already hit on me an hour ago.

210
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:44,100  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
Right. So that's a firm no?

211
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:52,543  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't believe this.
I just keep striking out.

212
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:55,054  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't get it either.

213
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:57,819  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
I mean, you're obviously desperate.

214
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:01,660  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're asking women
how they wanna be killed.

215
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:04,817  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is great.
Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys...

216
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:08,694  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
...until she finds the one she wants,
and I'm gonna die alone.

217
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:11,738  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:523
By drowning or...?

218
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:17,144  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Why would he break up with me?
-I don't know, sweetie.

219
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:21,423  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:523
All I ever wanted was to just love him
and have him love me back.

220
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:25,180  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:486 Y2:523
I mean, am I so unlovable?

221
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:28,337  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Wow.
-I know.

222
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:40,705  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right. That was Kenneth with his...

223
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:44,494  X1:166 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
...much too literal rendition
of "I Touch Myself."

224
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:48,704  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
Coming up next, we've got Monica
singing "Delta Dawn."

225
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:51,654  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:442 Y2:523
Wait. I can't sing in
front of all these people.

226
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,140  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:442 Y2:523
Just pretend they're not
even here. It's okay.

227
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,776  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:442 Y2:523
Once that spotlight hits you, it's so
bright, you won't see anyone anyway.

228
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:05,776  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hi, I'm Monica. And I'm going
to be singing "Delta Dawn."

229
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:33,263  X1:092 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Can you totally see through her shirt?
-Like an x-ray.

230
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:37,017  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
Bad day not to wear a bra.

231
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:51,334  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:482 Y2:523
I need your help.

232
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,296  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:486 Y2:523
Wow, it seems serious.

233
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:58,897  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
What seems to be the problem,
Ashley Judd?

234
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:02,899  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm getting new headshots taken.
So I went to get my eyebrows shaped.

235
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,903  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry.
Moment to make fun of that, please.

236
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,544  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:442 Y2:523
I may be a sissy, but I'll still
pound you into the ground.

237
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:14,420  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look, it hurt so bad, I could only
let her do one eyebrow, and now...

238
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:17,224  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
...they don't match!

239
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:32,974  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's like a baby caterpillar
chasing its mama.

240
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,182  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
You got to help me out, okay?
Look, I have a magic marker.

241
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:39,178  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
Fill in the skinny one
so I don't look stupid for my pictures.

242
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,853  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, first of all, this is green.

243
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,978  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What the hell am I supposed to do?!
-I will help you out...

244
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:49,582  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:442 Y2:523
...but you have to promise you won't
tell anyone what I'm about to tell you.

245
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,259  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:523
What? What?

246
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:53,859  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

247
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,017  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know how most kids get their
allowance from mowing the lawn...

248
00:18:57,185 --> 00:19:01,576  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:523
...or taking out the garbage?
Well, I earned mine...

249
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:07,456  X1:076 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
...by plucking the eyebrows of my father
and his "business partners."

250
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:13,617  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

251
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:17,222  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need
my help, VictorVictoria.

252
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:20,337  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no, no. I do. I do.
I need your help.

253
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:24,015  X1:078 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
But, Chandler, I don't know if I can take
any more plucking. It hurt so bad.

254
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:28,776  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
Not with my combination of ice cubes,
aloe vera and my gentle...

255
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:32,335  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
...self-loathing touch.

256
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:49,904  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry, the song's over.

257
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:55,222  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Did you see me up there?
-Every little bit of you.

258
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:59,855  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't believe I sang
in front of people and they liked me.

259
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,539  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Did you hear that guy shouting,
"Look at those tips"?

260
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:06,414  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, did I really help
you get a lot of tips?

261
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:07,654  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sure.

262
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:12,741  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Mon, not that you didn't sound good....
-Good?

263
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,221  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
Didn't you hear them? I was great!

264
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:20,856  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thank you so much for making me
do this. That is the best gift ever.

265
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:23,704  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
Also a good gift: underwear.

266
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,819  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

267
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:33,938  X1:091 X2:628 Y1:442 Y2:523
Public bathrooms freak me out. I can't
even pee, let alone do anything else.

268
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:37,815  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:442 Y2:523
But what's great is, you don't
mind talking about it.

269
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:42,422  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
It is so amazing that I met you on the
same day that Eric broke up with me...

270
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:46,294  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
...because it's like, you lose a boyfriend,
and you get a boyfriend.

271
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:53,300  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, don't worry. This is not some
rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.

272
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,619  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:486 Y2:523
Good choice, Ross.

273
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,415  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey. Hi. There you are.

274
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,061  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:446 Y2:523
-I've been looking for you everywhere.
-Hello. Well, here I am.

275
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:13,098  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
My mom is not bringing
the baby back until 9:00.

276
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:17,622  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:523
So I was hoping you and I
could have a chance to kind of--

277
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,664  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Somebody here?
-Oh, yeah. That's Michelle.

278
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,862  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Who?
-Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.

279
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:30,542  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:523
-You've been seeing someone?
-Yeah, didn't I mention that?

280
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:33,503  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, we haven't been
going out too long...

281
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:37,374  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:523
...but there's this amazing
connection between us.

282
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:41,174  X1:084 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, in fact just before you came in,
she called me her boyfriend.

283
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:45,224  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:523
I thought it was a little too soon,
but also, it felt kind of nice.

284
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,940  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you taking amoxicillin for?

285
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:59,017  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
How great is this?
You're already comfortable enough...

286
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,779  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
...to look through my stuff.

287
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,300  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, Michelle,
this is my roommate, Rachel.

288
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:06,496  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:486 Y2:523
And I'm also Emma's mother.

289
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,581  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Who's Emma?
-I told you about my daughter.

290
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:13,100  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:523
This is your daughter?

291
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:16,453  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
I could be your new mommy.

292
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,417  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:523
And done.

293
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:30,140  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

294
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:33,263  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
I didn't feel a thing.
Hey, are you still looking for a job?

295
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:36,855  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:523
Because you could tweeze circles
around that sadistic bitch at the salon.

296
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:41,297  X1:087 X2:632 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Thanks. Wanna see what it looks like?
-Yeah.

297
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:46,016  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:444 Y2:523
They totally match.
They look great.

298
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:49,222  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
They look great. How you doing?

299
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:53,502  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yeah, I think it looks pretty good.
I was a little worried I was...

300
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,304  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:523
...uncovering a birthmark
right about there...

301
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:59,423  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but it turned out to be
a little piece of chocolate.

302
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,059  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Chandler, thank you so much.
-No problem.

303
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:05,535  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
Listen, that was a pretty
girlie hour we just spent.

304
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:08,060  X1:139 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
We should do something manly
to make up for it.

305
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,341  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

306
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:15,740  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Curl my eyelashes.
-Yeah!

307
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:23,455  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
For my next song, I think I'll sing
something a little more upbeat, all right?

308
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:27,459  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:523
How about the Pointer Sisters'
"I'm So Excited"?

309
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,855  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
And make it bouncy.

310
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:32,858  X1:079 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, you can probably take care of that
on your end.

311
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:37,573  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry I'm late. You'll understand
when you see Joey.

312
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:41,181  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
Honey, you're just in time.
I'm about to sing another song.

313
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,979  X1:108 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Really? In front of all these people?
-And they love me.

314
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:48,218  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, my God.
-She gives the people what they want.

315
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,819  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, watch.

316
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,137  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are those my wife's nipples?

317
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:14,253  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:442 Y2:523
Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before.
I wouldn't have let her go up again.

318
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:17,258  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
I've got to stop this.

319
00:24:29,705 --> 00:24:32,424  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
Who cares? They still love me.

320
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:39,100  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:523
You, touching yourself ! Out!

321
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,661  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow! She does that a lot.

322
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:51,455  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:442 Y2:523
Ross, you didn't tell me
you were a doctor.

323
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:54,657  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
Wait a minute. You haven't even
told her you are a doctor yet?

324
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:56,702  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:523
How long have you known her,
like an hour?

325
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:59,897  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually, about an hour and a half.

326
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:04,456  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:442 Y2:523
I told you it wasn't long, but there's
an amazing connection between us.

327
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,855  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:488 Y2:523
You feel that too?

328
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:11,541  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I thought that that was just me.
-Are you kidding?

329
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:15,493  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Do you wanna go away this weekend?
-We'll see.

330
00:25:16,545 --> 00:25:17,978  X1:158 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:523
Ross, what's going on here?

331
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:20,978  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are we just bringing strange women
back to the apartment now?

332
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,579  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know. Are we just kissing
guys on balconies?

333
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,575  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
-How do you know about that?
-Through the magic of sight.

334
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:34,657  X1:087 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I was here, putting our child to sleep--
-Emma.

335
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,623  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
When I looked through the window
and saw you kissing a guy...

336
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,696  X1:114 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
...you've known for what, a week?

337
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:45,540  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:444 Y2:523
God, is that what this is all about?
You bring her up here to get back at me?

338
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:49,101  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, actually, see, I had to pee
because I can't use public bathrooms...

339
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:53,417  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...because of the doody parasites.
-Okay, Michelle, it's time to go.

340
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,224  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well, call me.
-Okay.

341
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:58,097  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:442 Y2:523
Wait, you don't have
my phone number.

342
00:25:58,305 --> 00:26:01,342  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what?
If it's meant to be, I'll guess it.

343
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:05,015  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:482 Y2:523
Bye-bye.

344
00:26:05,705 --> 00:26:07,582  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
Score.

345
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:10,339  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
Did you not like her? Because I was
hoping we could come...

346
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:12,461  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
...to your kissing parties
on the balcony.

347
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:16,055  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:448 Y2:523
I can't believe you are making a big deal
about this. It was one kiss!

348
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:18,739  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
-One guy. One time!
-Oh, really?

349
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,459  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah.
-Oh, really?

350
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:24,857  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, yeah.

351
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:27,704  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What about the guy from the bar?
-Who?

352
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:30,897  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
The guy you gave your number to.

353
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:35,183  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
-How do you know about that?
-Because he called here looking for you.

354
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:39,304  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:442 Y2:523
So don't tell me kissing this guy
from work is a one-time thing.

355
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:42,656  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
Because you've been out there
in bars and on balconies...

356
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:46,818  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
...for over a month now. And you
don't even have the courtesy to tell me.

357
00:26:47,665 --> 00:26:50,384  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Why didn't I get that message?
-What?

358
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:54,174  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
From the guy in the bar?
Why didn't I get that message?

359
00:26:54,385 --> 00:26:57,422  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because I folded it up
and put it in my pants pocket.

360
00:26:57,585 --> 00:27:00,622  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do you not look there?

361
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:03,984  X1:309 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ross.

362
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,974  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
I never gave it to you.

363
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,783  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why?

364
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:14,985  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I don't know.
-Oh, God, you know what? I don't....

365
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:17,784  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to decide...

366
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:20,743  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
...what messages
I should or should not get?!

367
00:27:21,065 --> 00:27:23,738  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:442 Y2:523
Who am I? I'm the guy
who's taking care of our baby...

368
00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:27,056  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:442 Y2:523
-...while you're at bars meeting guys!
-I cannot believe you.

369
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:31,264  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:523
I actually came in here hoping to have
a mature conversation about us.

370
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:33,893  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:442 Y2:523
But I can't do that with someone
who hides my messages...

371
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:36,784  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and brings crazy women
back to my apartment!

372
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:41,103  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hey, none of the sane ones
wanted to come back with me!

373
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,583  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's not the point, okay?
The point is...

374
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:50,624  X1:126 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
...you are the one who moved on
and didn't tell anyone.

375
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:54,784  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, God, Ross,
this is just so messed up.

376
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:58,904  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
What is wrong with us? When people
hear about our situation, they ask:

377
00:27:59,105 --> 00:28:01,983  X1:123 X2:598 Y1:442 Y2:523
"You live together, but you're not
a couple, yet you have a baby?

378
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:06,138  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:446 Y2:523
Isn't that weird?" And I say,
"No. It's not, because it works for us."

379
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:08,176  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:523
But you know what?
This doesn't work.

380
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:12,304  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
-In fact, this is the opposite of working.
-Clearly.

381
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,623  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:523
And you know...

382
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:19,334  X1:093 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
...we said that we would live together
as long as this makes sense...

383
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:23,703  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and maybe this
just doesn't make sense anymore.

384
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,580  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, maybe not.

385
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:31,140  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, what do you wanna do?

386
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:36,903  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hi.

387
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:40,375  X1:096 X2:624 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can Emma and I live here for a while?

388
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,860  X1:313 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
God.

389
00:28:43,545 --> 00:28:47,254  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Of course.
-Thank you.

390
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:53,984  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
Your eyebrows look weird.

391
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:21,023  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:054 Y2:134
So you'll just touch yourself
for anything, then?

392
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:25,814  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:444 Y2:523
