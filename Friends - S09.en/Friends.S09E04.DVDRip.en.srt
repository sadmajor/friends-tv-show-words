1
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:03,802  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Ross.

2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:07,488  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm so glad someone's here.
Could you zip me up?

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,486  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Sure.
-Thank you.

4
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:14,167  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
Can you believe no one
between my apartment and here...

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,403  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:523
...offered to do that for me?

6
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:18,052  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:523
People.

7
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,771  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
So why are you so dressed up?

8
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,049  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Mike's picking me up for a date.

9
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:27,046  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:442 Y2:523
How's that going?
Is it getting serious?

10
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:30,523  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:446 Y2:523
I don't know. I don't know.
I mean, I like him.

11
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:33,890  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
But am I ready to take
my Grade A loins off the meat market?

12
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:36,089  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm not quite sure.

13
00:00:37,573 --> 00:00:41,407  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, I really admire
your whole dating attitude.

14
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,565  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's so healthy. I'm always like,
"Is this moving too fast?

15
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:47,201  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
Is this moving too slow?
Where's this going?"

16
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:50,251  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know.
You are a bit of a drama queen.

17
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:55,091  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're so much better off. You just
go from guy to guy having fun...

18
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:59,371  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and not worrying that it
never turns into anything serious.

19
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,649  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
I wouldn't say "never."

20
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:04,008  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know, there is that guy.

21
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:06,610  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, well, what about...?

22
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:09,687  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, there's gotta be someone.

23
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:14,404  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:442 Y2:523
-There isn't! That's what I'm saying.
-Oh, my God, you're right!

24
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:18,043  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know. And yet, here you are,
all ready for the next date.

25
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,131  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:523
I can't believe I never
realized this before.

26
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:26,366  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm in my 30s, and I've never been
in a long-term relationship.

27
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:29,206  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?

28
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,645  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
There's nothing wrong with you.

29
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:39,933  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, you don't strike me as the type
of person that wants to get married.

30
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:42,368  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
I want to get married!

31
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,842  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, please--
Please don't cry because of me.

32
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:49,689  X1:098 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know what I'm talking about,
okay? I've been divorced three times.

33
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,445  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
At least you've been married.

34
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,923  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, my God!
I want to trade lives with Ross?!

35
00:01:57,773 --> 00:01:59,650  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Phoebe.

36
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,652  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:442 Y2:523
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I'm excited about our date.

37
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:08,644  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:523
Mike, this is Ross Geller.
Ross, this is Mike--

38
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,643  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Sorry, I didn't catch that.
-Mike Hanigan.

39
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,485  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Ross Geller.
-Hey.

40
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:17,691  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
So are you sure you're ready to go?

41
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:20,365  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
How do I look?

42
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:25,249  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Do you have a compact in your purse?
-No.

43
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:27,250  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:523
You look great.

44
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:32,049  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
The One with the Sharks

45
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:10,372  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey, Joey.
-This girl won't turn around.

46
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:13,923  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:054 Y2:134
I can't tell if she's hot or not.
What do you think?

47
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:18,006  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:054 Y2:133
Joey, I am not going
to objectify women with you.

48
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:20,443  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:054 Y2:128
But if her face is
as nice as her ass....

49
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:22,729  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Mama!
-All right. Thanks.

50
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:26,363  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Have you talked to Chandler?
-He has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.

51
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,842  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:054 Y2:128
-How come?
-I don't know. He has to work.

52
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:31,766  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:054 Y2:095
There's some big rush on the....

53
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:39,648  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:054 Y2:134
Damn it. I'm gonna have to start
listening when he talks about his job.

54
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:43,011  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:054 Y2:134
Why don't you fly out there
and surprise him?

55
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:45,448  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:054 Y2:094
Maybe I will go.

56
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:50,647  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:054 Y2:129
We'll have a little second honeymoon
at the Tulsa Ramada.

57
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:56,171  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:054 Y2:133
You should bring your black see-through
teddy with the attached garters.

58
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:02,972  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
-How do you know I have one of those?
-Didn't until just now.

59
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,408  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hot. Not hot.

60
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:10,006  X1:317 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hot!

61
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:11,762  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse me?

62
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:17,487  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:523
I said that I think you're hot.

63
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:20,611  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:486 Y2:523
And...now I'm embarrassed.

64
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:23,043  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
I thought you said "hi."

65
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,689  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:486 Y2:523
That would've been better.

66
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:28,925  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll try that. Hi, I'm Joey.

67
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:30,287  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm Hayley.

68
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:36,281  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:523
Look, I don't normally ask out women
that I meet in coffeehouses.

69
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,246  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gesundheit.

70
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,847  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
-But--
-I would love to go out with you.

71
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:51,811  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really? Great.

72
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:54,567  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:523
Did l--?
Did I actually ask you?

73
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,850  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's just where you were going.
I figured I'd help you out.

74
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:02,564  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:523
You don't seem like the kind of guy
who does this a lot?

75
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:07,443  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
You should see someone
about that cold.

76
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,446  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
If it gets much worse, you could die.

77
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:16,492  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:446 Y2:523
-So how'd the date go?
-Well, it was awful.

78
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:19,213  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
Every time I thought about
what you said, I cried.

79
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:22,046  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:442 Y2:523
-So he hasn't called?
-Would you call this girl:

80
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:25,285  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Thanks for...a lovely...evening"?

81
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:28,568  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:444 Y2:523
Now I feel terrible.
This is all my fault.

82
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,167  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know what you should
feel terrible about?

83
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,403  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:523
This could have been my serious guy.

84
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:35,962  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
He was sweet and smart and funny.

85
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:38,408  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know how hard it is
to meet a guy like that?

86
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,923  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are a rare breed.

87
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,371  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
What a great dinner.

88
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:51,526  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thanks again for letting me have that
last piece of cake at the restaurant.

89
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:55,724  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're welcome again.
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

90
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:58,407  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Can I get you anything?
-Do you have any cake?

91
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:06,363  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:523
So this is going pretty good.

92
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,650  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
Dinner was nice.
We've got a lot in common.

93
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:11,769  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Victoria's Secret.

94
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,651  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:488 Y2:523
We even like the same books.

95
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:18,531  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
There's a scary painting.

96
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,652  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wait a minute.

97
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,328  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think I've been scared
by that painting before.

98
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:28,081  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what?
This whole place looks familiar.

99
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,289  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have definitely been
in this apartment.

100
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:33,172  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know I've seen
this weird plant before.

101
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:36,527  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:488 Y2:523
It did that the last time!

102
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:39,526  X1:118 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
I've gone out with this girl before.

103
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:41,968  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah! We had sex on this couch!

104
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,727  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
And then on that chair, and--
No.

105
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,690  X1:171 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, we didn't do it here...

106
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:50,562  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
... which is weird, because it seems
like a perfectly good place.

107
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,246  X1:265 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's why.

108
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:04,171  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hey, Mike. Sorry to just drop by
like this. Can I come in?

109
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,732  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sure.

110
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,931  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
Who are you?

111
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:11,291  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm Ross. Phoebe's friend
from the coffeehouse?

112
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:15,082  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
I really, really need to talk
to you about something.

113
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:16,402  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:523
Unless....

114
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:20,725  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're not gonna try
and get me to join a cult, are you?

115
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:25,329  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, it's just, you know,
you have that look.

116
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:28,453  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:482 Y2:523
Damn Supercuts!

117
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:33,729  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Well, what's up? Is Phoebe okay?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

118
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:37,010  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe is great. But....

119
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:39,084  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm an idiot, okay?

120
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:43,610  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
Right before you guys went out,
I accidentally got her all upset.

121
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,886  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's why she was weird.

122
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:51,252  X1:085 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yes. I said something stupid about her
never having had a serious relationship.

123
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:55,292  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
But you should know, she is
so much fun. A wonderful person.

124
00:07:55,453 --> 00:07:59,446  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Please, don't blow her off.
-I'm not gonna blow her off.

125
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,446  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just spoke to her.
We're going out tomorrow night.

126
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:07,482  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, I hope that's okay with you,
stranger from the coffeehouse.

127
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:10,812  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, then, I didn't need
to bother you.

128
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:14,932  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
You or the four other
Mike Hanigans I bothered.

129
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:21,042  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Is that true what you said?

130
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:24,444  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:442 Y2:523
Phoebe's never had
a serious relationship?

131
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,611  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:488 Y2:523
Of course she has.

132
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:29,202  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:442 Y2:523
If she's never had
a serious relationship...

133
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:31,568  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:442 Y2:523
...do you think I'd go
around broadcasting it...

134
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,931  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
...like some kind
of unstoppable moron?

135
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:41,052  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:446 Y2:523
-But you did say it.
-Yes. Yes, I did.

136
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:44,728  X1:208 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I will also say...

137
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:47,407  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:523
...what I'm about to say...

138
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:50,004  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
...vis-à-vis...

139
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:52,243  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:523
...the following.

140
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:58,932  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:523
Phoebe has never had
a serious relationship...

141
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,806  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
...since...

142
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:05,489  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:523
...her super-serious relationship...

143
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:06,847  X1:287 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
...with...

144
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,492  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:523
...Vikram.

145
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:12,612  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Vikram?
-What? That's a real name.

146
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:23,051  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:482 Y2:523
Stop it!

147
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:26,011  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:523
Why couldn't they have
sent me to Texas?

148
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:28,849  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:486 Y2:523
Seven o'clock.

149
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:31,084  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe I'll hit the gym.

150
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:39,690  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:444 Y2:523
Who am I kidding?
Pay-per-view porn.

151
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:55,926  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Do not disturb! Do not disturb!
-Surprise!

152
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:00,613  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Monica?
-ls everything all right?

153
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:02,604  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah, everything's great.
I was just...

154
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:05,571  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
...watching some
regular television there.

155
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:08,806  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
What a pleasant surprise.

156
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:19,210  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm gonna go freshen up, okay?
-Okay, honey.

157
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:25,971  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
That was close.

158
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,732  X1:212 X2:501 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hello.
-Hey, Rach, it's me.

159
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:35,011  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay, I just got to Chandler's room,
and I caught him...

160
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:37,129  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
...molesting himself.

161
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:40,884  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
That couldn't have been pretty.

162
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:43,089  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
But you know, guys do that.

163
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:44,686  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, the weird part is...

164
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:48,163  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:523
...he was getting off...
to a shark-attack show!

165
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:53,050  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No!
-Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!

166
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:00,444  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:523
-While watching sharks?
-Yeah.

167
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,843  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:442 Y2:523
Are you sure that's what
he was doing?

168
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:05,811  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know how many times
I've seen him jump up like that?

169
00:11:05,973 --> 00:11:07,884  X1:087 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:523
Believe me, I know what he was doing.

170
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:11,288  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:488 Y2:523
Man! Sharks!

171
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:14,684  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:523
I always knew there was something
weird about that dude.

172
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,091  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:523
You promised to love him
no matter what.

173
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:21,246  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:442 Y2:523
"What" means, like, if he
gets a disease or kills someone.

174
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:25,248  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.

175
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,209  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what, honey?
Guys are just different.

176
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:30,841  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:523
They like things
that we can't understand.

177
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:33,243  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
I once dated this guy
who wanted to pretend...

178
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,450  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:523
...that he was an archeologist,
and I was this...

179
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:41,403  X1:109 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:523
...naughty cavewoman
who he unfroze from a block of ice.

180
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:44,930  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you talking about my brother?

181
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,163  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
I didn't disguise that very well, did I?

182
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:50,962  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Hi.

183
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:55,092  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
I went out with this girl last night.
Halfway through our date I realized...

184
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:56,811  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I already slept with her.

185
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:02,971  X1:078 X2:638 Y1:442 Y2:523
You've slept with all the women in N.Y.,
and now you're going around again?

186
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,566  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's not even the weird part.

187
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:08,726  X1:084 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
-She didn't remember sleeping with me!
-You don't remember sleeping with her.

188
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:12,408  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
But she should remember sleeping
with me. I am very memorable!

189
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,404  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You guys know.
-How do we know?

190
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:18,645  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:523
-We've never slept with you.
-And whose fault is that?

191
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:22,163  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:442 Y2:523
What's the big deal?
You forgot, she forgot.

192
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,131  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Maybe you were having an off night.
-Hey!

193
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:30,361  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
I never have an off night. Okay?

194
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:33,764  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
Although, sometimes if I'm
a little bloated, I don't feel that sexy.

195
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,572  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:523
But even then, I'm better than most!

196
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:40,365  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:442 Y2:523
Honey, why don't you just let it go
and ask her out again?

197
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:43,366  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're both so slutty, you don't
remember who you slept with.

198
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,046  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:486 Y2:523
You're made for each other.

199
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:48,690  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
Interesting.

200
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:53,164  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I'll go out with her again
and I'll try to get past it.

201
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,893  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
No salt! Bloaty!

202
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:57,452  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Joey?
-What?

203
00:12:57,613 --> 00:12:59,444  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
You don't think
sharks are sexy, do you?

204
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,285  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

205
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:04,332  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:446 Y2:523
Wait a minute.
Wait, what was the Little Mermaid?

206
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:10,004  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's open!

207
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:14,811  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Mike called! We're going out again!

208
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:20,088  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:523
Quick thing.
I went to talk to Mike.

209
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:21,527  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

210
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:24,048  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
What did you--?
What did you do, Ross?

211
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:27,125  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.

212
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,571  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:523
I went over there, you know,
to tell him how....

213
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:34,169  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
How great you are. But....

214
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,927  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, you know me.
Blah-blah-blah.

215
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:42,722  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:523
-And I ended up telling him that....
-What?

216
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,805  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
You had a six-year-long relationship...

217
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:49,009  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:523
...with a guy named Vikram.

218
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:52,569  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? Why?

219
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,247  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, he seemed...

220
00:13:55,413 --> 00:14:01,090  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:442 Y2:523
...to bum hard when I told him you'd
never been in a serious relationship.

221
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,012  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:442 Y2:523
If you hadn't just had a baby
with my best friend...

222
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:10,404  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:488 Y2:523
...I swear to Lucifer...

223
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:15,363  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
...a rabid dog would be feasting
on your danglers right now!

224
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:18,811  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:442 Y2:523
I think you'll feel differently
when you know...

225
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,203  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:488 Y2:523
...a little bit about Vikram.

226
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:23,684  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, he's a....

227
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:26,890  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
He's a kite designer.

228
00:14:28,773 --> 00:14:31,890  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:523
And he used to date Oprah.

229
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:37,208  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm not going along
with some lie you made up, Ross.

230
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,682  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I'm just gonna be honest with him.
-Good.

231
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:41,127  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just be honest with him.

232
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:43,682  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I have nothing to be ashamed of.
-No.

233
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:48,131  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:442 Y2:523
So I haven't been in a relationship
that lasted longer than a month.

234
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,648  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.

235
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:55,250  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:523
If he can't handle it,
then he can leave. Which he will.

236
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:58,883  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:442 Y2:523
And, you know, that's okay.
So I'll just be alone forever.

237
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:01,692  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know, all right.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

238
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:05,323  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'll go on walking tours
with widows and lesbians.

239
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,484  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'll get it.
-Okay.

240
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:16,212  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm trying to remember the last time
I opened a door and you weren't there.

241
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:21,773  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe, are you okay?

242
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:26,605  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah. There's just....

243
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:29,967  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
There's something you should know.

244
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:34,811  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
Vikram just called.

245
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,891  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
So it was really a shock
after 25 years of marriage...

246
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:41,851  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:523
...my parents getting divorced.
I took it the hardest...

247
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:44,368  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:523
-...because I was the youngest.
-Sure. Yeah.

248
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:47,001  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
How can you not remember me?

249
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:48,682  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

250
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:50,730  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
How could you not remember
that we slept together?

251
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:53,771  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What? When?
-I don't know!

252
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,484  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
I really, really think
I would remember sleeping with you.

253
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:00,929  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come on, come on.
Search your brain, all right? It was...

254
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,563  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:523
...a certain amount of time ago.
I was here. You were here.

255
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,088  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:486 Y2:523
We had sex here, here, here....

256
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:09,084  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not there.

257
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:12,245  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Anything?
-No, it's not ringing any bells.

258
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:14,483  X1:232 X2:483 Y1:482 Y2:523
My God, woman!

259
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:17,406  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:523
How many people have you been with
not to remember this?

260
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:20,565  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, Hayley.
We really gotta fix that doorknob.

261
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,322  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey?

262
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,689  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
I slept with you!

263
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:35,048  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
And you obviously remember me!
Hey, I still got it!

264
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:37,329  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
So we're good.

265
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,003  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll let myself out.

266
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:44,566  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I said, "Okay, Vikram...

267
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:48,043  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:442 Y2:523
...you can't just call
every time you get lonely.

268
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:51,523  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
You gave up that right
when you slept with Rachel."

269
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,928  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
Rachel? I thought she just
had a baby with Ross.

270
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,970  X1:255 X2:459 Y1:486 Y2:523
Yeah, well....

271
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,885  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

272
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:01,932  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:442 Y2:523
But Emma's birth certificate
might say "Geller" ...

273
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:05,165  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
...but her eyes say "Mukherjee."

274
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:10,127  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
That is so wrong.
And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?

275
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:13,091  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know. But he calls,
and my heart goes to him.

276
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:18,327  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, that bastard is one
smooth-talking freelance kite designer.

277
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:22,610  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
I think there's somebody
better out there for you.

278
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:26,288  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, you know, I'm--
I'm not saying me, but....

279
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:29,528  X1:263 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe...me.

280
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,851  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
And you don't have to worry about
glue-sniffing with me.

281
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,403  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
Although, I do smell
the occasional Magic Marker.

282
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,486  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah. Anyway, I just....

283
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,128  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think I can make you happy.

284
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,802  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Okay, I can't do this.
-What's wrong?

285
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:54,852  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, there is no Vikram.
Ross made him up.

286
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:56,412  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because I....

287
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:59,371  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
I really never have been
in a long-term relationship.

288
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:03,890  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
I've never lived with a guy. I've never
even celebrated an anniversary.

289
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,771  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
So....

290
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:09,811  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
If that's too weird for you...

291
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,043  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and you want to leave,
I understand.

292
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:15,489  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:523
In fact, I'll close my eyes
to make it less awkward.

293
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:24,649  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
You kissed me.

294
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:30,165  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You don't think I'm a total freak?
-No.

295
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,925  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well....

296
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:34,212  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:486 Y2:523
Look, can I...?

297
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:37,285  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:523
Can I think you're a little weird
and also cool...

298
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:40,013  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
...for telling me the truth
and also want to kiss you?

299
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:42,289  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:523
I guess so.

300
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,808  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:442 Y2:523
Can I think it's cool
that you kissed me...

301
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:47,441  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and also want to kiss you again?

302
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:53,092  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
And be a little concerned
about the Magic Markers?

303
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:55,124  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:523
Definitely.

304
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,682  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is Vikram.

305
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:13,928  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi, honey, I'm home.

306
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,807  X1:326 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hi.

307
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:19,409  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
-How was your flight?
-lt was great.

308
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:21,450  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why don't you sit down.

309
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,012  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Get yourself comfortable.

310
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,733  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because I have a little...

311
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:28,043  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
...surprise for you.

312
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:31,607  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, well, well.
It must be 5:00 in Tulsa...

313
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:35,448  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:486 Y2:523
...because it's "sex o'clock" in N.Y.C.!

314
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:41,285  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay.
This is how much I love you.

315
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:44,329  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
The great white....

316
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,286  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey?

317
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:54,769  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why am I watching
a bunch of sharks swimming around?

318
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:58,088  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
Is this--?
Is this not the good part?

319
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:02,485  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you want me to fast-forward
to something...toothier?

320
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:06,727  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, I'm just not sure that you
got the right movie, that's all.

321
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:10,281  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is the only one
they had at our video store.

322
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:13,445  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:523
Though they did have something
called Crocodile Killers.

323
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:16,286  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
Or does it always have to be sharks?

324
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,289  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
Does what always have to be sharks?

325
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,569  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, we can do something else.

326
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:26,692  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you want me to
get into the tub and...thrash?

327
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:31,644  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:442 Y2:523
-What's going on?
-lt's okay. It's okay.

328
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,565  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:523
I still love you.

329
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,521  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Let me be a part of this.
-Let me be a part of this!

330
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:41,009  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
I saw what you were doing in Tulsa.

331
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,812  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:523
Angry sharks turn you on!

332
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,646  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, they don't.

333
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:51,252  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then why were you watching them
and giving yourself a treat?

334
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:54,964  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, my God! When you came in,
I switched the channel.

335
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,647  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
I was just watching regular porn.

336
00:20:58,773 --> 00:20:59,842  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

337
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:04,131  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yes. Just some good, old-fashioned,
American, girl-on-girl action.

338
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:09,125  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:523
Can I tell you how happy
that makes me?

339
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:13,406  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
You are an amazing wife.

340
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,804  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
Really, you are amazing. You were
actually gonna do this for me?

341
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:21,091  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
Where do you find the strength
and the understanding for that?

342
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,966  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm very, very drunk right now.

343
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:34,923  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ordinarily, I would talk to her,
but my confidence is shaken.

344
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,130  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
Did I sleep with her?
Did I not sleep with her?

345
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:43,084  X1:078 X2:638 Y1:054 Y2:133
Maybe this is a wake-up call. You know,
about your whole dating attitude.

346
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:48,043  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:054 Y2:134
You're in your 30s and you have
never been in a long-term relationship.

347
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,204  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:054 Y2:094
Here you go from woman to woman...

348
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:52,648  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:133
...meaningless experience
to meaningless experience.

349
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:56,328  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:054 Y2:134
Never even worrying that it doesn't
turn into something more serious.

350
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:59,485  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:054 Y2:095
You're right. I love my life!

351
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:05,768  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:054 Y2:094
I actually did sleep with her.

352
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:11,642  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:054 Y2:133
