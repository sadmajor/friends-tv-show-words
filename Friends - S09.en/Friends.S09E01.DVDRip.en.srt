1
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:10,090  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey?

2
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,524  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:17,042  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

4
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:32,370  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:523
So I guess we should
make it official, huh?

5
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:35,972  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:486 Y2:523
Look, Rach, I....

6
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:40,406  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, Ross is here!
Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross!

7
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:43,366  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey, Ross.
-Hey, Joey.

8
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:46,364  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.

9
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:51,806  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
And he brought flowers! Thanks, Ross.
I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.

10
00:00:53,693 --> 00:00:54,762  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're weird today.

11
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,283  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

12
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:04,048  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. Actually, I kind of need
to talk to you too.

13
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:06,932  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Joey, could you give us a minute?
-No.

14
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:12,652  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-I'm sorry. I meant, ''No.''

15
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:14,852  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi. Hey, look who's here.

16
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:18,850  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:442 Y2:523
Where's my granddaughter?
I've been practicing my magic tricks.

17
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:21,726  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:523
He pulled a quarter out of my ear.

18
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:25,167  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Hey, where's Mom?
-She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.

19
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:27,933  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:442 Y2:523
Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $5 each!

20
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:33,682  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:523
So when do I get to meet Emma
and show her this:

21
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:36,171  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, wow.

22
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:40,081  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:442 Y2:523
Emma's in the nursery.
I'll take you now if you want.

23
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:43,643  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
-But I really want to talk to you.
-I know. I still need to talk to you.

24
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,128  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
But before you guys do that,
I need to talk to you.

25
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,086  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
And, Ross, I need to talk to you.

26
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,523  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:523
-And I need to talk to you.
-About what?

27
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:55,248  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
To see if you know
what these guys are talking about.

28
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,489  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
The One Where No One Proposes

29
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,203  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:486 Y2:523
Isn't she beautiful?

30
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:46,844  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:054 Y2:094
Look at her, my first grandchild.

31
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:51,612  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:054 Y2:089
What about Ben?

32
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,206  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:054 Y2:133
Well, of course, Ben.
I meant my first granddaughter.

33
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:04,449  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:054 Y2:133
Have you thought any more
about you and Rachel?

34
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:07,810  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:054 Y2:133
Yeah, actually I was gonna talk to her
when you guys came in the room.

35
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:12,131  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:054 Y2:129
That's so exciting! Wow.
You could've done that with us there.

36
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,165  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah, right.
-Sure. Okay.

37
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,530  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:054 Y2:133
You can touch yourself in front of us,
but you can't talk to Rachel.

38
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:22,049  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:054 Y2:133
What? When have I ever
touched myself in front of you guys?

39
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:27,571  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:054 Y2:133
Oh, please. Just before,
when you were asleep in the lounge.

40
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,691  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:448 Y2:523
That Armenian family was watching you
instead of the TV.

41
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:37,364  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:054 Y2:133
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian
still has my Game Boy.

42
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:40,087  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

43
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:44,325  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:054 Y2:094
Dude, I just did something terrible.

44
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,083  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
That was you? I thought it was Jack.

45
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:51,886  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no. That was Jack.
Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.

46
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:56,530  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What? Why does she think that?
-Because it kind of looked like I did.

47
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,652  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:523
Again, what?

48
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:01,932  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, I was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand--

49
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,522  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
As we all are at some point
during the day.

50
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:08,168  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:442 Y2:523
It wasn't my ring.
It fell out of Ross' jacket...

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,325  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and when I knelt down to pick it up,
Rachel thought I was proposing.

52
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,524  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ross had a ring?
And he was gonna propose?

53
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,725  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I guess.
-And you did it first?

54
00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:19,965  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is gonna kill him. You know
how much he loves to propose.

55
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,689  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:486 Y2:523
I know. I know. It's awful.

56
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:25,168  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, what did she say?

57
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,971  X1:235 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:523
She said, ''Yes.''

58
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,089  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:488 Y2:523
Does Ross know?

59
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:33,086  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
What the hell am I gonna tell him?

60
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:35,682  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Maybe you don't have to tell him.
-I like that. Yeah.

61
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:39,327  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:523
If you clear things up with Rachel,
Ross never needs to find out.

62
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:42,291  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
But you have to do it before
he hears about it and kicks your ass.

63
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:45,530  X1:109 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, let's not get carried away.

64
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:48,372  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
I want a baby.

65
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:52,526  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
Honey, we've been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.

66
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:57,924  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:442 Y2:523
If we have sex again, it'll double
our chances of getting pregnant.

67
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:01,847  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I think that closet's still available.
-I am so tired.

68
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:09,085  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Yeah, okay, but no foreplay.
-Deal!

69
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:15,041  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:523
Dad, seriously!

70
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:20,206  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know, you really should
see someone about that.

71
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:22,170  X1:301 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
Noted.

72
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:27,012  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.
Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

73
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:31,371  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are you kidding me?
I could stay and look at her forever.

74
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,604  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually....

75
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:41,251  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Hi.

76
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:43,643  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you all right?

77
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:49,811  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I think I just got engaged.
-Oh, my God! He did it?

78
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:52,049  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
What? Did you know
he was gonna ask me?

79
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:56,411  X1:080 X2:635 Y1:446 Y2:523
Are you kidding?
I'm, like, the one who talked him into it.

80
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:00,202  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
I like to think of myself
as the puppet master of the group.

81
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:05,042  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:444 Y2:523
-And you really think this is a good idea?
-I just talked him into it.

82
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,852  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:523
Don't tell me I have to do you too?

83
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:11,528  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
-The puppet master gets tired, people.
-Okay.

84
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:14,293  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.

85
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:17,963  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why? You two are so meant
to be together. Everybody thinks so.

86
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:20,488  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really? Even Ross?

87
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:24,446  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:523
Especially Ross.

88
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:30,732  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hey, Pheebs. You know what?
I'll come back later.

89
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:35,413  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow. Kind of a full house here.

90
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:40,249  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
I guess I'll just-- I'll come back.

91
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:45,525  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:523
There he goes. Your fiancé.

92
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,843  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:523
I guess so.

93
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,449  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
Although he does
play with himself in his sleep.

94
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:54,565  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't say I'm surprised.

95
00:06:57,493 --> 00:07:01,247  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Dad, what are you doing?
-There are people in there having sex.

96
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,530  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
It can't be me. I'm standing right here.

97
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,686  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Wanna peek?
-No!

98
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:10,888  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on.

99
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:14,811  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what?
I don't like you without Mom.

100
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,969  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on.

101
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:20,366  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're not peeking?

102
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:24,083  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, I'm peeking.

103
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,652  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

104
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:31,886  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hello, sir. You know Monica.

105
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,127  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey, is it okay to come in?
-Of course.

106
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:53,087  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:523
Joey, this ring, I--
It's beautiful. I love it.

107
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:58,611  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. Look, Rach,
there's something I gotta tell you.

108
00:07:58,773 --> 00:07:59,808  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Hi.

109
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:04,046  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Are you ready to try nursing again?
-Yeah. Hi, Emma.

110
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:06,124  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why do you think
she won't take my breast?

111
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:08,568  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's all right.
It takes babies a while to get it.

112
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:11,293  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:442 Y2:523
-But don't worry, it'll happen.
-Okay.

113
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:18,602  X1:089 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.

114
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,806  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dear Lord.

115
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:26,922  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:446 Y2:523
-I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
-Yeah, look, I think that--

116
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:29,891  X1:076 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because, look! She's pulling away again.

117
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,608  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you think my nipples
are too big for her mouth?

118
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,769  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:523
She looks scared.
Doesn't she look scared?

119
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:42,090  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know, I don't really know her.

120
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,092  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:523
Why don't we try massaging
the breast to stimulate the flow?

121
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:48,569  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay.
-Are you kidding me?

122
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,332  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is so frustrating.
Why doesn't she want my breast?

123
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,764  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!

124
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:00,133  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey, wait up.
-Hi.

125
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:01,965  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Congratulations.

126
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:05,205  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
I didn't want to say anything in front
of Joey. I didn't know if he knew.

127
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:08,769  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
What? That we had a baby?
Now let's give him a little credit.

128
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:12,243  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Although he did eat a piece
of plastic fruit earlier.

129
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,973  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no, that you
and Rachel are engaged.

130
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:18,691  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:446 Y2:523
-What?
-Oh, it's a secret?

131
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:22,926  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:442 Y2:523
Goody. Yes! We haven't done
the secret thing in a long time.

132
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:27,002  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?
I didn't propose.

133
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:28,208  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you lying?

134
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:32,645  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
Is this like that time you tried
to convince us you were a doctor?

135
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:38,488  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am a doctor!

136
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:43,051  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know what? I'm just gonna go
and talk to Rachel myself.

137
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:45,681  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right. Well, me too.

138
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,686  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well, should we wake her up?
-No. No. Come on, let her sleep.

139
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:55,085  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:442 Y2:523
-She's so exhausted.
-And so engaged.

140
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:09,168  X1:082 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged!

141
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,966  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why? Why, why would
she think we're engaged?

142
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:16,091  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
Perhaps because you gave her
an engagement ring?

143
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:18,847  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, Ross,
doctors are supposed to be smart.

144
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:22,409  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I didn't give her that ring.
-You didn't?

145
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:24,768  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No!
-So whose ring is it?

146
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:27,130  X1:283 X2:433 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's mine.

147
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,010  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Is it an engagement ring?
-Yes.

148
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,931  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:523
-But you didn't give it to her?
-No.

149
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,089  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:523
-But you were going to propose?
-No!

150
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:37,890  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
I might be losing interest in this.

151
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:41,604  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look. Look, my mom
gave me that ring...

152
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:43,729  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
...because she wanted me
to propose to Rachel.

153
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,009  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:488 Y2:523
But all I wanted to do was see...

154
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:49,848  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
...if she maybe, kind of wanted
to start things up again.

155
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:52,487  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:488 Y2:523
What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

156
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:56,724  X1:083 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:523
I didn't want to rush into anything.
It seemed like she didn't want to either.

157
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:59,771  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:442 Y2:523
But I don't understand
how any of this happened.

158
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:03,721  X1:079 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
What, did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume I was gonna propose...

159
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:07,124  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
...throw it on
and just start telling people?

160
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,131  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no. She said you
actually proposed to her.

161
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:15,248  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, I didn't! I didn't propose!

162
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:17,525  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:523
Unless....

163
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:21,045  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did I?

164
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:29,491  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:523
I haven't slept in 40 hours and....

165
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:35,604  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
It does sound
like something I would do.

166
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,448  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, we can't stay in here forever.

167
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,806  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's just, I still can't believe
that my dad saw us having sex.

168
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:54,086  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
He didn't make it to one
of my piano recitals, but this he sees!

169
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:58,247  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:442 Y2:523
This is okay. We're all adults here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

170
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:01,962  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
Now, let's put our underwear
in our pockets and walk out the door.

171
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,969  X1:291 X2:424 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hi, Dad.

172
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:15,527  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I can still call you that, right?
-Of course. I'll always be your dad.

173
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:20,483  X1:085 X2:629 Y1:446 Y2:523
I just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.

174
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,605  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:442 Y2:523
-It wasn't fun?
-Why, why, why would you...?

175
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,567  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, I just don't want you to think...

176
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,293  X1:143 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
...that we're animals who do it
whenever we want.

177
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:33,085  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:523
Well, I don't think that.

178
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,928  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Before today, I never thought
of you two having sex at all.

179
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:39,607  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:523
It was a simpler time.

180
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,371  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.

181
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,928  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.

182
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:48,209  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

183
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:50,682  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, get back in there!
I'll guard the door!

184
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,651  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:523
That's okay, Dad,
we can wait until later.

185
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:55,849  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:442 Y2:523
Whoa! I don't think so.
Aren't you ovulating?

186
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:58,170  X1:299 X2:417 Y1:482 Y2:523
Daddy!

187
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:59,886  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:523
You gotta get at it, princess.

188
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:02,089  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
When your mother and I
were trying to conceive you...

189
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,721  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:523
...whenever she was ovulating,
bam, we did it!

190
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:06,372  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's how I got my bad hip.

191
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:11,372  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's funny. This conversation's how
I got the bullet hole in my head.

192
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:15,009  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
This one time I had my knee
on the sink, and your mother was--

193
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:19,086  X1:078 X2:636 Y1:442 Y2:523
Daddy, I don't think we need to hear
the specific positions you and Mom had.

194
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:21,807  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're right.
This is about your positions.

195
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:25,443  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Now, what I saw in the closet
is not the optimum position...

196
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:27,649  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:523
...for conceiving a child.

197
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:31,408  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Although it might feel good.
-I don't feel good right now.

198
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:35,322  X1:072 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
But pleasure is important,
and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.

199
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:38,684  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:523
You up to the task, sailor?

200
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:41,851  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Seriously, sir,
my brains, all over the wall.

201
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,566  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Hey. Oh, I need to tell you something.

202
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:55,564  X1:084 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, now's a good time.
I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.

203
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:57,445  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey asked me to marry him.

204
00:13:57,773 --> 00:13:59,570  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-Joey proposed to me.

205
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:03,971  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
-Well, I said yes.

206
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:06,812  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
What, are you crazy?
You just had Ross' baby!

207
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,922  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's so inappropriate.
No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.

208
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:14,722  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
It is bigger than mine!

209
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:19,086  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know. Days of our Lives,
thank you very much.

210
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:21,528  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You can't marry him.
-Why not?

211
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,049  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
Come on, I don't want to do this alone,
and he's such a sweet guy.

212
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:26,646  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
And he loves me so much.

213
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:28,047  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, do you love him?

214
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,528  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sure.

215
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:36,166  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Sure?
-Yeah, I mean, whatever.

216
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,012  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, the question is...

217
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:40,811  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
...do you really want to marry Joey?

218
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,285  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

219
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:47,172  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I don't.

220
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,962  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:523
Could you be a dear and go tell him?

221
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:55,603  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:442 Y2:523
You still haven't told Rachel
you weren't proposing?

222
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:58,048  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
No. She had the ring on...

223
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:01,165  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:523
...she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.

224
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:06,329  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
Joey, you have to tell her what's
going on. And what did it look like?

225
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:08,848  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:486 Y2:523
I didn't look at it.

226
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:11,243  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:442 Y2:523
The stupid baby's head
was blocking most of it.

227
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:14,807  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:523
Go and tell Rachel right now,
before Ross finds out.

228
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:18,283  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
Look, it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.

229
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,967  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't want to hurt her.

230
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,563  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, look, just do it gently.

231
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:25,842  X1:261 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're right.

232
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:29,847  X1:080 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're right. I'll go tell her now
before Ross finds out, and I'll be gentle.

233
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:34,086  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can do that. I am a gentle person.

234
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:38,451  X1:092 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
By the way, two people screwing
in there if you want to check that out.

235
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,926  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey.

236
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:49,771  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey.

237
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,844  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
Listen, I heard about the engagement.

238
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,492  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:523
Surprised?

239
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:02,292  X1:248 X2:466 Y1:488 Y2:523
And confused.

240
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:08,284  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:486 Y2:523
Rach, sweetie...

241
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:10,926  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I didn't propose to you.

242
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:14,523  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know.

243
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:18,452  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't think you do.

244
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,127  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:523
You didn't propose to me.

245
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:25,761  X1:282 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey did.

246
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:29,323  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:523
Poor baby, you're so tired.

247
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:35,327  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
Rach, I didn't propose to you.

248
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:38,326  X1:161 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey didn't propose to you.

249
00:16:38,493 --> 00:16:43,408  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
And Chandler didn't propose to you.

250
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:47,528  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:523
You didn't propose to me.

251
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:50,651  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
Chandler didn't propose to me.

252
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,531  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
But Joey did.

253
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,573  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey proposed to you?

254
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,930  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I can come back.
-Wait. Wait. Wait.

255
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:02,489  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Joey, did you propose to her?
-No.

256
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:06,932  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yes, you did.
-Actually, technically, I didn't.

257
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:10,443  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well, then, why did you give me a ring?
-Wait.

258
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:16,768  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You gave her the ring?
-No, and I did not ask her to marry me.

259
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:18,292  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

260
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:19,602  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

261
00:17:19,813 --> 00:17:22,611  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yes, you did, and don't
you say you didn't!

262
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,571  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
He was right there. He got down
on one knee and he proposed.

263
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:28,008  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:523
-You were down on one knee?
-Yeah, that looks bad.

264
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:32,530  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
But I didn't propose.

265
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,327  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Then what did happen?
-Yeah, what did happen?

266
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:38,491  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, the ring fell on the floor,
and I went down to pick it up...

267
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:41,884  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and you thought I was proposing.

268
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:46,006  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, but you said,
''Will you marry me?''

269
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:48,010  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:442 Y2:523
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

270
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:51,410  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:442 Y2:523
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.

271
00:17:57,413 --> 00:17:59,881  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Why didn't you tell me that before?
-Well, I tried...

272
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:04,285  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but people kept coming in,
and then you took your breast out.

273
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,167  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
You saw her breast?

274
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,292  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.

275
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:17,246  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then what the hell were you
doing with an engagement ring?

276
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:19,921  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:523
It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.

277
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:24,570  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's why I felt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.

278
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,092  X1:297 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?!

279
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,125  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
You were gonna propose to me?

280
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:35,726  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

281
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,205  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, this is awkward.

282
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:54,850  X1:079 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
But I was going to see if, you know,
maybe you wanted to start dating again.

283
00:18:55,013 --> 00:19:00,645  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
-But that, I mean, that was all, Rach.
-Dude, step up. I proposed.

284
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,531  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, you didn't.

285
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:08,006  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:448 Y2:523
That's right. There's a lot going on here,
and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

286
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:15,131  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hey, she just woke up. She's hungry.
Why don't we give this another try?

287
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,688  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't believe you told her
I was gonna propose.

288
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:21,482  X1:078 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I can't believe you're not gonna.
-Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.

289
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,649  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, dude, I totally understand.

290
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:27,123  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
Usually after I have a baby with
a woman, I like to slow things down!

291
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:29,806  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Oh, my God!
-What?

292
00:19:30,013 --> 00:19:31,651  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:442 Y2:523
She's doing it!
She's breast-feeding!

293
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,052  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's beautiful.

294
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:37,642  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'll come back for her later.
-Thank you.

295
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:43,970  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Wow, this feels weird.
-What, good weird?

296
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:46,129  X1:231 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wonderful weird.

297
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:50,126  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what, you guys?
I'm gonna go too.

298
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:54,366  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I'm sorry about everything.

299
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:58,248  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.
-No, Rach, I should've told you sooner.

300
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,051  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's just that....

301
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,010  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
Man, that kid is going to town!

302
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,443  X1:251 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
She's perfect.

303
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:20,763  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're so lucky.

304
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:23,009  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:523
We really are.

305
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:32,127  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:442 Y2:523
Look, I know it's not a proposal,
and I don't know where you are...

306
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:36,047  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:442 Y2:523
...but with everything that's been
going on and with Emma, I'm....

307
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:39,967  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:446 Y2:523
-I've been feeling....
-Yeah, I know.

308
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,930  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:523
I've been feeling....

309
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:43,845  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

310
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:48,606  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, well, that--
Wow, okay, well--

00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:52,288  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then maybe at least we can
talk about us again?

312
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:56,447  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah. Maybe.

313
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:58,683  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, good. Okay.

314
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:02,482  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
I kind of think, you know, if we, if--

315
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:08,290  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're wearing the ring.

316
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:14,772  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:486 Y2:523
What's that?

317
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:20,563  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:523
And you told Phoebe
you were engaged.

318
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,488  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry, what?

319
00:21:27,173 --> 00:21:31,724  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
When you thought Joey proposed...

320
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:33,605  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
...did you say yes?

321
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:50,605  X1:073 X2:641 Y1:054 Y2:133
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up
these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.

322
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:54,047  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:054 Y2:128
-Hey, Dad.
-Hi.

323
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:03,244  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:054 Y2:133
Sorry to bother you again,
but could you pass my pamphlets back?

324
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:07,891  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:054 Y2:094
Thank you.

325
