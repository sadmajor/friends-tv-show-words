1
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:05,726
Hey, you guys? What are
you doing tomorrow night?

2
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:09,010
Oh, well, let me see.
I believe I'm....

3
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:11,243
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

4
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:15,444
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.

5
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:17,171
I could fall asleep at a play.

6
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:20,249
-What is it?
-It's a one-woman play called:

7
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:24,452
Why Don't You Like Me?
A Bitter Woman's Journey Through Life.

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,493
-That sounds interesting.
-That does sound interesting.

9
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:32,010
To listen to a woman complain for
two hours. I don't think it gets bet--

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,730
I know! I know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.

11
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:39,282
What more do these broads want?

12
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:42,482
Well, you guys will have a great time.
I promise.

13
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:44,325
What? How come you don't have to go?

14
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:46,006
I wish I could, but I found out...

15
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:49,529
...that I have to be at work really
early the next day, so I can't go.

16
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,207
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.

17
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:55,168
Let's see. Who do I hate?

18
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,652
Oh, sorry.

19
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:00,372
-Oops, sorry.
-Okay.

20
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,046
-Okay.
-Okay. Up we go.

21
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,329
-Oh, gosh, okay!
-All right.

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,768
Can I ask you a question?

23
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:19,848
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...

24
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,085
...and not have it be a big deal?

25
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:26,842
No, I don't think that ever works.
Why?

26
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,208
-No reason.
-No, no. Rachel?

27
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:34,008
-Who do you want to fool around with?
-Nobody! Forget it.

28
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:35,242
Joey?

29
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:37,691
Maybe.

30
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:40,246
-You can't.
-Why?

31
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:41,562
Because!

32
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:48,243
Okay, seriously, did not understand
a word you just said.

33
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:51,403
-In the hall.
-Okay.

34
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:55,770
-You wanna fool around with Joey?
-Yeah.

35
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,323
Ever since I had that dream about him,
I can't get it out of my head.

36
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:02,007
I mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.

37
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:04,733
Who do you know that are friends
that just fool around?

38
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:08,966
Okay. Off the top of my head....
Don and Janet.

39
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,693
-Who are they?
-I know them from work.

40
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,528
-Both of them?
-No, just one of them.

41
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,411
Which one?

42
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:19,373
I don't know.
What were the names I just said?

43
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,206
No, Rachel, things could get
incredibly complicated.

44
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:25,683
You're right. I won't do anything
with Joey. I just thought it--

45
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:30,483
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
a pound of baking soda and a red onion?

46
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,525
What the hell are you cooking?

47
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,164
The One With The Soap Opera Party

48
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:28,046
You guys won't believe
what I have to do for work today.

49
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:32,570
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.

50
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,969
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...

51
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:41,009
...and I have to meet them here
and show them around campus.

52
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:42,242
What's bad about that?

53
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:45,007
I just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...

54
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:48,563
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.

55
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,568
Ross?

56
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,293
What? These aren't suede.

57
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:59,685
Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

58
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,765
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?

59
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:03,922
No.

60
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,485
Hi. Hi, I'm Ross Geller.

61
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:13,292
Oh, hi. I'm Professor Wheeler.

62
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:17,570
Oh, that's-- That's--
That's nice.

63
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:19,487
It's good to meet you.

64
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:22,406
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.

65
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:24,325
No, it's no big deal.

66
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:28,645
If I weren't doing this, I'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.

67
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:30,887
Is he gonna introduce us?

68
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:34,250
I think we're just blurry shapes
to him now.

69
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,283
By the way,
I really enjoyed your paper...

70
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:41,731
...on the connection between geographic
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

71
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:44,733
I wrote that in one night.

72
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,807
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.

73
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,968
Well, we should probably get going.

74
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:54,809
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

75
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,567
Isn't another professor
supposed to come with us?

76
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,324
I don't think so.

77
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:03,207
I'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?

78
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:06,331
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:

79
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:10,281
If you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.

80
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:13,490
An option that many of my students use.

81
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,324
-Shall we?
-We shouldn't wait for him?

82
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:19,610
You know what, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll find us, okay?

83
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:22,048
-Professor Geller?
-Oh, damn it!

84
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:34,887
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

85
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:39,490
Listen, I forgot your address.
Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.

86
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:43,928
What's happening?

87
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:48,204
It's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.

88
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:51,285
I'd love to, but I gotta get up
so early the next day.

89
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:55,002
-You know me, work comes first.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

90
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:59,847
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

91
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:03,768
Stupid Jan Rogers!

92
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,644
You are having a party tonight?

93
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:10,210
I'm kind of having a thing
for the Days of Our Lives people.

94
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:11,692
You weren't gonna tell us?

95
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:14,162
How did you think
you'd get away with that?

96
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,085
I do it every year.

97
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:19,609
You do that every year?!

98
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:21,843
I didn't have to tell you that!

99
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,767
God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers!

100
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,805
That's why you got us tickets
to that play, to get rid of us!

101
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,008
Yeah.

102
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:33,483
Last year is that why you sent us
to that Medieval Times restaurant?

103
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:34,802
Yeah.

104
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:40,090
The year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?

105
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:43,211
I can't believe you guys went
for that one.

106
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:45,568
Why wouldn't you invite us
to your parties?

107
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:49,886
You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.

108
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:52,806
Well, then, so just invite me.

109
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:56,490
Please, I was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.

110
00:06:56,653 --> 00:07:00,487
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. I will behave. I promise.

111
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,009
-I will behave. Please, please, please.
-Okay, fine. You can come.

112
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,643
But don't tell anybody else.
It's up on the roof at 8.

113
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:09,326
A soap-opera roof party?!

114
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:13,008
I'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

115
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,564
And it's out of my system.

116
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:28,331
And then my wife and I went
on a cruise to the Galapagos.

117
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:32,532
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.

118
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:37,603
There were clams and mussels
and oysters...

119
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,968
...and cracked crab...

120
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,203
...and snow crab...

121
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,762
...and king crab.

122
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:47,925
It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.

123
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:52,251
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?

124
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:56,008
-And that's not all I'm allergic to.
-Oh, it's not over.

125
00:07:56,173 --> 00:08:00,132
I'm also allergic to peanuts
and cashews...

126
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,363
...and almonds and filberts--

127
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,125
So basically all nuts!

128
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:06,449
Interestingly, no.

129
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,928
You're kind of playing it fast and loose
with the word "interesting."

130
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:16,088
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to use the restroom.

131
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:18,811
Oh, my God!

132
00:08:18,973 --> 00:08:21,043
I've lost the will to live.

133
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:24,126
-Let's ditch him.
-What?

134
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,887
While he's still in the bathroom.
I am begging you.

135
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:30,682
Okay. Okay, fine,
but I just have one question for you.

136
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:33,811
When we exit, should we walk or run...

137
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:36,248
...or prance or stroll--?

138
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:41,043
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,
but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!

139
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:52,523
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.

140
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,492
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.

141
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:58,690
-Hi.
-Charlie will be joining my department.

142
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:00,923
-You're a paleontologist too?
-Yeah.

143
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,209
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...

144
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:07,525
...of Renyard's new theory of species
variegation in segmented arthropods?

145
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:13,884
Well, I think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.

146
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:17,326
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.
Excuse me.

147
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:20,081
Renyard's theory of species variegation?

148
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:25,202
I saw the article on your coffee table.
I memorized the title to freak you out.

149
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:28,885
So did you two have fun?

150
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,408
Oh, my God. She's great.

151
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:35,691
We have so much in common, and she's
just cool, you know? And funny.

152
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,402
And I don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!

153
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,722
Hi!

154
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:50,242
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
I'm not feeling really well...

155
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:53,689
...and I don't think I'm gonna get
to go to the play.

156
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:55,127
Really? What's wrong?

157
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:57,409
I don't know.
I think it's kind of serious.

158
00:09:57,573 --> 00:10:00,883
You know, I was watching this thing
on TV this morning...

159
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:05,126
...about Newcastle disease,
and I think I might have it.

160
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:07,882
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...

161
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,692
...that only affects chickens
and other poultry.

162
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,445
Okay, who's this?

163
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:18,170
I'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.

164
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,164
Hi. Well, I would shake your hand...

165
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,484
...but I'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.

166
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:27,085
-Rachel, can I see you for a second?
-Sure.

167
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,287
You're not sick.

168
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:35,331
What? Yes, I am!

169
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:37,848
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?

170
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:43,647
When you're sick, you do whatever
you can to make yourself feel better.

171
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:48,324
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.

172
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:51,166
No, I heard you before.
That is so not what this is.

173
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,483
Okay, then what is this?

174
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,122
Okay.

175
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:59,210
Joey is having a secret
Days of Our Lives party up on the roof.

176
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:01,807
And he sent you guys to the play
to get rid of you.

177
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:03,885
What?!

178
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:05,887
What? What's going on?

179
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:09,523
Joey is having a secret
Days of Our Lives party up on the roof !

180
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:13,925
He didn't want you to know about it,
but I came over here to tell you.

181
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:17,883
-You came to say you were sick.
-All right, professor or detective?

182
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:22,403
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?

183
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:26,009
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.

184
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:30,212
That's why he sent us to that medieval
restaurant and to that button factory.

185
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:32,523
And that horrible museum tour?

186
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:34,571
No, I arranged that.

187
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,085
Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.
Have fun.

188
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,011
We know about your party, Joey.

189
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,529
-What party?
-The game's over. Take off your robe.

190
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:52,371
Okay, I mean....

191
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:58,044
Close it up! Close it up!

192
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,247
Nice to meet you.

193
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,244
Hey, you made it! All right!

194
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,529
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.

195
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:17,726
-Oh, my God. K yle Lowder!
-Hi.

196
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,045
I love you!

197
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:23,728
That's why I didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?

198
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,804
Just get yourself a drink
or something.

199
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:28,726
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.

200
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:32,412
Oh, my God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?

201
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:34,052
I can barely control myself.

202
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,727
You might want to remember
that you're married.

203
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:39,043
Where is Chandler anyway?

204
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:40,726
Oh, my God! Chandler!

205
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:49,692
Where the hell is everybody?

206
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,333
Why Don't You Like Me?

207
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:01,250
Chapter 1: My First Period.

208
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:07,644
Hey, Joey said no autographs.

209
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:09,849
But if she's getting one,
I want one too!

210
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:13,972
"To Monica." And none of this
"best wishes" crap. I want "love."

211
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,971
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.

212
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,806
Oh, man! If I had known
I was coming to this party...

213
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:23,770
...I never would've gotten married!

214
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:26,884
-It was nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

215
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:29,044
-Call me.
-We will!

216
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:35,130
Look at you with all the guys!
I guess you've forgotten all about Joey.

217
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,966
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten
about Joey.

218
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,408
And clearly, you've forgotten
about Chandler.

219
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:43,409
Please. Chandler's
the love of my life.

220
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,564
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!

221
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,241
So it's probably gonna be hard
for you to leave Boston, huh?

222
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:56,122
Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving.
I just broke up with someone.

223
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,443
Oh, so sad.

224
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:01,567
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.

225
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:05,646
Especially after working with a Nobel
Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.

226
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,726
Actually, Albie is the guy
I broke up with.

227
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:11,885
-You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
-Yeah.

228
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:14,851
And you called him "Albie"?

229
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:19,692
I mean, that's like calling
Albert Einstein....

230
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:21,442
Albie.

231
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:25,329
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

232
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,563
You think?
I mean, you dated the guy...

233
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,043
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!

234
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:35,365
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...

235
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,125
...he had a lot of issues.

236
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,090
Oh, like what?

237
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:42,490
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.
It's just that this must be...

238
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:46,646
...what regular people experience
when they watch Access Hollywood.

239
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,765
Okay, you want the dirt?

240
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,969
Albie was seriously insecure.

241
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:54,205
He was really intimidated by the guy
I dated before him.

242
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:57,649
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?

243
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,724
A guy who won two.

244
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:01,481
Two? What--?

245
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:04,486
Don't tell me you dated
Benjamin Hobart?

246
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,450
Yeah, for three years.

247
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:07,932
Oh, my God.

248
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:12,891
Have you ever dated someone
who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?

249
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,891
No.

250
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:18,689
But there was
my first boyfriend, Billy.

251
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:21,083
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?

252
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,404
No, but he did just win
a MacArthur "genius grant."

253
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:27,282
What a loser.

254
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:30,610
Some more wine?

255
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,922
Hey, Ross. How's it going
with Charlie?

256
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:38,890
Oh, great. After I finish my wine...

257
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:42,807
...l'm gonna blow
my average-sized brains out.

258
00:15:43,253 --> 00:15:44,481
What's the matter?

259
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:49,090
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.

260
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:51,926
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earlier today...

261
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:56,245
...I put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.

262
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,564
I always loved that.

263
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:02,089
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!

264
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:06,087
I can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.

265
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:08,687
They're so out of my league.

266
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,242
Oh, my God!

267
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:12,290
-Worse?
-Oh, much, much worse.

268
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:16,446
I did my impression of Joan Rivers
as one of the earliest amphibians.

269
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:17,682
"Can we walk?"

270
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,008
-Oh, you like that?
-No.

271
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:23,367
What?

272
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,730
Come on! I think that's funny!

273
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:28,931
Woolly mammoth.

274
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:30,731
It's good!

275
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:36,766
I bet you're thinking that now would be
a great time for an intermission, huh?

276
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,447
Oh, yes. God, yes.

277
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:41,844
Well, you're not gonna get one!

278
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:45,289
Because in life, there are
no intermissions, people!

279
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:50,122
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!

280
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:54,248
How could he leave me?!

281
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,493
I don't know. You seem lovely.

282
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:09,246
Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.

283
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,722
-Nice to meet you.
-So, what show are you on?

284
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:15,124
I'm not an actor.
I'm a professor of paleontology.

285
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,605
That's science.

286
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:20,772
Hey, well, listen,
I play a scientist on Days.

287
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,686
Yeah, my character just won
a Nobel Prize.

288
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:30,243
Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you two are together?

289
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:32,568
Well, no, but....

290
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:36,487
I mean, she only goes out
with really, really smart guys.

291
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:39,645
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.

292
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,806
I'd lead with that.

293
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,686
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.

294
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,522
Monica!

295
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:53,085
Don't worry, Joe.
I won't come next year!

296
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,167
What the--?

297
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,561
What do you got there?

298
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,122
Just some boys gave me
their phone numbers.

299
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:04,443
Oh, really? Let me see.

300
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:07,522
Damn, that's a lot of guys.

301
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,888
Are you a little slutty?

302
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,689
I think I am.

303
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:16,766
Let me see if I approve
of any of these clowns.

304
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:19,083
-This guy wears a rug.
-Well....

305
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:21,562
This guy's Canadian.

306
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,521
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?

307
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:29,244
It'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and I don't feel any different.

308
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:32,764
Pass. Pa-- Oh, pass. Pass.

309
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:36,005
-Why? What's wrong with these guys?
-Well, nothing major.

310
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:39,449
It's just that, you know,
they're not really good enough for you...

311
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,729
...and you deserve the best.

312
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,048
Joey, you're so sweet.

313
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:48,411
It's true, but it doesn't matter. I already
know who you're going home with.

314
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:50,211
Who?

315
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:54,887
Me.

316
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,606
What?

317
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:58,845
Really?

318
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:02,210
Yeah, because we live together.
It's a joke! It's a joke.

319
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:04,568
Right! That's funny! I get it!

320
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,531
-Got you!
-You're funny, Joey.

321
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,685
Oh, my God.

322
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:18,132
So how did you enjoy the play?

323
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:23,289
Oh, my God.
Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.

324
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,442
You should be.

325
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:28,652
You missed the most powerful
three hours in the history of the theater.

326
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:31,850
-You really liked it?
-Oh, yeah. I mean, at first I hated it.

327
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:36,052
But why wouldn't I? Because as a man,
I've been trained not to listen!

328
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:43,842
But after Chapter 16:
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...

329
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:46,729
...I was uplifted.

330
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:48,808
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yeah.

331
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:52,090
I had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.

332
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:56,042
Tell me--
Tell me about your first period.

333
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:58,927
No!

334
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,171
Did somebody sign your bra?

335
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,167
So I got it when I was 13.
Very difficult.

336
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:11,804
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?

337
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:15,488
Are you really just gonna let
a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?

338
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,883
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?

339
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:20,044
It's actually a million-dollar prize.

340
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:22,290
Go, Charlie!

341
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:25,088
But my point is...

342
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:29,007
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.

343
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:34,531
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.

344
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:40,250
Yeah, maybe, and I do have
my whole career in front of me.

345
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,812
I mean....

346
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:44,771
I could still win a Nobel Prize.

347
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:50,530
Although the last two papers
I've written were widely discredited.

348
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:57,128
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.

349
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:58,732
And sexy.

350
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:01,890
Okay, well, give her a chance
to see all that.

351
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,124
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

352
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:06,727
-Thanks. I'm gonna go find her.
-Good for you.

353
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:11,603
Your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.

354
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,684
Stop going through my stuff !

355
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:20,732
I just wanted to let you know
I've changed my mind.

356
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:22,849
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna kiss Joey.

357
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:26,323
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

358
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,449
Please! What about you and Chandler?

359
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:31,446
That's different.
I was drunk and stupid.

360
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:33,843
Well, hello?

361
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:38,043
What about all the guys that you got
the phone numbers from?

362
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,681
-Why don't you just kiss one of them.
-I could...

363
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:44,243
...but I don't want to.
I want to kiss Joey.

364
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:48,727
All right. I think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.

365
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:54,772
I'm gonna do it.

366
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,327
-And I can't stop you?
-No.

367
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:13,010
Hey, Rach, have you seen
Charlie anywhere?

368
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:20,808
I'm smarter than him!

369
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:29,446
Hey, thank you so much
for these tickets, Chandler.

370
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:33,811
This was a really important experience
for me. I wanted to share it with you.

371
00:22:33,973 --> 00:22:35,691
You're so wonderful.

372
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:38,964
Why Don't You Like Me?

373
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:43,649
Chapter 1: My First Period.

374
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,929
I can't believe you guys bought that.
Enjoy your slow death.

375
