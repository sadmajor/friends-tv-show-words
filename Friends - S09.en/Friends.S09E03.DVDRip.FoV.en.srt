1
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:09,211
So, what's the big news you had us
rush all the way over here for?

2
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:13,286
Our news. My company has asked me
to head up our office in Tulsa.

3
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:15,762
So as of Monday,
I'm being officially relocated.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,571
-Oh, my God!
-What? Monday?

5
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:21,009
-How long do you have to go for?
-They said it could be up to a year.

6
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:23,403
-A year?
-Well, do you have to go?

7
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:27,889
Well, I kind of have to, don't I?

8
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:30,851
Because of this stupid thing.

9
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:37,049
There's nothing like the support
of your loving wife, huh?

10
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:39,443
Wait a minute.
Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.

11
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:43,401
Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets
to the Jets game next week!

12
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:46,212
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'll be able to make it.

13
00:00:46,653 --> 00:00:49,451
But we were gonna go see the Jets!

14
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:55,372
You can't go. I mean, you're the glue
that holds this group together.

15
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:58,168
-Really?
-Not you.

16
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:03,568
I can't believe you guys are moving.

17
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:08,323
-I call their apartment!
-No!

18
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:12,529
The One With the Pediatrician

19
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:47,403
-Here you go, Rach.
-Thank you, Joey.

20
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:50,883
You know what?
I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.

21
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:54,932
I went through this with Ben and Carol.
One coffee won't affect your milk.

22
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:58,881
Just to be sure,
I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.

23
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,688
Every time?

24
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:08,325
You don't have to call him
whenever you have a question, okay?

25
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:13,089
-Trust me. I know this.
-All right. I trust you.

26
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,888
I can see you dialing.
I don't understand why--

27
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,443
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?

28
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:24,890
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel
with a baby. It's just so grownup.

29
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:29,205
I know, yeah.
I feel like we're all growing up.

30
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:31,967
A person named "Wiener."
God, that kills me.

31
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:36,932
-Look at you all grownup.
-Well, actually, you know what?

32
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:38,806
I am, you know?

33
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:41,726
Well, that whole thing
with Rachel made me realize...

34
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:45,408
...that maybe I'm ready for a more
serious relationship, you know?

35
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:48,963
Like, I'd like to meet a nice,
mature, commitment-minded lady.

36
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:52,091
And looks aren't as important as....

37
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:53,966
Nah, she's gotta be hot.

38
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,849
You know, I might know somebody.

39
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:59,686
How about you set me up
with someone, and we double-date?

40
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:02,048
I can do that. Yeah.
How's Friday?

41
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:03,202
-Done!
-All right.

42
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,443
Good, really?
Okay, let's see.

43
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,564
All right.

44
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,447
You know who's great?
Sandy Poopack.

45
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:14,771
"Poopack"?

46
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:21,491
Yeah. All right.
Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.

47
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:29,766
-I've got good news.
-You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?

48
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,322
Okay, I have news.

49
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:36,243
You don't have to move to Tulsa.
You can stay here and keep your job.

50
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:37,732
That's great! How?

51
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:41,249
My boss and I worked out a deal
where I'm in Tulsa four days a week.

52
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:43,449
So the other three,
I can be here with you.

53
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:47,130
So you're gonna be gone
four days a week?

54
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:49,082
No.

55
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:52,404
I'm sorry, are you just
used to saying that?

56
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,645
No. I can't be away
from you for that long.

57
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,930
-Really?
-Yeah, you're my husband.

58
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:04,211
I won't live in a different state
than you for 208 days out of the year.

59
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:09,289
That's fast math.
We could use you in Tulsa.

60
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:15,887
Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
but if you go to Tulsa, I go with you.

61
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:18,204
You said that without gagging.

62
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:21,043
I know!

63
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,211
Well, excuse me?

64
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:29,082
Oh, yeah?
Well, up yours too!

65
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:33,010
-Who the hell was that?
-Dr. Wiener.

66
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:38,329
Rach, you can't call people
at 3:00 in the morning.

67
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:41,610
You know what?
You sound just like his wife.

68
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:44,004
Was there anything
even wrong with Emma?

69
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:48,086
Yes, of course there is!
Okay? I'm not insane.

70
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:49,768
What was it?

71
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:52,569
Hiccups.

72
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:56,772
I told you, you can't call him
every time any little thing comes up.

73
00:04:56,933 --> 00:05:00,767
Well, not anymore I can't.
He fired us!

74
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,325
What are we gonna do?
We have to find a pediatrician.

75
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:08,007
Wait, Monica said that
when you guys were growing up...

76
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,323
...you liked your doctor.
What was his name?

77
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:12,564
Dr. Gettleman?

78
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,293
Yeah, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

79
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,683
In fact, I think he's dead.

80
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:19,844
Why does everything happen to me?

81
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:24,165
I promise, first thing tomorrow,
we'll find another doctor.

82
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,767
But I gotta get up early,
and I'm not feeling well.

83
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:29,731
You're not feeling well?
What do you have? Rubella?

84
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:32,930
Because don't go near Emma,
she has not had that shot.

85
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:36,888
You know, come to think of it,
it does feel rubella-like.

86
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:49,132
Wiener!

87
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:51,249
Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

88
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:52,402
Rachel!

89
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:55,646
Great! Now he's gonna
know it was me!

90
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:05,811
So how is this
for our big double date tonight?

91
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,245
Oh, my God.

92
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,764
Great. Just the reaction
I was hoping for.

93
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:16,448
Yeah, so you found someone for me?
You didn't forget?

94
00:06:16,613 --> 00:06:18,968
Of course not.
And you'll love Mary Ellen.

95
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:22,569
She's really smart and cute
and funny and....

96
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:27,853
I can't tell you how I know this,
but she is not opposed to threesomes.

97
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:30,002
All right.

98
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:34,645
-So tell me something about my guy.
-No.

99
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:39,011
Come on, give me something.
What's his name?

100
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,691
-Mike.
-Mike. Okay, what's his last name?

101
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:46,971
Damn it! Is there no mystery left
in romance anymore?!

102
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:50,205
We'll see you and Mike
at the restaurant in a couple hours.

103
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:54,161
All right, great.
See you. Bye-bye.

104
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:58,849
Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't know
a Mike! Why couldn't I have said...?

105
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:03,651
There's no guys in there!

106
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:09,362
It's impossible to find a good doctor.
How do you know the good ones...

107
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:13,003
...from the ones who'll push
their penis against your knee?

108
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,368
Excuse me?

109
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:17,649
I know what she's talking about.

110
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:24,970
Well, we've gotta find
a new pediatrician.

111
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:28,045
Ross was getting sick last night,
and Emma may have caught it.

112
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:31,011
-Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?
-Ross said he died.

113
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:34,131
He didn't die.
I just saw his daughter last week.

114
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:39,492
She said he was fine.
Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.

115
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:42,247
Great. Well then, I'm gonna
take Emma to see him.

116
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:44,131
I wonder why Ross said that he died?

117
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:47,046
Maybe he confused him
with his childhood therapist.

118
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:48,282
He saw a therapist?

119
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:51,286
He used to have a recurring nightmare.
It freaked him out.

120
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:53,444
Wow, what was it?

121
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:55,251
That I was going to eat him.

122
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:10,884
Mike!

123
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,805
Yeah?

124
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:18,404
Okay.

125
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:24,368
I can't believe
I'm doing this with you.

126
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,888
Although I did just end
a nine-year relationship...

127
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:29,044
...so I should be open
to taking some risks.

128
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:30,885
It'll be fine.
Follow my lead, okay?

129
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,964
All you have to do is
pretend to be Mike.

130
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,044
-I am Mike.
-Attaboy.

131
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:39,486
Here they come.

132
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,763
-I'm Phoebe.
-Phoebe. Mike. How you doing?

133
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,811
-Nice to meet you.
-Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.

134
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:48,283
So, Mike, how do you and Joey
know each other, anyway?

135
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:53,722
How do Joey and I know each other?

136
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:57,852
If I had a nickel for every time
somebody's asked me that.

137
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:00,848
-From school.
-We met in college.

138
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:05,842
I mean high school.

139
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:11,171
You guys go way back, then.
So, what are you up to these days?

140
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,372
-Well, I'm a lawyer.
-Mike, attorney at law!

141
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:18,042
-Actually, I just gave up my practice.
-What?

142
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:22,047
That's the kind of thing
you usually run by me.

143
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:26,685
I want to play piano professionally.
If I don't do this now, I never will.

144
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:29,162
Great. I like that better
than the lawyer thing.

145
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,087
Which is why I waited until now
to introduce you to Mike.

146
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:35,164
You thought he was still a lawyer.

147
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,405
No, that's not what I meant.
Let's get you a cocktail.

148
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:43,928
What are you doing?

149
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,653
Looking for restaurant jobs
for you in Tulsa.

150
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,804
That's so sweet.
Did you find anything?

151
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,567
-Slim Pickins.
-Nothing, huh?

152
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:55,567
No. Slim Pickins.
It's a barbecue joint.

153
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:59,248
They're looking for a cook. Actually,
"cook" may be a bit of a stretch.

154
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,847
They're looking for somebody
to shovel mesquite.

155
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:05,562
"Slim Pickins"? That is so cheesy.

156
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,452
Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.

157
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:11,326
Honey, that's okay.
I know this woman, Nancy...

158
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:14,371
...who's a restaurant biz headhunter.
She may know something.

159
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:17,093
Can I say how much I appreciate
you coming with me?

160
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:21,963
When we get to Tulsa, I am taking you
for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.

161
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:23,522
So Cheesy?

162
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,563
Whole Hog?

163
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,928
It's gonna be tough
to keep kosher in Tulsa.

164
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:38,606
Hi, Nancy?
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

165
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:44,052
I'm good. Listen, I'm looking
for a job in Tulsa.

166
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:47,803
Yeah, well, my husband's
been relocated.

167
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,407
Because I love him.

168
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:53,122
No, I don't want a job in New York.

169
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:56,365
Javu's looking? Oh, my God!

170
00:10:56,533 --> 00:11:00,367
He asked for me personally?
Oh, my God!

171
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:03,843
Wow, this is really,
really flattering.

172
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,732
But I'm moving to Tulsa.

173
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,407
So, just, if you would tell Javu...

174
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:11,848
...l'll take it!

175
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:16,050
My name's Rachel Greene.
I have an appointment for Emma.

176
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:20,001
Dr. Gettleman is finishing up
with a patient. He'll be out shortly.

177
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:23,643
I think you just have a cold.
It's definitely not strep.

178
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,087
Thanks, doctor.

179
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,886
-Would you like a lollipop?
-Do you even have to ask?

180
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,689
He is alive!

181
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:46,842
It's so surprising that you and Joey
have known each other for so long...

182
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:48,605
...and I've never heard about you.

183
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:52,971
That's because we had
a bit of a falling out.

184
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,011
Mike hit my mom with a car.

185
00:11:58,373 --> 00:12:02,161
-No, I didn't.
-That's okay. I have forgiven you.

186
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,528
Now we're friends again,
and everything's great.

187
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:06,365
Well, wait. Is your mom okay?

188
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:10,242
Please, we're trying
to have a conversation.

189
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,449
You're a lot nicer
on Days of Our Lives.

190
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:16,081
Days of Our Lives!
That's why you look so familiar!

191
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:17,322
-What?
-What?

192
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:19,529
What?

193
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,692
Do you not know each other?

194
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:29,206
Of course we do. He's playing a game
we used to play in high school.

195
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,570
We pretend we don't know each other.
We played all kinds of games.

196
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:37,011
You remember that one where I punch
you in the face for not being cool?

197
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:42,208
Let me ask you something:
How many sisters does Joey have?

198
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:46,366
-Six.
-What are you doing? I said seven!

199
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:52,004
Joey, why did you set me up
with a stranger?

200
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:56,007
Because I forgot about our date.
I'm so sorry.

201
00:12:56,173 --> 00:13:00,371
I'm sorry too. And just to be clear,
I didn't hit his mother with a car.

202
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:05,489
You are unbelievable. I spent so much
time finding the perfect girl for you.

203
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:08,531
Mary Ellen is really smart
and cute and loose.

204
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,207
Who are you kidding?

205
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:20,211
You find some guy
off the street for me?

206
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:22,329
God, this is humiliating!

207
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:26,452
I'm so sorry. If you don't like this guy,
I can find you a better one.

208
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:29,252
Mike? Mike?

209
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,362
I'm out of here.

210
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,610
It was nice meeting you.

211
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:36,970
-You're leaving too?
-I'll stay if you can tell me my name.

212
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,282
Have a good night.

213
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:45,092
We leave tomorrow,
and you still have a lot to pack.

214
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:46,368
You're right.

215
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:48,925
Maybe I shouldn't go.

216
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:51,964
What?

217
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:56,651
So Nancy told me about this job
at this great restaurant, Javu?

218
00:13:56,813 --> 00:13:58,963
But it's just
a little outside of Tulsa.

219
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,407
Well, how far outside?

220
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:02,686
Manhattan?

221
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,691
And you're thinking of taking it?

222
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:12,809
Before, you said that being with me
was more important than any job.

223
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:17,683
But I guess now it's
old job, me, new job.

224
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,043
I'm gonna miss this hand!

225
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:24,651
I know this is a lot to ask...

226
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:27,725
...but, my God, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

227
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:30,771
What happened to "you can't live
without me four days a week"?

228
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:35,882
Well, if you really think about it,
I mean, four days is not that long.

229
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,771
I see you Monday
before you go to work...

230
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,571
...and Thursday when you get back...

231
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:43,328
...and I always work late on Tuesdays,
so really if you think about it...

232
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:44,846
...it's really just one day.

233
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:49,803
And well, if we can't make it one day,
we got real problems, my friend.

234
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:56,810
-I think you should take the job.
-Really?

235
00:14:56,973 --> 00:15:00,886
I know it must be important to you
when you start chattering like a monkey.

236
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:05,931
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

237
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,405
-How was the pediatrician?
-I really liked him.

238
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:18,044
Yeah, yeah.
It was really, really, really good.

239
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,689
-You promised not to say anything.
-I know.

240
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,970
Ross still sees his pediatrician!

241
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,609
I don't care.

242
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:32,610
Are you serious?
You still see Dr. Gettleman?

243
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:34,650
He is a brilliant diagnostician!

244
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:38,408
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

245
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:41,726
Seriously, you gotta go
to an appropriate doctor.

246
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:45,886
Why? I know it's a little weird,
but he is a great doctor, okay?

247
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,725
He knows my medical history.

248
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:50,646
And every time I go in there,
he makes a big deal.

249
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:53,247
You know,
"Look, it's my favorite patient."

250
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:57,008
Does he say that before he sticks
his thermometer in your tushy?

251
00:15:57,173 --> 00:16:01,564
I seem to remember someone bringing
his security blanket to college.

252
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:04,531
That was not a security blanket.
That was a wall hanging.

253
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,684
It didn't spend much time on the wall!

254
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:18,210
Excuse me.

255
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,243
Hi. I was hoping to run into you.
Can we talk?

256
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:23,642
Sure.

257
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:27,328
I'm sorry, really.
I'm so embarrassed...

258
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:29,449
...that our....

259
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:35,610
Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my parole officer.

260
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:41,729
Apparently, I'm not a funny guy.

261
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:46,644
Well, why did you go along with that?

262
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:51,841
Because I was told that I'd get
a free dinner, which I didn't.

263
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:55,085
And that I'd meet a pretty girl,
which I did.

264
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,409
That's true.

265
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:04,881
Well, is anything you told me
about yourself true?

266
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:07,931
My name is Mike.
And I do play piano.

267
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:11,722
-Prove it.
-There isn't a piano here.

268
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:15,329
That wouldn't stand in the way
of a true pianist.

269
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:17,372
Okay.

270
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:34,686
You are really good.

271
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:42,283
-I play a little guitar myself.
-Really? That's great.

272
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:45,968
-What kind of music do you play?
-Like acoustic, folksy stuff, you know?

273
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:50,763
But right now I'm working on
a couple Iron Maiden covers.

274
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:57,686
Do you think that, maybe,
sometime, I could....

275
00:17:57,853 --> 00:18:00,208
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

276
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:05,128
Okay. You think, maybe,
sometime I could take you out?

277
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:07,889
You just caught me off guard.

278
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:10,691
Yeah, that would be nice.

279
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:13,407
Look at this! My two best friends!

280
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,206
Excuse me.
I don't mean to be a jerk...

281
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:24,763
...but the baby with the rash
came in after me.

282
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:28,565
The doctor will be right with you, sir.

283
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:33,924
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.

284
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:36,607
What, the circus?
He's behind the elephant.

285
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:40,368
Wow. So your child's a big fan
of the Waldo books too?

286
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:45,525
Yeah, that's how I know.

287
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:49,091
-I'm Ross, by the way.
-Hi, I'm Sally.

288
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,882
So no ring. Can I assume
you're also a single parent?

289
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:56,682
-I am a single parent.
-lt's hard, isn't it?

290
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:00,209
There's no time for a social life.
Where are you gonna meet someone?

291
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:06,687
Let's say, I don't know, you met
someone in the pediatrician's office.

292
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:10,123
Rossie? We're ready for you.

293
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:19,726
Yeah....

294
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,572
Come on, Ross Jr.
It's time to go in.

295
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:28,764
Mommy.

296
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,569
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?

297
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:37,008
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!

298
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:47,165
-Good, you haven't left yet.
-Where have you been?

299
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,609
I got held up
at Dr. Gettleman's office.

300
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:55,289
There was some guy
that freaked everybody out.

301
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:58,047
You got here just in time.
I really have to go, buddy.

302
00:19:58,213 --> 00:19:59,202
Oh, man.

303
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:03,048
-Promise to call me when you land?
-Of course I will. I love you.

304
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:04,328
I love you too.

305
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:13,007
Watch the tongue, people.
We got a baby over here.

306
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:16,212
-Bye, Chandler.
-Bye.

307
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,603
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.

308
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:26,528
-What's the matter, Joe?
-I'm mad at you for leaving.

309
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:30,322
You know, you're nothing
but a big leaver.

310
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:33,889
A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

311
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:40,329
Any chance you're trying to pick
a fight to make all of this easier?

312
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:46,090
Dude, you see right through me!

313
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:56,922
Okay, well.... Bye, Mon.

314
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:59,529
Bye, Ross. Rachel.

315
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,130
-Bye, Emma.
-Okay, bye-bye.

316
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:06,365
Have a good trip. Okay.
Oh, my God.

317
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,085
Wait.

318
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:16,286
It goes old job...

319
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:18,444
...new job...

320
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:19,762
...and you.

321
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,769
This is just something I have to do.

322
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:26,284
I know.

323
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,683
I love you so much.

324
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:31,367
I know that too.

325
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:45,088
Don't worry.
I'll be back before you know it.

326
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:46,925
Yes, it will be the same.

327
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:50,161
Because I know, that's how.

328
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,368
I promise.

329
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:52,807
You double promise?

330
00:21:57,253 --> 00:21:58,811
Call me when you land.

331
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,608
-Can I talk now?
-Okay, bye.

332
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:04,570
-Joey!
-He had to board.

333
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:10,482
