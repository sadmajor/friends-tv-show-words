1
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:08,128
Hey, hon? Would you help me
get the plates down?

2
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:11,285
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't
we use our wedding china today?

3
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:14,490
No, I think we should save our china
for something really special.

4
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,883
Like if the queen of England
comes over.

5
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:20,331
Honey, she keeps
canceling on us. Take the hint.

6
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,404
What if something breaks?
They're expensive.

7
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:26,525
What is the point of having them
if we never use them?

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,526
Okay. But if something breaks
and then the queen comes over....

9
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:33,203
-I will explain it to her.
-Like I'd let you talk to the queen.

10
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:37,971
The parade is really good this year.

11
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,806
Man, those horses can crap.

12
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:43,842
Next up is a marching band
from Muskogee, Oklahoma.

13
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:47,005
Muskogee?
That's like four hours from Tulsa!

14
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:51,891
Here's the float with the stars
of the popular daytime soap...

15
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,129
...Days of our Lives.

16
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:59,283
Oh, my God!

17
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:03,162
Aren't you one of the stars of the
popular daytime soap Days of our Lives?

18
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:06,206
I forgot! I'm supposed to be there!

19
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:11,048
I can't believe I forgot! I usually write
stuff like this down on my arm!

20
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:16,367
Stupid long sleeves!

21
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:20,446
-What are you gonna do?
-I'll come up with a good reason...

22
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,126
...why I wasn't there.

23
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:24,966
The producers are gonna be mad.
They sat us down and said:

24
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:29,968
"Everyone has to be there, 6 a.m. sharp.
That means you, Tribbiani."

25
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,852
Like I was some kind of idiot.

26
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,723
Well, you proved them wrong.

27
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,203
The One With Rachel's Other Sister

28
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,043
Oh, Emma.

29
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,125
This is your first Thanksgiving.

30
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:31,568
What are you thankful for?

31
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,689
Mommy's boobies?

32
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,047
A lot of people are thankful for those.

33
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:41,204
Hello? Rachel?

34
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:42,482
Who is it?

35
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:45,611
It's your favorite sister.

36
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:48,048
-Jill?
-Amy!

37
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:50,050
Hide my rings.

38
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:57,845
Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.

39
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:04,449
Do you have a hair straightener?

40
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:07,569
Hi.

41
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:09,121
-Hi.
-Hi.

42
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:11,568
Hair straightener.

43
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,931
-I haven't seen you in, like, a year.
-I know. I know. I've just been crazed.

44
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:19,205
Well, me too.
I had a baby.

45
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:22,646
I decorated Dad's office.

46
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:28,046
Yeah? Well, unless you pushed a desk
out of your vagina, not the same thing.

47
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:31,567
About that hair straightener,
honey, I really need one.

48
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,406
I'm gonna have dinner
at my boyfriend's house.

49
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:37,364
Oh, my God.

50
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,808
Is this Emmett?

51
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,449
It's Emma.

52
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:47,006
It's a girl?

53
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,367
-Hey, Amy.
-Amy, you remember Ross?

54
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,290
Not really.

55
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:58,002
But you are much cuter
than that geeky guy she used to date.

56
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,650
That was me.

57
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:07,012
No, he was this creepy guy from high
school who had this huge crush on her...

58
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,965
...since, like, the ninth grade.

59
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:10,486
Still me.

60
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,885
No, I'm not talking about you.

61
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,772
It was your fat friend's brother
with that bad Afro.

62
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:19,807
Okay, Amy, I'm gonna save you
some time, okay? All me!

63
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:27,685
Careful. Careful.

64
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:29,770
Careful!

65
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,363
I'll tell you what.
For the rest of our lives...

66
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,842
...l'll be careful until told otherwise.

67
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:39,322
-This isn't the china we picked out.
-I know.

68
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:42,724
After you left the store,
I chose different ones.

69
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,167
-Why?
-Your taste is a little feminine for me.

70
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:49,807
Suddenly flowers are feminine?

71
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:53,691
Hey, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!

72
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,123
-Happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs!
-What's going on, Joe?

73
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,443
Listen, I need a good lie.

74
00:04:58,613 --> 00:04:59,932
Okay.

75
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:04,047
How about the whole "man walking
on the moon" thing, you know?

76
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:07,924
You can see the strings, people!

77
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,808
No, no, no. I need a good lie to explain
why I wasn't at a work thing today.

78
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:14,642
-Honey, you stink at lying.
-I do not.

79
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:18,050
Really? Let me ask you something.
Yesterday at the coffeehouse...

80
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:21,728
...I went to the bathroom. When I came
back, my muffin was gone. Who took it?

81
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,249
Somebody opened the door
to the coffeehouse...

82
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:29,201
...and a raccoon ran in and went
straight for your muffin. I said:

83
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:32,524
"Hey, don't eat that!
That's Phoebe's!" And he said....

84
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:38,322
He said, "Joey, you stink at lying."
What am I gonna do?

85
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:41,087
Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.
I'll help you.

86
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:45,081
-Great. That'd be great. Thank you.
-Sure. What was the work thing?

87
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:49,491
-"Pick up Grandma at the airport."
-Oh, man!

88
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:54,808
She's precious.

89
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:58,888
Do you ever worry
that she's gonna get your real nose?

90
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:00,884
Amy....

91
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:04,248
Yes, I do. I really do.

92
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,006
Hello?

93
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:13,563
Yeah, hang on, one sec.
Can I take this upstairs?

94
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,883
Sure. We don't live there, but....

95
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:20,641
Seriously? It's just these rooms?

96
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,008
-I thought you were a doctor.
-Yeah. No, Ross has a Ph.D.

97
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:33,730
God, she is unbelievable.

98
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,891
I know. I mean, a Ph.D.
is just as good as an MD.

99
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:38,765
Sure, Ross, yeah!

100
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:43,165
If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,
I want you there with your fossil brush.

101
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:47,044
-Stupid Thanksgiving.
-What?

102
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:50,250
-What? What happened?
-My boyfriend canceled on me.

103
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,802
I mean, I finally find a real relationship.

104
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:57,728
Someone that I can spend this day with,
and then his wife comes back into town!

105
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:01,010
I swear, it's almost not even
worth dating married guys.

106
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,125
Don't say that.

107
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,848
God, I was so looking forward to this.

108
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:09,925
It was gonna be such
a beautiful Thanksgiving.

109
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,402
We were gonna have sushi.

110
00:07:13,573 --> 00:07:16,133
Amy, don't cry.

111
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:20,802
-Ross, can I talk to you in private?
-Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or...?

112
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,371
Look, I was thinking,
if it's okay with Monica...

113
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:31,001
...I would like to invite Amy
to Thanksgiving.

114
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:37,010
I think that's a great idea. It'll be like
the Pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.

115
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:41,091
Look, I know she's a little tough to take.

116
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:45,405
But she has nowhere else to go,
and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.

117
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:50,363
-And I would like them to bond.
-I don't want them bonding too much.

118
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,967
I don't want her telling Emma
she needs a nose job.

119
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,961
Ross, she may need one. We're just
gonna have to make our peace with that!

120
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:05,771
-Hi!
-Hey.

121
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:09,005
Hey, you guys. This is my sister, Amy.

122
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:13,086
This is Chandler, Joey,
Phoebe, and you know Mon.

123
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,726
Oh, my God.

124
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,009
You're on Days of our Lives!

125
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:18,492
Yeah.

126
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:21,929
Wow! They must put
a lot of makeup on you.

127
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,243
Happy Thanksgiving.

128
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,005
-Hey.
-Hi.

129
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:34,165
So welcome. Is this the first time
you're seeing Emma?

130
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:37,365
Yeah, I think so.
It's nice to meet you, Emma.

131
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:42,690
-Phoebe.
-That's a funny noise.

132
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:49,928
-Pheebs? I still need some help here.
-Right. Okay.

133
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:54,325
So it's not just the lie you tell,
but it's the way you tell it. For example...

134
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,690
...if you look at the ground when
you talk, people know you're lying.

135
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:02,372
I don't know why this is so hard for me.
Lying is basically just acting...

136
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:05,809
-...and I am a terrific actor.
-You are a terrific actor.

137
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:12,287
-Hey. Where's the baby?
-We just put her down for a nap.

138
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:16,002
Listen, I was just thinking.
You know what would be incredible?

139
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,807
If you guys died!

140
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,169
Thank you, Amy.

141
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:25,092
No, no, then I would get the baby.

142
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:29,405
It would be just like a movie. At first
I wouldn't know what to do with her.

143
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:33,532
And then I would rise to the occasion.
Then I'd get a makeover and get married.

144
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,963
That's a great movie!

145
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,411
Yeah. Listen, not that you guys
could stop me or anything...

146
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,888
...because you know, you'd be dead.

147
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:45,248
But I was thinking about
changing her name.

148
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:47,722
I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.

149
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:50,851
Emma.

150
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,404
Emma? Ross wants you.

151
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:57,644
Phoebe!

152
00:09:58,893 --> 00:10:01,771
Why does she keep making that noise?

153
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,443
Honey, I don't know
how to tell you this...

154
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:10,765
...but if something were to happen
to Ross or myself...

155
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:14,090
-...you wouldn't get the baby.
-Well, who would?

156
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:18,203
Well, we haven't officially
asked them yet...

157
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:20,967
...but we would want
Monica and Chandler.

158
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,328
I can't believe you'd want us
to raise Emma.

159
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:25,324
Oh, my God, I'm so moved.

160
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,093
I don't believe this. Hold on a second.
You guys die...

161
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,642
...and I don't get your baby?

162
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:34,050
Amy, see, we're a lot closer
to Monica and Chandler.

163
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:38,286
We see them every day. And truthfully,
you don't seem connected to the baby.

164
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:41,929
Connected? To what? She's a lump.

165
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:47,172
You know, guys, I've gotta say
this means so much to me.

166
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:50,524
I mean, that you would
trust me with your child.

167
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,207
I mean, we all know
that Monica and I have been...

168
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:55,603
...trying to have a baby of our own.

169
00:10:55,773 --> 00:11:00,767
You know, I've had my doubts
about my skills as a father, but....

170
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:04,204
That you two....

171
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:07,725
-That you two....
-This guy?

172
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,412
Seriously?

173
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:17,729
Okay, it's time for dinner.

174
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,487
Everyone, we're using our fancy china...

175
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:24,407
...and it's very expensive,
so please be careful.

176
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:34,522
Okay, just to be clear, comedy with
the plates will not be well-received.

177
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:43,571
Hey!

178
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:47,487
How come my plate's less fancy
than everyone else's?

179
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,041
Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?

180
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:54,205
No, honey. That's a special plate.

181
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:57,922
See, it's a game.
Whoever gets that plate wins.

182
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:02,086
I can't believe I won!

183
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,164
You know, this is such a slap
in the face. I mean, I'm your sister...

184
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,121
...and you would give your baby
to these strangers over me.

185
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,722
Monica is Ross' sister.

186
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:16,882
No, Ross' sister was really fat.

187
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:19,726
That was me.

188
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:24,691
No, she was this dorky girl in school who
followed Rachel around like a puppy--

189
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:27,128
Amy, you've got to stop doing that!

190
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:35,726
Okay, listen, I know you're having
a bit of a family crisis...

191
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:38,361
...but you don't have to take it out
on the plates.

192
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:41,252
I mean, in fact, I think that everyone...

193
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:45,167
...should cut their food like this:

194
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:50,171
Now, see? This way,
you protect the plates...

195
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:52,324
...and let's face it, you have fun.

196
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:56,686
Okay, how about this?
If you guys die...

197
00:12:56,853 --> 00:13:00,528
...and the crazy plate lady dies...

198
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,564
-...then do I get the baby?
-No, if crazy plate lady--

199
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:10,888
If Monica dies,
then I would get Emma. Right?

200
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:16,886
-Well, actually....
-Actually what?

201
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:20,324
It's just....
It's just that in that case...

202
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:22,324
...then Emma would go
to my parents.

203
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:24,849
-What?
-Hurts, doesn't it?

204
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:31,325
Who has to die for me to get her?

205
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:40,684
So if Monica's not around,
I'm not good enough to raise Emma?

206
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:43,202
No, that is not what we're saying.

207
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,051
Yeah, he's lying. He looked down.

208
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,529
Well, what's wrong with me?
Am I incompetent?

209
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:53,169
Because I managed to survive whatever
it is that killed the three of you!

210
00:13:55,813 --> 00:14:00,648
You're taking this the wrong way.
We think you'll be a wonderful parent.

211
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:04,328
It's just.... You're more
the, you know, fun parent.

212
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,532
Yeah, and we wanna make sure
Emma also has someone like Monica...

213
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:10,490
...who's more of a disciplinarian.

214
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:13,406
Someone who can be firm and strict.

215
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:16,041
That's not how you see me, is it?

216
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:19,527
No, you're all about the fun.

217
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:28,968
I may not know a lot about babies,
but do you really think I'm not capable?

218
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:31,767
No. You both are equally capable.

219
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,401
It's just you're strongest
when you're together.

220
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:38,288
Okay. So if we both had Emma,
and I died...

221
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:40,571
...she'd have to give her up.

222
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,733
Sure. Monica would have to give her up.

223
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:47,091
I lie better than that, right?

224
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:52,201
Let me just get this straight.
So my two friends die, I get Emma.

225
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:56,286
Then my wife dies. Then Emma,
the one tiny ray of hope left in my life...

226
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:59,809
-...gets taken away from me?
-There's your movie.

227
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,927
Hey, there you are.

228
00:15:06,093 --> 00:15:09,165
-You disappeared after dinner.
-Did somebody miss me?

229
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:12,171
Was there a child to raise poorly?

230
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,809
Ross and Rachel don't know
what they're saying.

231
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:16,810
It's not like they're so responsible.

232
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:21,251
Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot
and a five-year-old condom.

233
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:26,847
No, but they're right. I'm not a strong
father figure, and I never will be.

234
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,567
No, you learn these things.
You grow into it.

235
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:31,485
Yeah, but it's not who I am.

236
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:36,608
Everything they said is exactly why I was
worried about having a kid. And it's true.

237
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:39,606
-And look, everybody knows it.
-I don't know it.

238
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,209
I wanna have a kid with you because
I think you'll be an amazing dad.

239
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:45,887
At the fun parts and at the hard parts.

240
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:49,449
Well, can you picture me saying,
"Go to your room, you're grounded"?

241
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,528
Can you hear me say,
"You're grounded"?

242
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,048
You said that to me last week.

243
00:15:56,813 --> 00:16:00,169
How hard is it?
"No shoes on the furniture!"

244
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:10,412
The producer from Days left a message
asking why I wasn't at the parade.

245
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:14,606
They said everybody's really pissed off
at me. And they all got to meet Santa!

246
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,522
It's okay.
I thought of the perfect lie for you.

247
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:22,043
It's easy to remember,
and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.

248
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:25,928
You weren't at the parade
because you had a family emergency.

249
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,567
I like that! Yeah!

250
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,486
I wasn't at the parade
because I had a family emergency.

251
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:33,570
What happened?

252
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,691
-My sister's raccoon came--
-No, nothing with a raccoon!

253
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:42,412
-Wait, what are you doing?
-Setting the table.

254
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:46,248
We thought it might be nice
to use the fancy china for dessert too.

255
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:49,889
How nice. Maybe later we can all
blow our noses on my wedding dress.

256
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:59,083
Hey, dude, you okay?
Sorry about before.

257
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:03,292
That's okay. You're totally right. I don't
know anything about disciplining a child.

258
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:07,810
But it did hurt my feelings,
and I want you to know that if I die...

259
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:10,123
...you don't get Joey.

260
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,245
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm not talking to you.

261
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:30,932
You know, this is just....
This is classic Rachel.

262
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,411
Right. Remember in high school when
I died and didn't give you my baby?

263
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:40,691
This might be my one chance
to have a child, Rachel.

264
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,090
I mean, you know that I have been
so busy focusing on my career....

265
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:47,882
-What career?
-I'm a decorator.

266
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:51,324
You decorate Dad's office
and now you're a decorator?

267
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:55,964
Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday,
now I'm a koala bear.

268
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:02,322
-Why can't you ever be supportive?
-You want to talk supportive?

269
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:06,122
You didn't come and visit me when
I was in the hospital having the baby!

270
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,127
You didn't come see me in the hospital
when I was getting my lips done!

271
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,643
I did the first time.

272
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:19,043
You know what? You want to know
why I am not giving Emily to you?

273
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:21,522
-Emma.
-Whose side are you on?!

274
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:27,210
I'm not giving you Emma because you
can't handle the responsibility of a child.

275
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:30,924
Well, how hard could it be?
You do it.

276
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:38,284
You wanna know why
you don't want me to have the baby?

277
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,603
Because you don't want me to be happy.

278
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:44,243
-You have always been jealous of me.
-Jealous of what?

279
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:47,962
Of your lack of responsibility?
Your immaturity?

280
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:51,011
Your total disregard
for other people's feelings?

281
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,443
To name a few.

282
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:56,811
You've always been like this.

283
00:18:56,973 --> 00:19:00,249
You had to have everything,
and I couldn't have anything.

284
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:03,485
Like in junior high,
when you stole Timmy from me.

285
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:06,406
I mean, do you even realize
how much that hurt me?

286
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,968
Timmy was my boyfriend,
and you made out with him!

287
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:12,131
Come on, that was 20 years ago.
Get over it.

288
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:15,246
I cannot believe
that I invited you here today!

289
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:19,167
Yeah, well, you know what I cannot
believe? That my so-called sister...

290
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,963
...gets a 30% discount from Ralph
Lauren, and I still have to pay retail?

291
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,772
It's 45.

292
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:30,845
You bitch.

293
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:35,170
You just think you're so perfect...

294
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,882
...with your new baby
and your small apartment.

295
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:45,242
Well, let me tell you something.
Your baby isn't even that cute.

296
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:50,122
Too far, Amy. Too far.

297
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:54,209
-You take that back.
-No.

298
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,722
-Take it back!
-No. What are you gonna do? Make me?

299
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:59,731
Hey, man, I work out!

300
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:03,084
-So do I.
-I do Pilates.

301
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:04,931
-I do yoga.
-Bring it on!

302
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:08,206
Put the plates in the boxes!
Put the plates in the boxes!

303
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,882
-Did you just push me?
-Yeah, I think I did.

304
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:14,321
All right, that's it.

305
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:17,206
Forget the bubble wrap!
There isn't time!

306
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:21,091
Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy!

307
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:28,253
-Shouldn't we stop this?
-Are you out of your mind?

308
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:30,688
Let's throw some Jell-O on them!

309
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,725
Gross!

310
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:52,683
All right, that is it! This is our apartment,
and you cannot behave this way!

311
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:55,492
If you can't act your age,
you shouldn't be here at all.

312
00:20:55,693 --> 00:21:00,369
Those plates may not be as nice as
the pretty pink ones that I picked out...

313
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:06,082
...but they're important to Monica.
And I want you to apologize to her, now.

314
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,767
-I'm sorry.
-Mon, I'm so sorry.

315
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,764
Okay. That's better.

316
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:14,164
Now, I want you to apologize
to each other and mean it.

317
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,086
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

318
00:21:16,293 --> 00:21:19,490
By the way, that fight
was totally arousing.

319
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,364
Dude, well done.

320
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:30,408
If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,
you can totally take care of Emma.

321
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:32,811
Yeah? Well, thanks.

322
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,285
So....
So now do I get Joey?

323
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:42,723
Okay. But you should know he eats a lot
and shoves pennies up his nose.

324
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:49,723
Are you okay, Mon?

325
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:53,442
I mean, these things happen.
I mean, it's just a plate.

326
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:57,208
-It's not like somebody died.
-It's all right. You can mourn.

327
00:21:57,573 --> 00:22:01,361
Thank you. It was so beautiful!

328
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:05,563
I'm gonna go to Joey's
and get the pies.

329
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:09,368
Actually, not pies. It's just pie.

330
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:12,809
I don't care.

331
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:16,409
Oh, my God, I've lost the will to scold.

332
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:22,329
Look, Amy...

333
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,286
...we got a little...

334
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:27,172
...a little out-of-control over there.

335
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:29,252
And I'm sorry.

336
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:31,881
You're my sister...

337
00:22:32,053 --> 00:22:34,362
...and if it really means
that much to you....

338
00:22:34,693 --> 00:22:37,526
-So you're gonna give me the baby?
-No, I was....

339
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:40,651
I was gonna let you use
my Ralph Lauren discount.

340
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:44,771
You are not gonna regret this.

341
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,605
-She needs changing.
-No, no, no. I'll get her.

342
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:55,125
I am super confident, totally responsible
and fourth in line to raise Emma.

343
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:59,491
I'll be right there, Emma! Just let me
get my trusty diaper bag here.

344
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:07,771
Well, what do you know?
I guess I'll be the one who dies first.

345
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,848
-Does Monica know about her plates?
-Nope.

346
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:22,486
-Broke them all, huh?
-Yep.

347
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,445
-You gonna tell her?
-Nope.

348
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:29,889
Hey. So I'm gonna
put the plates back.

349
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:33,443
I think you're right. We shouldn't
use these plates for a long time.

350
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:37,009
-Like only if the queen comes?
-Maybe not even then.

351
00:23:38,013 --> 00:23:39,492
Hey. I did it.

352
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:43,049
I told my producer I had a family
emergency. He totally bought it.

353
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:47,684
-Thanks for teaching me how to lie.
-No problem. Next week, stealing.

354
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:51,846
-Bye, plates.
-You told her you broke all the plates?

355
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:56,812
What?!
Something happened with the plates?

356
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:01,968
Yeah, this raccoon came in....

357
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:06,922
