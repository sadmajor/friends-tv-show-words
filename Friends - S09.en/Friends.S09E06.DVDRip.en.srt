00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,452  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello.

2
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:18,647  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello.

3
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:20,367  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love my new job!

4
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,247  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Honey, you're screaming.
-You bet your ass I am!

5
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:25,290  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just had the best first day ever!

6
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:27,523  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
The kitchen?
Twice as big as Allessandro's.

7
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:29,445  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, that's great.

8
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:33,726  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
And clean? Not just health
department-clean, Monica-clean!

9
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:35,402  X1:275 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Awesome.

10
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:38,048  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, and the people are so nice.

11
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:40,209  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:523
There's this one guy, Jeffrey,
he's the maître d' .

12
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,450  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:523
Chandler, you will love him!

13
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:46,447  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
He is without a doubt
the funniest guy I have ever met!

14
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:50,529  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
The One With The Male Nanny

15
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:39,733  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:054 Y2:128
-This is nice.
-I know.

16
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:51,126  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:523
-You need both hands for that?
-Yeah, I kind of do.

17
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:53,249  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:523
Well, how's this?

18
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:09,925  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:054 Y2:094
Look at you two holding hands.

19
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:12,090  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
Is this getting serious?

20
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:15,924  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
Have you not talked about it yet?

21
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:19,524  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
Am I making you uncomfortable?

22
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,524  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
If you were bigger you'd hit me.

23
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:29,408  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:054 Y2:095
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:33,327  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:054 Y2:134
It's obviously way too early
for us to be having that conversation.

25
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:35,570  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Is it?
-Maybe not. Is it?

26
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:37,722  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:054 Y2:094
When I got divorced...

27
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:40,885  X1:095 X2:625 Y1:054 Y2:134
...I didn't think I'd feel this way about
someone for a really long time.

28
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:43,772  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:054 Y2:134
Then again, I didn't think I'd meet
someone like you. And....

29
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:47,846  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:054 Y2:133
This may be crazy-soon,
but I want you to have this.

30
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,130  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:054 Y2:095
No, not.... That's gum.

31
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:56,450  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, five bucks!
I love it when that happens, you know?

32
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,604  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You don't know it's there--
-I know. Keep digging.

33
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:00,042  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:054 Y2:094
Sorry.

34
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:05,402  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's a key.

35
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:08,804  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:523
To be honest, I think I'd prefer
the five dollars.

36
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,248  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:523
-It's to my apartment.
-Wow!

37
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,812  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
Big step for Phoebe and Mike.

38
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,045  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't want you to feel like you
have to give me your key....

39
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:20,847  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No, I want to.
-Thank God.

40
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:26,683  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:523
Wow. I was starting to think
I'd never meet someone that...

41
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:28,571  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:488 Y2:523
...I wanted to do this with.

42
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:31,051  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here you go.

43
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,763  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:444 Y2:523
-This is cool.
-It really is.

44
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:40,412  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know it. It is amazing.
These little things open doors!

45
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:46,284  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:523
So I don't go back to work
for another four weeks...

46
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:48,330  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but we would like our nanny
to start right away...

47
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:50,165  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
...so that Emma could get
a chance to know her.

48
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,410  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think that's really smart.

49
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:54,848  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:523
The easier we can make the
transition for her the better.

50
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,002  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's great. Great.

51
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:58,448  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
-So do you have any questions for us?
-Not really.

52
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,843  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right. Well, thank you
so much for coming.

53
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:03,481  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Thank you.
-It was really nice to meet you.

54
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:06,042  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:523
-We will call you.
-Oh, you know, wait.

55
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,851  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
I do have one question.

56
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:10,846  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do you guys do random drug testing?

57
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,647  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
Boy, we hadn't really thought of that.

58
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:19,601  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's cool. But if you do,
I'm gonna need three days' notice.

59
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,167  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okey-dokey!

60
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:24,292  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're never gonna find a nanny.

61
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:27,843  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:523
Come on, Rach. We will. I promise.
We have more interviews.

62
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:31,972  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:523
Worse comes to worst, we can always
reconsider the first one we met with.

63
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,769  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What, the blond with no bra?
-She was blond?

64
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:39,242  X1:270 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just a sec.

65
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,922  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, this one's name is Sandy.

66
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:45,768  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:442 Y2:523
She's got a degree in
Early Childhood Education.

67
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:50,252  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
She worked for her last family
for three years.

68
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:55,246  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi. I'm Sandy.

69
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:00,887  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:486 Y2:523
And she's a little mannish.

70
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:09,605  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God! David!

71
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:14,841  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
-ls this a bad time?
-No, it's a great time! Come in!

72
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:17,044  X1:282 X2:432 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow! Hi!

73
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:20,649  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?
Are you back from Minsk?

74
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:22,041  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Just for a couple of days.

75
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,688  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm here to explain to the people
who gave us our grant...

76
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:28,050  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:442 Y2:523
...why it's a positive thing that
we've spent all their money...

77
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:30,852  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and accomplished nothing.

78
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,245  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
Who cares? It got you here.

79
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,450  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
It got me to New York.
Then I got in a cab at the airport...

80
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:38,205  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and the guy said, "Where to?"

81
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:42,002  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:523
I just gave him your address.
I didn't even think about it.

82
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,367  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
Where's your luggage?

83
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:48,692  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:523
Damn it.

84
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:52,124  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, I'll call the cab company.

85
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,212  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:444 Y2:523
We can call them later.
Can you just stand there for a moment?

86
00:05:58,573 --> 00:05:59,688  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:482 Y2:523
Boy.

87
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,572  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:442 Y2:523
There's an old Russian expression
that goes:

88
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:08,484  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
Roughly translated, that means:

89
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:11,770  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:523
"This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."

90
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:15,167  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

91
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,769  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
You should see me when--
Actually, no, I look pretty good.

92
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:21,252  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you kidding?

93
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:23,973  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, when you don't see
someone for a long time...

94
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,488  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
...you build them up in your head,
you start thinking:

95
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,292  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Come on, don't be crazy,
nobody's that beautiful."

96
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:31,842  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
But, well, you are.

97
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,605  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, so are you seeing anyone?

98
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,566  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

99
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:43,123  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm just the worst person ever!

100
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,768  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
How can I not tell David
that I'm seeing Mike?

101
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,486  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

102
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:50,964  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:523
He said, "Are you seeing someone?"
and I said, "No."

103
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,767  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, that would've been your window.

104
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:58,529  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, I don't know.
I was looking in his eyes...

105
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:02,129  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and I was just thinking,
"Oh, my God, it's David. David's here."

106
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:04,602  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:486 Y2:523
He's so irresistible.

107
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,965  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Really? The scientist guy?
-Really? Chandler?

108
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,805  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:523
Continue.

109
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,042  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
Then it gets worse...

110
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:20,204  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
...because I told him
I would see him tomorrow night.

111
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,690  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Phoebe!
-I know! Evil!

112
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:31,052  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
I like Mike so much, you know?
It's just going really well. Oh, my God!

113
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,489  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:442 Y2:523
Isn't it ironic that David
would show up...

114
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,042  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
...on the same day that
you and Mike exchange keys?

115
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,685  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. You know, and given
my lifelong search for irony...

116
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:43,809  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
...you can imagine how happy I am!

117
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:49,169  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What are you gonna do?
-I mean, I guess I just have to...

118
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,689  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
...tell David that nothing
can happen between us.

119
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,049  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:486 Y2:523
Unless I don't.

120
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,124  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know, complicated moral situation?

121
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,853  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No right, no wrong?
-You have to tell David.

122
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:03,648  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:442 Y2:523
I knew I should've had this conversation
with Joey.

123
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:08,607  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:523
Funniest guy she's ever met.

124
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:10,764  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm funny, right?

125
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,363  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
What do you know? You're a door.

126
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:16,172  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
You just like knock-knock jokes.

127
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,048  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Save it for inside.

128
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:28,524  X1:075 X2:640 Y1:442 Y2:523
So Oklahoma's a crazy place. You know,
they call it the Sooner State.

129
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:31,048  X1:077 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:523
Frankly, I'd sooner be in any other state!

130
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:35,448  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:442 Y2:523
And what's with Oklahoma
having a panhandle?

131
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:37,251  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can all states have stuff like that?

132
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:40,644  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hey, yeah, I'm from the waistband
of Wyoming.

133
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,732  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
But when I was 7,
we headed over to the crotch.

134
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,931  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
Was your cabin pressurized?

135
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:52,165  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:442 Y2:523
And don't get me started on the way
the people from Tulsa talk.

136
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,048  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

137
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:59,843  X1:073 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
What's with the word "y'all"? You know,
just two words just pushed together?

138
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:03,562  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are we all allowed to do that?
Because if so, I say why stop there?

139
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,805  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, your new poodle
could be your noodle.

140
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,567  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:488 Y2:523
And fried chicken could be fricken.

141
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,528  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:523
Waiter? Waiter, excuse me,
I'll have the fricken!

142
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:17,768  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:482 Y2:523
See, that's funny with the fricken, right?

143
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:21,642  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, it just reminds me of something
this guy did today at work.

144
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:23,724  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
I told you about that funny guy, Jeffrey,
right?

145
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:25,731  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, he came up.

146
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:30,691  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, he did this bit.
You probably had to be there...

147
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:35,324  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but it was Liza Minnelli locked
in our freezer eating a raw chicken.

148
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,329  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Were you there?
-No, but it sounds fricken funny.

149
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:50,007  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:442 Y2:523
I really understand how hard it's gotta be
to leave your child with another person.

150
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,324  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, it's like leaving behind
a piece of your heart.

151
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:57,489  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Sandy, that's exactly what it is.

152
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:00,684  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you gay?

153
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,529  X1:071 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.

154
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:06,923  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:523
But I am straight. I'm engaged, actually.

155
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:10,087  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Her name's Delia.
-That's pretty.

156
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:15,965  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:442 Y2:523
So you're just, like,
a guy who's a nanny.

157
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:21,250  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
I realize how it's a bit unorthodox
for some people.

158
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:25,292  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
But I really believe the most satisfying
thing you can do with your life...

159
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:26,886  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
...is take care of a child.

160
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,885  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

161
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:32,772  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:523
Like at my last job.

162
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,969  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:523
I met Daniel when he was
3 weeks old.

163
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:38,603  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
And I got to watch him grow
into this awesome person.

164
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:41,765  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
When I left, I said, "I'll see you soon."

165
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,845  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
And he said to me, "Skadandy?"

166
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,729  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:488 Y2:523
That was his name for me.

167
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:53,724  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
"I'll see you every day right in...."

168
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:03,161  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:442 Y2:523
-lt's okay.
-Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.

169
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:09,603  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, God, she must need
her diaper changed.

170
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:14,289  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I can take care of that, if you want.
-That would be great.

171
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:19,730  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:486 Y2:523
I love him, I love him, I love him!

172
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,884  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
Come on. Rach, he's a guy!

173
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:24,244  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
So what? He's smart. He's qualified.

174
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:26,483  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
Give me one good reason
we shouldn't try him out.

175
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,004  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:486 Y2:523
Because it's weird!

176
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:31,562  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why?

177
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:34,128  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
What kind of a job is that for a man?
A nanny?

178
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,247  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:523
I mean, it's like if a woman
wanted to be--

179
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:38,641  X1:313 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes?

180
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,245  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
King?

181
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:47,443  X1:082 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
I hope you don't mind. I used
some of my homemade lotion on Emma.

182
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:51,572  X1:081 X2:634 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's a mixture of calendula and
honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up.

183
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:54,725  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
Plus, it keeps the hands young.

184
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,289  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yes! Sandy, you're hired!

185
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:05,450  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's great!

186
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:10,208  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:13,683  X1:070 X2:645 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's just such an emotional thing
when you're welcomed into a new family.

188
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,128  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, God. Come here.

189
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:20,924  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:523
You gotta be at least bi.

190
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:39,645  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
I need you to set me up for a joke.

191
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:42,168  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
When Monica's around,
ask me about fire trucks.

192
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:47,126  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know, Chandler. I'm not
so good with remembering lines.

193
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,887  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thank God your livelihood
doesn't depend on it.

194
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:53,805  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:523
I know, right?

195
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:56,212  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why are we doing this?

196
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:59,849  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:442 Y2:523
Monica says that her maître d' is
the funniest guy she's ever met.

197
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:03,847  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Seriously? She actually said that?
-Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?

198
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,852  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No! Being funny's your thing!
-Yeah!

199
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:10,449  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
Without that, you just got
"lame with women" !

200
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,488  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi! There you are.

201
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:13,847  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fire trucks!

202
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:28,446  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wow. You look even more beautiful
than you did yesterday.

203
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,528  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:523
In fact, I'm going to kiss you now.

204
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,522  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Wait, wait.
-I can't get away with stuff like that.

205
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:38,571  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
It sounded sexy in my head, so I....

206
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,844  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, no, it's not that.

207
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:46,042  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
Remember when you asked me if
I was seeing someone and I said no?

208
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:49,125  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:523
Well, I am. His name's Mike.

209
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,691  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I should've told you.
-No.

210
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:58,369  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, yeah.

211
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:04,650  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Well, it's okay. I understand.

212
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:06,611  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, are you happy with this guy?

213
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,810  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I am happy.
-Damn it.

214
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:12,291  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry. I don't mean that.
I want you to be happy.

215
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,604  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:523
But only with me. No, that's not fair.
Who cares. Leave him.

216
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:18,890  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't mean that. Yes, I do.
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:23,246  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think I should probably go.

218
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:27,282  X1:075 X2:641 Y1:444 Y2:523
But, David, I just want you to know that,
you know...

219
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,845  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
...telling you this is one of the
hardest things I've ever had to do.

220
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:34,644  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, just so you know...

221
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:37,805  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:523
...hearing it wasn't exactly
a Vladnik carnival, either.

222
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:44,045  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Can we at least hug goodbye?
-Of course. Yeah.

223
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:54,642  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, and a kiss on the cheek
wouldn't be totally inappropriate.

224
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:57,486  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No. No.
-I mean....

225
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:01,687  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:448 Y2:523
-In Minsk?
-Yeah?

226
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:04,367  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's two on each cheek...

227
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:09,288  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...and one on the lips.
-Well, if that's what they do in Minsk.

228
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,843  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:523
In New York, it's--

229
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:26,692  X1:288 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, boy.

230
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:32,362  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
Is everything all right?

231
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,644  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's fine.

232
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:38,488  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
Sandy was just telling me about how he
proposed to his fiancée...

233
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:40,445  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:488 Y2:523
...and it was so beautiful.

234
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:43,725  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
Her favorite flower is the camellia.
From the poem--

235
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,004  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't hear it again!

236
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:48,448  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know, I can't tell it again!

237
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:50,884  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I'm fine never having heard it.

238
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:57,449  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Rach, can I see you for a sec?
-Yeah. Excuse me.

239
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:05,441  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you realize that man has cried
in our apartment three times?

240
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,805  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
I haven't cried that many times
since I moved in!

241
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:12,210  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:523
Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.
That's all.

242
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:16,605  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, okay. See, that is the problem.
He is too sensitive.

243
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:18,645  X1:087 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:523
Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

244
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:22,852  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I mean, that guy--
These are amazing!

245
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:24,970  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
Sandy made madeleines.

246
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:28,285  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

247
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:33,766  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:523
What kind of a guy makes delicate
French cookies?

248
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:37,243  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:442 Y2:523
They're not even butch,
manly cookies with....

249
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,849  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:486 Y2:523
You know, with chunks!

250
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:46,452  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, you know,
I don't know what to say.

251
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:50,367  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:523
I mean, I never thought of you as a guy
who needed his men to be men.

252
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:55,971  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
I gotta tell you, Ross, it's not like you
just came in from branding cattle.

253
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:02,722  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hey, there's sensitive and
there's too sensitive.

254
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:05,653  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, what is too sensitive?

255
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:32,333  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I can't. I can't do this. It's bad.

256
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:37,045  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
But it's nice. And nice is good.

257
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:40,649  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
And good is not bad.
Ergo, we should keep kissing.

258
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:43,243  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No, no. No.
-But....

259
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,725  X1:310 X2:405 Y1:482 Y2:523
Ergo.

260
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,966  X1:072 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, David, if you had never left, then...

261
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,772  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
...yeah, we'd probably still be together
right now.

262
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:59,122  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
But you did leave. And I'm with Mike
and I really care about him.

263
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:04,846  X1:281 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:523
Goodbye.

264
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,285  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
The key works.

265
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:19,647  X1:084 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
And, you, thanks for the face massage!
Thank you!

266
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:25,090  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
Did Rachel tell you we hired
a male nanny?

267
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:26,681  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think that's great!

268
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:32,286  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
Did she tell you he plays the recorder,
recites poetry and bakes madeleines?

269
00:18:34,773 --> 00:18:39,449  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
-How are they?
-Lighter than air, but that's not the point.

270
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:43,963  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

271
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:46,292  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

272
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:48,444  X1:252 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:523
Guys do that?

273
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:50,968  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:442 Y2:523
-That's weird.
-Thank you!

274
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,289  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:523
-That's like a woman wanting to be--
-What?

275
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:56,889  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What's the end of that sentence?
-Yes. What is the end of that sentence?

276
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,765  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:523
A penis model!

277
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:09,926  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Anyway, did you tell Chandler
that some guy from work...

278
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,890  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
...is the funniest guy you ever met?

279
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:15,085  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Yeah. So?
-Wow!

280
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:18,088  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really? Do you not know Chandler?

281
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:24,244  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
Is that why he's acting so weird?
He's jealous?

282
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,528  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, that is crazy.

283
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:28,002  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:523
-It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey.
-So what?

284
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:32,849  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:442 Y2:523
Being funny is Chandler's thing.
Like Ross' thing is....

285
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:39,364  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Science?

286
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:42,889  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Academia? Being a good father?

287
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:50,482  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I can't believe he's that upset.
-You have to do some damage control.

288
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:51,927  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because he's feeling like--

289
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,884  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you guys talking about?

290
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:01,328  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

291
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:04,765  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
You got a man who's a nanny?

292
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,161  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:523
You got a "manny"?

293
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:17,364  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know, I don't mind a male nanny...

294
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,285  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:523
...but I do draw the line
at male wet nurse.

295
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,809  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:486 Y2:523
You are on a roll, mister!

296
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:30,446  X1:075 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
If I'd known you guys were coming over,
I would've brought more pizza.

297
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:36,652  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay! Okay! Stop it, you!
You stop it!

298
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,685  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
What is so funny about that?

299
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:44,610  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know, it's....
Just the way you say it.

300
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:48,561  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, you're funny. You have
that funny thing. You're a funny guy!

301
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,492  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
Did you tell her what we talked about?

302
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:06,842  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
So those were pity laughs?
Pity laughs?!

303
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,763  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, listen.

304
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,089  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
You have nothing to worry about
with Jeffrey.

305
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:14,289  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, yeah? Is he funnier than me?

306
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:17,042  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, you're different funny.

307
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:19,443  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:523
I mean, you're more sarcastic.

308
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:23,049  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, he does bits and impressions
and limericks.

309
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:24,402  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I do limericks.

310
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:29,843  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:448 Y2:523
There once was a man named Chandler
whose wife made him die inside.

311
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:33,847  X1:074 X2:641 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious.

312
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:35,844  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know that joke
you told me last week?

313
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:38,766  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
The one about Jerry Lewis
and the girl with the lazy eye.

314
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:40,446  X1:239 X2:475 Y1:482 Y2:523
That slayed me.

315
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:44,852  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey! I made up that joke
and told it to you.

316
00:21:48,413 --> 00:21:52,611  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Not knowing when to shut up.
-Yep, that's my thing.

317
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:00,804  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
So how many guys have your key?

318
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:03,724  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's not as bad as it looks.

319
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:05,890  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:523
I was saying goodbye to an old friend.

320
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:08,164  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
Your lipstick's on his mouth.

321
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:11,886  X1:075 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:523
We just happen to wear the same shade.

322
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:16,165  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, David and I did used to go out.

323
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:21,243  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
But years ago. And he lives in Minsk.
He's only in town for a couple days.

324
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:23,525  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Did you--?
-No. No.

325
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:25,285  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Kiss him?
-Oh, well, yeah.

326
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:29,845  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yes, but you should know,
she really likes you.

327
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:33,323  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:442 Y2:523
In fact, I don't think you realize
just how lucky you are, fella.

328
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:35,763  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Don't point your finger at me!
-Why?

329
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:37,446  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you gonna do about it?

330
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:40,407  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I'll show you
what I'm gonna do about it.

331
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:42,962  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Oh, really? Really?
-You want some of that?

332
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:49,685  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
Stop it! Stop it!
Before someone gets really hurt!

333
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:54,648  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here, David, you should just go.

334
00:22:54,813 --> 00:22:56,041  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right.

335
00:22:57,253 --> 00:23:01,769  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
But if I ever do come back from Minsk,
well, you just better watch out.

336
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:05,045  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
-If I go to Minsk, you better watch out.
-Oh, you're going to Minsk?

337
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:07,972  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well, I might.
-Really?

338
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:11,330  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, if you do, come in the spring.
It's just lovely there.

339
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,002  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, well, guys?

340
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,851  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Goodbye, Phoebe.
-Bye.

341
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:20,443  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey, what, are you kidding me?
-Right-o. Right-o.

342
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:25,844  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:523
Take good care of her.

343
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,643  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

344
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:34,010  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you want your key back,
I totally understand.

345
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,491  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
-lt's never gonna happen again, right?
-Right. Never. I swear.

346
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:46,046  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just want to say, if you do ever
come to Minsk, that's my number.

347
00:23:46,213 --> 00:23:49,523  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
We'll party up Vladnik-style.

348
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,326  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah! All right!

349
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:10,732  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, Ross! Check it out!
Sandy taught me "Hot Cross Buns" !

350
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:13,727  X1:078 X2:638 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really? Sounded like "Three Blind Mice."

351
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:16,732  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:523
-"Three Blind Mice" goes like this.
-I swear to God.

352
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,848  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Who's up for puppets?
-Me! I'm up for puppets!

353
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:26,732  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, please welcome:

354
00:24:26,893 --> 00:24:28,770  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
The Snufflebumps!

355
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:32,448  X1:084 X2:632 Y1:444 Y2:523
Who wants to be Mr. Wigglemunch and
who's gonna be the Grumpus?

356
00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:37,607  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
How exactly is a 2-month-old
supposed to appreciate puppets?

357
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:41,932  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Studies show that the movement and
colors help their cerebral development.

358
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:45,483  X1:077 X2:638 Y1:482 Y2:523
The whimsical characters are just for us.

359
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:52,166  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
I want to be Mr. Wigglemunch!

360
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:54,487  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

361
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:57,327  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I guess we know who's
gonna be the Grumpus!

362
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:05,121  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
-That was kind of rude.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

363
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:09,172  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Please apologize to Sandy
and the Snufflebumps for me.

364
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,531  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You know, he was just doing his job.
-You know what?

365
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:18,643  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't
in love with Gary Poppins out there.

366
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:23,481  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:523
But I just-- I can't go through with this.

367
00:25:23,853 --> 00:25:25,252  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Come on.
-No! You know what?

368
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:30,248  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
I would never force you to hire someone
you were this uncomfortable with.

369
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:35,570  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's true.

370
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:36,848  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

371
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:39,323  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
You want to fire him,
so you have to go do it.

372
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:47,647  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
So you see, Wigglemunch,
that's why it's important to share.

373
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:53,044  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
I am learning so much from you.

374
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:58,967  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:523
Well, I'm off to Tulsa.

375
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,450  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:442 Y2:523
So if your maître d' friend
has any funny Oklahoma jokes...

376
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:07,164  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:523
...tell him to e-mail me at
www-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com!

377
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:10,806  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, you can relax.

378
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:14,244  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
Last night at work Jeffrey
told this really sexist joke.

379
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:17,211  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
-After that, not so funny anymore.
-Really?

380
00:26:17,573 --> 00:26:21,043  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:442 Y2:523
See, that's the thing.
You gotta keep it smart, people!

381
00:26:22,253 --> 00:26:24,403  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:442 Y2:523
Don't miss that flight.
You know I love you.

382
00:26:24,773 --> 00:26:26,843  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you too.

383
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:30,648  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
-And I like you as a friend.
-Right.

384
00:26:30,813 --> 00:26:33,247  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:444 Y2:523
-See you later.
-See you.

385
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:38,129  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Did the guy really make that joke?
-No, he still kills me.

386
00:26:38,293 --> 00:26:42,411  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
Last night he had me laughing so hard,
I swear a little pee came out.

387
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:51,528  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here goes.

388
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:54,884  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.

389
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,686  X1:273 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:523
Sandy? Hi.

390
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,525  X1:298 X2:417 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hi.
-We....

391
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:04,649  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:488 Y2:523
We kind of need to talk.

392
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,688  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm afraid it's not working out.

393
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:20,448  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:523
I mean, Rachel and I think you are great
with Emma.

394
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:23,730  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:448 Y2:523
-We just feel--
-You! You feel!

395
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:28,885  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just feel...

396
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:32,284  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:442 Y2:523
...that the chemistry isn't right.
I'm sorry.

397
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:35,013  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:442 Y2:523
We're more than happy to give you
a good recommendation.

398
00:27:35,373 --> 00:27:39,412  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, that's okay. I had a lot of offers
from other families.

399
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:41,768  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just picked you guys because...

400
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:45,846  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...I liked you the best.
-Oh, damn you, Geller!

401
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:51,851  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:442 Y2:523
Anyway, well I'm glad
there's no hard feelings.

402
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:56,684  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
None at all. You need to be happy
with whoever is in your home.

403
00:27:56,893 --> 00:28:00,283  X1:080 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:523
Although, if you don't mind telling me...

404
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:03,763  X1:091 X2:623 Y1:442 Y2:523
...what was the problem? Maybe it's
something I can work on in the future.

405
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:09,846  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, you know, it's nothing you did.
It's my issue.

406
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:12,446  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it?

407
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:16,371  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please?

408
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:26,002  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, I'm just not that comfortable
with a guy who's as sensitive as you.

409
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:28,002  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's fair.

410
00:28:29,013 --> 00:28:32,483  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:523
Although, can I ask,
why do you think that is?

411
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:34,845  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why? I don't know.

412
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,687  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe because of my father?

413
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,242  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, when I was growing up,
he was a tough guy.

414
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:57,124  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know, and as a kid,
I wasn't the athlete I am now.

415
00:28:58,373 --> 00:29:01,046  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:523
I play squash!

416
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:09,851  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
Anyway, I always got the feeling
he thought I was too sensitive.

417
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,607  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
That must have been hard.

418
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:15,049  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was hard.

419
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:21,247  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
I remember I was in my bedroom,
playing with my dinosaurs....

420
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,567  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
Playing and learning.

421
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:31,730  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:444 Y2:523
And my father walks in and says,
"What are you doing with those things?

422
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:37,610  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:442 Y2:523
What's wrong with you? Why aren't you
outside playing like a real boy?"

423
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:41,050  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:523
-But you are a real boy.
-I know I am!

424
00:29:43,253 --> 00:29:48,168  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:442 Y2:523
And when it's summer and it's hot,
why can't you wear a tank top?!

425
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:55,443  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's all right. Crying is good.
It lets the boo-hoos out.

426
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:58,803  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here comes some more!

427
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:08,970  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:054 Y2:129
And what's the one kind of boat
that can never ever sink?

428
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:13,929  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:054 Y2:133
-What kind?
-A friend ship!

429
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:18,930  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:054 Y2:094
Wow! You blow my mind!

430
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:22,769  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:054 Y2:094
I gotta go.

431
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,651  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:054 Y2:133
-How much do I owe you?
-Twenty bucks.

432
00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:28,165  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:054 Y2:095
It's like the cheapest college ever!
