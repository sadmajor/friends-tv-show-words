1
00:00:02,823 --> 00:00:03,972
Oh, hey, you guys?

2
00:00:04,143 --> 00:00:06,816
I couldn't get a reservation
for the night of my birthday...

3
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:09,059
...so we'll have to do dinner
Thursday night.

4
00:00:09,263 --> 00:00:13,973
-Thursday? But that's Halloween.
-So?

5
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:16,379
It's just spooky, that's all.

6
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:19,015
So is Mike coming to dinner?

7
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:22,818
No. It's my first birthday
with a boyfriend, and he has to work.

8
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:26,862
I'd get mad at him, but I think
it's too soon to show my true colors.

9
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:31,899
I would make the reservation for five.
One of us has to stay with Emma.

10
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:34,054
-Which one of us should go to dinner?
-Rachel!

11
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:40,222
Actually, I was thinking
maybe both of us could go.

12
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,816
Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thought
into your gift.

13
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:49,259
All right, so great, we can all go now.

14
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:51,778
That is fun! Hey! You know what?

15
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:55,492
We all haven't been together,
the six of us, in such a long time.

16
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:57,819
What are you talking about?
We're together now.

17
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:00,491
Mon? Chandler's not here.

18
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,416
Oh, dear God.

19
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:08,859
The One With Phoebe's Birthday Dinner

20
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,336
Hello. It's nice to see
our team together for the first time.

21
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:49,779
Now, before we get started,
are there any questions?

22
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:51,621
-Yes. Ken, is it?
-That's right.

23
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:54,860
Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa is,
you fell asleep in a meeting...

24
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:57,901
...and took the job without realizing
what you were saying yes to?

25
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:02,941
Well, don't believe
everything you hear, Ken.

26
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:04,582
But yeah, that's true.

27
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:11,023
All right, let's get started by taking
a look at last quarter's figures.

28
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:16,295
Claudia, aren't you supposed
to blow smoke up the boss's ass?

29
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:22,580
-I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
-No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.

30
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,052
Right now, I can't remember why.

31
00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:27,933
You're not allowed to smoke
in this office, right?

32
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:31,579
Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke
in offices with 15 people or less.

33
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:35,258
-Would you like one?
-All right, look. I don't smoke anymore.

34
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:38,580
But if the rest of you want to light up,
go ahead, it's fine.

35
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:44,133
So you all smoke, then?

36
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:47,261
You know, it's almost rude
that I'm not smoking.

37
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:49,738
-That's not true. If you don't want--
-Ken, please!

38
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:55,861
No, I can't. I can't smoke.
If I smoke, my wife would kill me.

39
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:58,213
I'm sorry, but isn't your wife
back in New York?

40
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:03,021
I've always liked you, Ken.

41
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:10,822
Trick or treat.

42
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:14,100
-Hey.
-And "treat" it is.

43
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:18,893
Wow. So glad I changed.

44
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:23,092
I almost wore my threadbare robe
that can't contain my breasts.

45
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:27,259
This is not what I'm wearing.
I'm ovulating...

46
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:30,699
...and Chandler's gonna be home.
So I thought we would try before dinner.

47
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:34,452
Wait, does that--? You guys won't
be late for my dinner, will you?

48
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:36,494
We haven't seen each other
in over a week.

49
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:38,415
We'll probably be the first ones there.

50
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:41,260
Okay. See you there. Happy humping.

51
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,982
Hey. Well, hey!

52
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:48,375
Wow, somebody smoked out here?

53
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,819
My God, don't people know you're
not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

54
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:59,893
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking's legal
in offices with fewer than 15 people.

55
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:01,821
Oh, you smoked.

56
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:06,574
No. I just happen to know a lot of trivia
about smoking in different states.

57
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:11,134
For example, in Hawaii,
cigarettes are called lei-lana-lukus.

58
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:16,820
-Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes!
-Do you think Monica will smell it?

59
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,379
Are you kidding? That woman
has the nose of a bloodhound.

60
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:23,819
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.

61
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:29,139
Pheebs?

62
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,819
I'm gonna go.

63
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:38,699
Okay. Something to cover the smell.

64
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:44,013
Oven cleaner.

65
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:50,778
Unscented.

66
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:53,816
Welcome home.

67
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:57,659
I've missed you.

68
00:04:57,823 --> 00:05:02,180
-You want to join me in the bedroom?
-No, thanks, I'm good.

69
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:06,861
Okay. So you want to play it
that way, do you?

70
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:09,652
Well, you know what, actually,
I just got off a plane...

71
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:12,058
...so I'm feeling gross.
I should take a shower.

72
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:15,858
-Come here, you don't need a shower.
-All right, the truth is...

73
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:18,776
...I soiled myself
during some turbulence.

74
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:25,535
What do I smell? I smell smoke.

75
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:27,773
Did you smoke?

76
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:30,696
Yes. But I just had one.

77
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,262
Two.

78
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:35,062
Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five.

79
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:40,412
A pack. Two pack-- A carton.

80
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,972
Three big fat cartons in two days!

81
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:47,581
But it's over. I've made a decision,
I'm not gonna smoke anymore.

82
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,142
Well, those are for you.

83
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:58,654
All right. Well, we'll just see you
when you get here. Bye.

84
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:02,301
Oh, that was my mom.
She's stuck in terrible traffic.

85
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:05,142
That is now the third sign
that I should not leave Emma.

86
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:08,221
-What are the other two?
-Well, the first one is, I don't want to.

87
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,739
And second one, I'm not going.

88
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:14,377
I know this is the first time
we're leaving the baby.

89
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,499
I know how hard it is for you. But....

90
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:19,655
But everything's gonna be fine.
I mean, my mom is gonna be with her.

91
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:21,893
-She's great with kids.
-She is?

92
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,099
Yeah.

93
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,782
What about Monica?

94
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:29,896
You only hear Monica's side of that.
Okay, that little fatso was a terror!

95
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:36,974
-I just don't think I can do it.
-Know what? You can and you should.

96
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,060
Really, it will be good for you.

97
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:40,622
In fact, you know what?

98
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,343
Go ahead to the restaurant,
and I will wait for my mom...

99
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,052
...and then I'll meet you there.
No, no, really, you should go. Go out.

100
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:53,492
Really, the world is your oyster.
Kick up your heels. Paint the town red!

101
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:58,501
-You need to learn some new slang.
-I'm serious. Come on, you should go.

102
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:01,422
Here. No, just go.

103
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,460
-Well--
-No, no! You know what?

104
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:07,457
You're not getting back in there!
The baby's fine. Now, scram!

105
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:11,333
Yeah, tell your story walking!

106
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:15,377
I was just going to say
that I left my keys.

107
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,900
Holy moley, are we in a pickle now!

108
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:28,500
Where is everyone?
They're 40 minutes late.

109
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:30,580
-I know.
-I'm starving.

110
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,343
I knew we were coming here tonight.
I ate nothing all day.

111
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:35,579
What about me?
I only had one lunch today.

112
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:40,056
So are we expecting
the rest of our party shortly?

113
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:42,493
Yes, they are expected presently.
Yeah.

114
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:46,133
Their arrival is in the offing.

115
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:48,499
Right. We have a table for two available.

116
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:50,255
-Perhaps you'd--
-No, they're coming.

117
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:51,856
We're waiting right here.

118
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:54,654
Joseph!

119
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:59,175
One needn't worry.
They shan't be long.

120
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:02,779
It's just that we do have
some large parties waiting.

121
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,781
Oh, one really does have a stick
up one's ass, doesn't one?

122
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:11,580
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad?

123
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,412
Where the little kid walks
through Grandpa? It's chilling!

124
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,342
I messed up. It was a meeting.
Everybody was smoking.

125
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:20,579
So what? Don't you have any willpower?

126
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:23,581
Willpower? I've watched home movies
of you eating Ding Dongs...

127
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,495
...without taking the tinfoil off!

128
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,972
You said that was sexy!

129
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,179
Okay, look, can we just drop this?
I'm not gonna smoke again.

130
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:37,777
That's right, because I forbid you
to smoke again.

131
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,894
You forbid me?

132
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,253
I've flown a long way
to see my loving wife.

133
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:44,254
Is she here, by the way?

134
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:50,174
Chandler, don't joke with me. Okay?
I'm very, very upset right now.

135
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:53,261
-ls this the most upset you could be?
-I think so.

136
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,454
Well, then I might as well...

137
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:57,654
...do this.

138
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:09,942
Not really sure what to do now.

139
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,572
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

140
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:16,211
We're already late
for Phoebe's birthday dinner.

141
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:18,214
So you're going to put out
that cigarette...

142
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:21,102
...we're gonna put this fight on hold,
and go have sex.

143
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:24,215
Fine. What?

144
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:27,142
Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating.
If we don't do it...

145
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:29,373
...we're gonna have to wait
until next month!

146
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,454
You're serious?

147
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:34,979
-Oh, yeah!
-All right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking!

148
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:38,021
-And no cuddling.
-And no kissing your neck.

149
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:41,533
Oh, good! I hate it when you do that!

150
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:46,295
And lots of kissing your neck!

151
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:48,821
Okay, well, the super's not home.

152
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:51,451
But my mother's gonna be here,
and she has the key.

153
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:54,735
I can't wait that long. You have to do
something. Knock that door down!

154
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,013
I would, but I bruise like a peach.

155
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:03,097
Besides, you know, everything's
gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.

156
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:07,342
-What if she jumps out of the bassinet?
-Can't hold her head up, but jumped.

157
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:10,214
Oh, my God!
I left the water running!

158
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:14,092
You did not leave the water running.
Please, pull yourself together, okay?

159
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:18,421
-Well, did I leave the stove on?
-You haven't cooked since 1996.

160
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:22,213
Is the window open? If the window's
open a bird could fly in and....

161
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,220
My God, you know what?
I think you're right.

162
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,736
-Listen.
-What? What?

163
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:30,135
A pigeon. No. No, wait, no.
An eagle flew in!

164
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,061
Landed on the stove and caught fire!

165
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:41,974
The baby, seeing this, jumps across
the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.

166
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,862
The eagle, however, misconstrues this
as an act of aggression...

167
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,661
...and grabs the baby in its talon.

168
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:49,940
Meanwhile, the faucet
fills the apartment with water.

169
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:53,459
Baby and bird, still ablaze,
are locked in a death grip...

170
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:58,253
...swirling around the whirlpool
that fills the apartment!

171
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,973
Boy, are you gonna be sorry
if that's true.

172
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:08,061
-Hello.
-Hi.

173
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:10,094
It's been an hour.

174
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:14,097
The maitre d' asked if you'd reconsider
switching to a smaller table.

175
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,816
Maybe we should just eat now.

176
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:19,453
You can't order until the entire
party's arrived. Restaurant policy.

177
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:22,461
Well, how about this?
Another table leaves, right...

178
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:25,535
...but there's still some food left
on their plates.

179
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:29,013
Okay, what's the restaurant's policy
about people eating that?

180
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:32,021
-It's frowned upon.
-But it happens.

181
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:37,778
-All right, I got to go to the bathroom.
-You can't go.

182
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:40,099
No, no, no.
I can't hold this table on my own.

183
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:42,219
If they ask me to move, I'll cave.

184
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:44,300
Well, if you ask me to stay, I'll pee.

185
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:52,572
Good evening, miss.

186
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:55,379
Miss?

187
00:11:57,303 --> 00:11:59,578
Miss? Miss?

188
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:04,134
Okay, fine, I'll move. All right.
You don't have to manhandle me.

189
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:08,459
Where? Okay.

190
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:12,902
Thank you. Wow.

191
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:20,342
Finally. You guys made it.

192
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,337
Pheebs, who the hell--?

193
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:38,299
Spend more time with the tie!
That will make a baby.

194
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:43,221
Look, I can't do this. I can't make love
to you while we're fighting this way.

195
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:45,618
Oh, sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.

196
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:48,343
But when you wanted to have sex
after my uncle's funeral--

197
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:50,534
That was a celebration of life!

198
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:53,701
All right, I'm not gonna do this.

199
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:56,292
Is this the way you want our baby
to be conceived?

200
00:12:57,663 --> 00:13:00,052
No, you're right.

201
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,381
No, we shouldn't do it like this.

202
00:13:05,423 --> 00:13:08,017
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

203
00:13:08,183 --> 00:13:11,334
I shouldn't have come down on you
so hard about the smoking.

204
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:15,332
So you had a few cigarettes.
It's not the end of the world.

205
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:18,011
-Really?
-Yeah.

206
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,414
You are incredible.

207
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,017
And listen,
I'm not gonna smoke again.

208
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:26,141
And if I do, I promise
I will hide it so much better from you.

209
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:34,862
-Want to?
-Let's celebrate life!

210
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,059
Okay!

211
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:40,853
Oh, God.

212
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:42,820
Oh, thank God you're okay.

213
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,378
I'm sorry we left.
Mommy will never leave you again.

214
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:48,455
Never, ever, ever again.

215
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:50,415
Great. So let's get going.

216
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:55,054
I mean it. After what just happened,
I'm never leaving her again.

217
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:57,902
I understand. Separation is hard.

218
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:01,897
One time I was about to leave Ross
to go to the beauty parlor.

219
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:04,702
And he got so upset
he took off all his clothes...

220
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:07,980
...tucked his willy between his legs...

221
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:12,773
...and cried out, "Mommy, I'm a girl.
Take me with you."

222
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:24,221
Somehow, over time,
it got easier to be apart from you.

223
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:31,976
You are welcome.

224
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:36,215
-You know what? Let's not talk.
-What?

225
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:39,733
-I am still so mad at you for smoking!
-But you said you forgave me.

226
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:42,736
It was just a couple of cigarettes,
no big deal.

227
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:48,980
I was ovulating and you said you
wouldn't have sex if we were fighting.

228
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:55,295
-You tricked me to get me into bed?
-That's right. I got mine.

229
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:00,422
I feel so used.

230
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:04,979
Well, I guess they're not coming.
You want to just order?

231
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,574
Thank you.

232
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:14,054
Waiter? All right, this is gonna
go fast, so try to keep up.

233
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:16,254
Risotto with shaved truffles
and the rib steak...

234
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:18,857
...with the golden chanterelles
and the Bordelaise sauce...

235
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:22,379
...unless any of that stuff I just said
means "snails."

236
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:25,900
-lt does not.
-Tomato tart...

237
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:27,980
...and which of the pastas
would you recommend?

238
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,856
-Oh, well they're both exquisite--
-Both it is. Thank you.

239
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:33,139
Oh, can I make a special request?

240
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:35,100
Can you bring everything
as it's ready?

241
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:37,219
-Appetizers, entrées, we don't care.
-Hey!

242
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:43,254
-I'll wait to put your order in.
-You guys are over an hour late.

243
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,493
-What happened to you two?
-So sorry.

244
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,894
-We got locked out of the apartment.
-That's a great story. Can I eat it?

245
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:52,701
And then Rachel wasn't sure
she could leave the baby.

246
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:56,173
It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday
and I did what I had to do.

247
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,732
And that's Judy over there at the bar
with Emma?

248
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:05,335
This is for the best. I'm not distracted,
worrying about Emma...

249
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:08,973
...how she's doing at home, and I'm
gonna be completely here with you.

250
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:10,901
-Oh, she spit up. She spit up.
-What?

251
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:13,657
Judy? She spit--
Judy, look alive, Judy!

252
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:19,252
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

253
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:23,896
Oh, everything looks delicious.

254
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,692
What should I have?
What should I have?

255
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,572
Never hit a woman.
Never hit a woman.

256
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:34,379
I know what you mean,
this menu's incredible.

257
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,336
Ross bruises like a peach.
He bruises like a peach.

258
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,613
Okay, I'll have the fig salad
and the duck.

259
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:42,541
I'll have the soup and the salmon.

260
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:44,620
Remember, whatever comes up first,
okay?

261
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:46,102
-Hurry--
-Happy birthday!

262
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:47,372
Son of a bitch!

263
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:51,461
-Where have you been?
-Well, we had a little fight.

264
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,534
I would never lie
to get someone into bed.

265
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:57,173
You used to tell girls
you were a Kennedy.

266
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:01,014
Thanks.

267
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,102
Thanks. Wow.

268
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:08,016
A little tight, isn't it?
Why didn't you get a bigger table?

269
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:13,301
You had a big table
but they made you move.

270
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:14,862
Shut up, Monica.

271
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:20,771
Oh, well, I suppose that Chandler
will have the smoked duck.

272
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:27,012
And I suppose that Monica
will have the manipulative shrew.

273
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:29,612
-I'll give you another minute.
-What, where you going?

274
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:32,337
He said she wanted the shrew!

275
00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:35,181
Rach, come on, Emma's fine.

276
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:39,376
You're turning into an obsessive
mother, okay? You need to stop.

277
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:44,539
You ever hear the story about when
Ross' mom went to the beauty salon?

278
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:50,493
-You mean the willy story?
-They already know it.

279
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:56,139
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

280
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:57,736
-You should order.
-That's okay.

281
00:17:57,903 --> 00:18:00,656
-I told the waiter what they want.
-Why would you do that?

282
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,093
Chandler, control your woman.

283
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,337
Okay, well....
Everybody has ordered.

284
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:12,897
I would like to start the celebration
and make a toast to Phoebe.

285
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:16,294
-She dropped her sock.
-What?

286
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:19,861
-No. No, Emma dropped her sock.
-Mom's here?

287
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:23,897
I wanted to have lunch with her today.
She told me she was out of town.

288
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,015
She still has not noticed
that the baby's sock is on the ground.

289
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,418
It's a good toast.

290
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:32,137
Look, will you please get her attention?

291
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:35,138
Mommy?

292
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,814
Oh, for God's sake, Judy,
pick up the sock!

293
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:48,941
Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!

294
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:54,934
I'm sorry, was that rude?

295
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:58,856
Did my little outburst...

296
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:03,056
...blunt the hideousness
that is this evening?

297
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:05,060
Look, I know you have a lot going on...

298
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:10,900
...but all I wanted to do was have
dinner with my friends on my birthday.

299
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:16,376
And you are all so late, and you
didn't even have the courtesy to call.

300
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:20,534
Well, it's too late now.

301
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:22,382
Pheebs, I don't think that's us.

302
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:27,822
Oh, well, this is-- This is not over!
Hello?

303
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:33,452
-What is going on with you two?
-Well, you see, I'm ovulating.

304
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:36,137
Oh, yeah, that's what she says.

305
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:41,701
Maybe you're not ovulating. Maybe
it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.

306
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:46,336
Yeah, Smokey, that's what it was.
I just can't get enough.

307
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:48,621
You're not gonna believe this.

308
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:51,013
She tricked me
into having sex with her.

309
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:54,575
So? You got to have sex, right?

310
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:58,413
What's the matter with me?
Why am I such a girl?

311
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:02,820
-Okay. That was Mike.
-Oh, Phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.

312
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:06,055
You are totally right.
We are here 100 percent...

313
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:09,454
...and we love you, and we are ready
to start your birthday celebration.

314
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:12,700
You guys, that means the world to me.

315
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:17,102
Okay, I'm gonna take off.

316
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:20,217
What?

317
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:22,698
I love you guys too, but
Mike got off work early.

318
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:24,615
Wait.

319
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:29,139
I'm not the-- I'm not the kind of girl
that just ditches her friends...

320
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:31,453
...to be with her boyfriend.

321
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:32,891
You know what? I am.

322
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:36,172
Bye, guys. Judy! Bye.

323
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:40,181
If Phoebe's gone,
can we take Emma home?

324
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:44,256
That's a good idea. Our babysitter
just pounded another chardonnay.

325
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:45,617
-Bye, you guys.
-Bye.

326
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:49,856
See you. Well, I guess it's just us.

327
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:57,135
So I'm probably still ovulating.
Do you want to give it another try?

328
00:20:57,383 --> 00:21:00,455
So you've never had sex
with a Kennedy, have you?

329
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:03,733
-You're gonna go do it?
-We don't have much time.

330
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:05,973
Once the egg descends into the
fallopian tube--

331
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,935
Oh, wait, oh, get out of here!

332
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:15,334
I sincerely hope the rest of your party
is returning.

333
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,773
No, just me. All alone.

334
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,936
Dinner for six for one.

335
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:28,773
Well, you boys are about
to see something really special.

336
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:42,662
-How was everything?
-Excellent.

337
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:46,133
The shrew, in particular, was exquisite.

338
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,781
I hope you've got some room left.

339
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:58,178
Joey. Joey.

340
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:04,052
This is the best birthday ever!

341
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:07,532
