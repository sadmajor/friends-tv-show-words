1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,329  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
Have you seen our bank statement?
Can this be right?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,129  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:442 Y2:523
I know. God, I haven't seen
my savings take a hit like this...

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,657  X1:098 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:523
...since I was a kid and they came up
with Double Stuf Oreos.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,529  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What happened to all of our money?
-I'm not sure exactly what they did...

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,214  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:486 Y2:523
...but I'm inclined to blame Enron.

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,573  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
With you doing the internship, we're
spending more than we're bringing in.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,129  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, maybe I should quit
and get a job that pays.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,808  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:442 Y2:523
But you're finally doing something
that you love.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,289  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:523
I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,409  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
Although it would be nice if the thing
that you loved was finding gold.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,219  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, I think we're making
too big a deal out of this.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,134  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
We'll pay our bills late this month. Next
month we'll cut back on a few things.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,373  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
And maybe we start eating
out of Joey's refrigerator for a change.

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,499  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're a chef. What can you make
out of baking soda and beer?

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,533  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
Worst-case scenario is, we borrow
some money from my parents.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,418  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, we're not borrowing money.

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,413  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Why not?
-We don't do that. We are Bings.

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,928  X1:150 X2:570 Y1:442 Y2:523
If there's one thing my father
taught me, it was...

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,696  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
...well, to always knock
before going into the pool house.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,416  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
-The other thing is, never borrow money.
-I had no idea you had this much pride.

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,255  X1:073 X2:645 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's right, I do. I am your man.
I'm gonna get us through this situation...

22
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,810  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:523
...even if it means you working
twice as hard.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,017  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
The One With the Boob Job

24
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,931  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:054 Y2:134
-I'm gonna go.
-Why?

25
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,938  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:442 Y2:523
I haven't been home in days,
and I need to get more clothes.

26
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,813  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:054 Y2:134
You don't have to go.
I have something that'll fit you.

27
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,932  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:054 Y2:094
I put that tube top on as a joke.

28
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,580  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:054 Y2:133
-I want you to stay.
-I want to stay too.

29
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,208  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:054 Y2:129
But I've got as much use
out of these boxers as I can.

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,497  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Why don't you turn them inside--
-Done it.

31
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,098  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'll be back in a couple of hours.
-All right. I'll miss you.

32
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,416  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:054 Y2:089
Me too.

33
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,696  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:054 Y2:133
You know what? I just realized
something. I don't want to go home.

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,018  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.
-No, no, what I mean is...

35
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,899  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:054 Y2:133
...I hate going back
to my apartment now.

36
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,093  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:054 Y2:128
Partly because I live above
a known crack den...

37
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,332  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:054 Y2:133
...but, you know, mostly because
when I'm there, I really miss you.

38
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,170  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:054 Y2:089
So...

39
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,413  X1:107 X2:614 Y1:054 Y2:094
...do you want to move in together?

40
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,455  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:054 Y2:094
Wow, Mike Hanigan...

41
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,692  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
...you sure know how to
make a girl say "Hell, yeah."

42
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,736  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
-So we're doing it?
-Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.

43
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,254  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:523
-We're really gonna move in together?
-Yeah.

44
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,574  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
I've always wanted to live with a guy.

45
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,379  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:523
Pick up your socks.
Put down the toilet seat.

46
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,010  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, we are not having sex anymore.

47
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,740  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's gonna be fun.

48
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,173  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey.

49
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,929  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
Listen, I need to know
that what I'm about to ask you...

50
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,536  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
...will never get back to Chandler.

51
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,138  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
thought about it myself.

52
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,653  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
But Chandler is my best friend.
It would be wrong.

53
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,778  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:523
Good, but wrong.

54
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,336  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, first of all, it would be great.

55
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,731  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
But that's not what I'm here to talk
to you about. I need to borrow money.

56
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,012  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, I don't know, Monica.
You know...

57
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,091  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
...lending friends money
is always a mistake.

58
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,373  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
-But Chandler lent you money.
-And he would tell you it was a mistake.

59
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,010  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:523
Come on, I just.... I need it
for some rent and some other bills.

60
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,169  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, how much?

61
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,059  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Two thousand dollars?
-Two thousand dollars?

62
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,690  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
What do you think I am,
a soap opera star?

63
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,454  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah.
-That's right, I am.

64
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,250  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

65
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,617  X1:079 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
-What's in the bag?
-You know how Emma started crawling?

66
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,568  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
I realized that this place
is very unsafe for a baby...

67
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,494  X1:083 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
...so I went to the store and I got some
stuff to baby-proof the apartment.

68
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,611  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, God, baby-proofing.

69
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,130  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:446 Y2:523
Why is it such a big deal now?
You know, when I was a kid, it was like:

70
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,417  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs."

71
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,573  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:442 Y2:523
Or, "Whoops, Joey electrocuted
himself again."

72
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,169  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Anyway, are you going to get
a handyman to install this stuff?

73
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,696  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, I was just gonna do it myself.

74
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,619  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You're gonna do it?
-Yeah. Why?

75
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,376  X1:088 X2:632 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You don't think a woman can do this?
-Women can. You can't.

76
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,453  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Monica, will you please tell Joey
that he is a pig.

77
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,215  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You're a pig. And you can't do this.
-What?

78
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,770  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
What? Come on, I found
the hardware store all by myself.

79
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,732  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
The store's right down the street.

80
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,330  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
There is a hardware store
right down the street?

81
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,852  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, you guys?
Okay, we've got great news.

82
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,296  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Phoebe and I are moving in together.
-Congratulations.

83
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,850  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:442 Y2:523
I know, it's so exciting. You know,
I've never lived with a guy before.

84
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,814  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, it's just like living with a girl,
only they don't steal your makeup.

85
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,251  X1:106 X2:614 Y1:442 Y2:523
Unless they're playing "This Is What
My Sister Would Look Like."

86
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,569  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:523
Yeah, she's not so cute.

87
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,297  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
-Well, you put down the toilet seat.

88
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,377  X1:277 X2:439 Y1:486 Y2:523
Yes, dear.

89
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,616  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
-ls that a bit you guys do?
-Uh-huh. We're playing you two.

90
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,972  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:523
We don't do that.
Tell her we don't do that.

91
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,212  X1:277 X2:439 Y1:486 Y2:523
Yes, dear.

92
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,571  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't believe you're moving in
together. I'm happy for you guys.

93
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,698  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I hear wedding bells.
-Monica, slow down, okay?

94
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,420  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm just excited to be living with him.

95
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,491  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:523
You know, I mean, I don't know...

96
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,936  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
...can I see someday being
married to Mike? Sure. Yeah.

97
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,410  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
I could picture myself walking down
the aisle in a wedding dress...

98
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,936  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that highlights my breasts
in an obvious yet classy way.

99
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,693  X1:080 X2:639 Y1:444 Y2:523
But do I want that house in Connecticut
near the good schools...

100
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,331  X1:143 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
...where Mike and I could send
little Sophie and Mike Jr.?

101
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,138  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, I do.

102
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,092  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I had no idea you were so conventional.
-I know. I guess I am.

103
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,775  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,
I want to be a soccer mom.

104
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,335  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You ready to go?
-Yeah, you bet, roomie.

105
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,657  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:523
Don't you mean "groomie"?

106
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,211  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What are you talking about?
-Please.

107
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,010  X1:079 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
We haven't even moved in yet, and
they have us picking out china patterns.

108
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,539  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:482 Y2:523
China patterns!

109
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,058  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
This is easy. "Can't do this...."

110
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,092  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow, seriously. Can't do this.

111
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,255  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey, Joe.
-Hey.

112
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,533  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Listen, I need to ask you a favor, and
we can't tell Monica anything about it.

113
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,018  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I thought you guys didn't have secrets.
-That will remain the official party line.

114
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,016  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:523
Look, Monica and I are having
a little financial trouble.

115
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,808  X1:075 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah, I know.
-What? What do you mean, you "know"?

116
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,091  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just figured it out, you know?

117
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,617  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, you're not working,
and the economy is bad.

118
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,174  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, right.

119
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,531  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:523
That is the fastest I have ever thought.

120
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,215  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
Anyway...

121
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,210  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I need to borrow some money.

122
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,014  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, sure. Yeah, how much?
Two thousand dollars?

123
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,059  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yes, $2000 exactly.
How did you know that?

124
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,616  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know how much you used to make,
and I know how much your rent is.

125
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,411  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, okay.

126
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,810  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am on fire.

127
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,932  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Listen, this is really nice.

128
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,178  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:523
Did you write a check to Monica
for $2000?

129
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,898  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
Did Monica borrow money from you?

130
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,340  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Kind of.
-I can't believe her.

131
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,536  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
Did she tell you we were having
money problems?

132
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,538  X1:148 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, no, no. It wasn't because
of your money problems.

133
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,612  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
It was for something for her.

134
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,412  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

135
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,649  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
Something personal.

136
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,733  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:523
What would she get for $2000
that she wouldn't tell me about?

137
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,094  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse me.

138
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,777  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:523
Boob job.

139
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,934  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't want her to get a boob job.
That's crazy.

140
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,898  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, it's not that crazy, okay?

141
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,450  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
Making them smaller,
that would be crazy.

142
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,212  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you
about Monica's little "groomie" joke.

143
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,129  X1:079 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, I think the reason people laughed
is that it's a play on the word "roomie."

144
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,336  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.

145
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,049  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, the thing I want to say is....

146
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,808  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:523
Maybe we should've
talked about this before.

147
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,053  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Us living together,
you're not expecting a proposal, right?

148
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,933  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, no, no. Not at all.
-Okay.

149
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,416  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
We're just moving in right now.
We'll see where it goes.

150
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,814  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
For me, it's as far as it can ever go.

151
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,931  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:523
-What do you mean?
-Look, Phoebe, I....

152
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,332  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
I love you very much.
But I never want to get married again.

153
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,694  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Wow.
-lt's just, my first marriage was...

154
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,012  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:523
...you know, such a disaster that
I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.

155
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,375  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Was it that bad?
-At one point, near the end...

156
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,692  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...she deliberately defecated on my--
-Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.

157
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,053  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:442 Y2:523
But don't you think it might be
different with someone else? Perhaps...

158
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,814  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:523
...a blond who always
uses the toilet?

159
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,330  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
Except for once in the ocean.

160
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,015  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, it's not about who I would marry.

161
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,570  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was certain the first time I got married
it'd last forever. I was wrong.

162
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,340  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
-But, it just--
-Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.

163
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,695  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just never want to get married again.

164
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,218  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,098  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are you okay with that? If not, maybe
us moving in together isn't the best idea.

166
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,618  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:442 Y2:523
No. Oh, I definitely don't
want to get married.

167
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,489  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't want to, too.

168
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,459  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because if we move in
and you start changing your mind...

169
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,451  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:444 Y2:523
...there is gonna be
hell to pay, mister.

170
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,939  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Trust me. I will never--
-Yeah, I get that. Yeah.

171
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,338  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hi. So you gave in
and decided to call someone?

172
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,658  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah. I don't know who I was kidding.
I can barely use chopsticks.

173
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,734  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You're all set.
-Oh, thank you so much.

174
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,135  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wait. You forgot your...

175
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,609  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
...game.

176
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,293  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

177
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,256  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, Rach. There she is,
my perfectly proportioned wife.

178
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,938  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:442 Y2:523
Don't look at me.
I never get his jokes.

179
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,096  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Thank you?
-No, no. Don't thank me.

180
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,048  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thank you. Do you know there is not
one thing I would change about you?

181
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,377  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:523
Not one single thing.
And definitely not...

182
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,815  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:523
...two single things.

183
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,971  X1:086 X2:634 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay, you're being weird. Do you want
sex, or did you do something bad?

184
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,655  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
No. No. No. I just love
the way you look. I am warm...

185
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,493  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:523
...for your form.

186
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,177  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, you know the old classics like,
you know, "You look nice"?

187
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,409  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:523
They're still okay.

188
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,857  X1:082 X2:634 Y1:442 Y2:523
But "you look nice" could mean
that I'm saying, "Your face looks nice."

189
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,488  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
I want to compliment your body.

190
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,898  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.

191
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,655  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:442 Y2:523
And more specifically, I wouldn't
want anything to get any bigger.

192
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,254  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Okay.
-I mean...

193
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,412  X1:105 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
...you wouldn't want any part of me
to get any bigger, would you?

194
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,535  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:486 Y2:523
Don't answer that.

195
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,578  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just when you thought that dude
couldn't get any weirder.

196
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,333  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why do you think he was so worried
about me getting bigger?

197
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,612  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know.
I mean, what brought that on?

198
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,533  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God. You know what,
we're trying to get pregnant...

199
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,897  X1:085 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
...so he's probably starting to freak out
that my body's gonna change.

200
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,415  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You think that's what it is?
-You heard him.

201
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,418  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:442 Y2:523
"No bigger. You're perfect.
Just don't get any bigger."

202
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,812  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
My God, he sounded just like
my high-school wrestling coach.

203
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,132  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
-Yeah. If you don't, I will.

204
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,895  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
Of course your body's gonna change.
Your breasts are gonna get bigger...

205
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,290  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
...your ass is gonna get bigger...

206
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,258  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
...you're gonna lose bladder control.

207
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,009  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
God, it's just such a magical time.

208
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,457  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hi. Listen, I wanted to ask you
something about marriage.

209
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,457  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:442 Y2:523
Now you're seeking me out
to make jokes?

210
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,408  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, I can see if we're all hanging
out, but to come to my home....

211
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,929  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I really want to know
how you feel about it.

212
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,649  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Why?
-Mike doesn't ever want to get married.

213
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,217  X1:296 X2:424 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Never?
-Never.

214
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,531  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:523
Wow. Are you still gonna
move in with him?

215
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,257  X1:078 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
I want to, but I wanted you to tell me
that marriage really isn't that big a deal.

216
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,652  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, that I won't be missing out
on anything. That marriage stinks.

217
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,260  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, marriage stinks.

218
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,298  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, if you want to see a man gain
weight and a woman stop shaving...

219
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,054  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:523
...get them married.

220
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,212  X1:101 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
-That's not how you really feel, is it?
-No, I'm sorry.

221
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,731  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
I know it's not what you want to hear,
but I can't help it. I love marriage.

222
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,056  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:523
Seriously, you?
"Divorce-o"?

223
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,850  X1:079 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
If you have to call me a name, I'd prefer
"Ross, the Divorcer." It's just cooler.

224
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,888  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look, I know my marriages
didn't exactly work out...

225
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,097  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but, you know, I loved being
that committed to another person.

226
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,975  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:523
And Carol and I had some good times
before she became a lesbian.

227
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,779  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:488 Y2:523
And once afterward.

228
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,170  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:523
Anyway, I'm sorry.

229
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,652  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's okay. That's how you feel.

230
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,654  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
But, come on, I mean,
living together will be great.

231
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,539  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, you guys have so much fun.
And you love Mike.

232
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,290  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:446 Y2:523
-I do love Mike.
-Yeah, see?

233
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,651  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
And you were so excited about
moving in together before...

234
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,209  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and you know what, you should be.
It's a big deal.

235
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,815  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, I guess you're right.

236
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,050  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.

237
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,694  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Divorcer to the rescue.

238
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,332  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:442 Y2:523
-It's not cooler.
-Yeah, I just heard it.

239
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,539  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rach?

240
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,128  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rachel?!

241
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,211  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
So I can't do anything I like?!

242
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,055  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Rach.

243
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,815  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
Perfection.
Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.

244
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,969  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Honey?
-Yeah?

245
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,335  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:523
About that.

246
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,492  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm going to change.
-Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.

247
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,691  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm gonna get bigger.

248
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,219  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, I....

249
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,258  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love your breasts the way they are.

250
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,015  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fascist.

251
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,492  X1:133 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
My breasts are gonna get bigger
whether you like it or not.

252
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,010  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
And it's not just my breasts.
My ass is gonna get bigger too.

253
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,654  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your ass?!

254
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,490  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
And don't be surprised if her hands
and her feet get bigger too.

255
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,970  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
-They do that?
-lt's kind of a package deal.

256
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,491  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
God, why? Why would you want to
do that to yourself?

257
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,294  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:523
I thought it was something
that we both wanted.

258
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,295  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
If it means that much to you, I may be
able to get onboard with the boobs...

259
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,009  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but the giant ass
and the big clown feet?

260
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,618  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, Chandler.

261
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,738  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
If you can't handle this,
what will you be like in the hospital...

262
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,939  X1:082 X2:639 Y1:444 Y2:523
...with the blood and screaming and the
little person that's shooting out of her?

263
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,019  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

264
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,449  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, why did you tell Chandler
that Monica was getting a boob job?

265
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,209  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because she is.

266
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,055  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
-For your boob job.

267
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,979  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Joe....
-It's over.

268
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,095  X1:086 X2:634 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay, so I'm out $4000 and
nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?

269
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,691  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:523
Hey. Hey, what do you guys think
about this: Ross, the Divorce Force.

270
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,612  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Better.
-Yeah?

271
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,737  X1:277 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:523
Very cool.

272
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,975  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hey, Pheebs? You know, I'm really glad
you came to talk to me the other day...

273
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,052  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...and I hope I was a little helpful.
-Yeah, you were helpful.

274
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,938  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Yeah. No, thank you.
-Good. Good.

275
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,337  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
Because the more I thought about it,
the more I realized...

276
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,015  X1:097 X2:624 Y1:442 Y2:523
...I don't think marriage is necessarily
the right path for you.

277
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,369  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:523
What do you mean?

278
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,531  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:523
I know the other day
in the coffeehouse...

279
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,692  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
...you were all caught up
in the whole soccer-mom thing...

280
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,899  X1:077 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but is that really you? I mean, can you
honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?

281
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,653  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
They are awfully boxy.

282
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,452  X1:079 X2:640 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored
with marriage. I mean, it's so normal.

283
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,613  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

284
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,293  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, can I help?

285
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,896  X1:069 X2:648 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,
maneuvered a narrow hallway...

286
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,212  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
...dodged a rabid pit bull. But these last
three feet are where it gets really tricky.

287
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,248  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, sometimes your words,
they hurt.

288
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,849  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, where do you guys want this?

289
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,534  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, seriously,
because this is really heavy.

290
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,932  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, not for me, because I'm only
pretending to hold it, but for these guys.

291
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,292  X1:074 X2:642 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just one last time on the marriage thing.
There's no wiggle room? None at all?

292
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,489  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, but you don't want to
get married either, right?

293
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,849  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:482 Y2:523
Right.

294
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,295  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
Except that I do want to get married.

295
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,492  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:523
Couldn't have had this conversation
down at the truck, huh?

296
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,252  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? You want to get married?

297
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,014  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:523
Someday.

298
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,371  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:488 Y2:523
And...hernia.

299
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:43,497  X1:087 X2:634 Y1:442 Y2:523
I haven't had a normal life. And I never
felt like I was missing out on anything.

300
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,892  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:442 Y2:523
But it feels like now it's my turn
to have some of the regular stuff.

301
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,335  X1:091 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why didn't you say something before?

302
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,931  X1:072 X2:647 Y1:442 Y2:523
I didn't know how much I wanted it. And
I love you, and I wanted to live with you.

303
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,455  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:523
I want to live with you too.
I mean, let's do that.

304
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,651  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:486 Y2:523
But I don't think I can.

305
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,574  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
It was okay to move in when
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

306
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,130  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:442 Y2:523
But I can't move in knowing nothing
is ever gonna happen.

307
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,697  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:444 Y2:523
Can we at least try living together? You
might change your mind about marriage.

308
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,738  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you gonna change yours?

309
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,291  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

310
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,928  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Me neither.

311
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,337  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:523
I think I need to be with someone
who wants what I want.

312
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,378  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:486 Y2:523
But I don't want this to end.

313
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,379  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I don't want it to end either.

314
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,332  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't believe this is gonna end.

315
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,010  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
I guess I'll have my stuff picked up.

316
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,811  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah. Okay.

317
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,012  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, so....

318
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,616  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:523
Goodbye.

319
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,375  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Take it easy, Mike.
-Bye, Mike.

320
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,699  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm so sorry, Pheebs.

321
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,454  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're all sorry.

322
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:31,134  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look on the bright side. At least you
won't have to live with this ugly chair.

323
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,539  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
That was here already, huh?

324
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,055  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you.

325
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,134  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:054 Y2:089
I did it! I did it!

326
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,178  X1:287 X2:429 Y1:054 Y2:094
All right.

327
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,331  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:054 Y2:095
I'd better take all I can carry.

328
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,694  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:054 Y2:134
Who knows when I'll be able
to get in here again, huh?

329
