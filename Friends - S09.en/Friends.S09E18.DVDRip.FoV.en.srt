1
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:10,014
Monica?
Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?

2
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,853
-Okay.
-All right!

3
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:14,296
But what is it not?

4
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:17,779
A place to entertain my lady friends.

5
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:22,653
-And what else is it not?
-A place to eat spaghetti.

6
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,337
Very good. What do you need
it for anyway?

7
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,896
The Powerball lottery
is up to 300 million...

8
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:32,379
-...and they don't sell tickets here.
-So you're driving up to Connecticut?

9
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,613
Yeah, Connecticut.
Not West Virginia.

10
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:40,258
Maybe I'll drive you up there.
I'd like to buy some tickets myself.

11
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:44,660
Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid,
we could really use $300 million.

12
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:49,531
Yes, because if I was at my old job,
we'd say, "300 million? No, thank you."

13
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,292
-Will you get me tickets too?
-Yeah, me too.

14
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:55,099
-Sure.
-I have an idea.

15
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:58,378
Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks,
we'll pool our money together...

16
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,090
-...and then if we win, we'll split it.
-That's a great idea!

17
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:04,851
No, thanks.

18
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,736
-You don't want to win the lottery?
-Sure I do.

19
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,857
I also want to be king
of my own country...

20
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:12,654
...and find out what happened
to Amelia Earhart.

21
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:16,258
-Still on Amelia Earhart?
-The woman just vanished!

22
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:19,619
Seriously, you don't want in on this?

23
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:22,619
No. Do you know what your odds
are of winning the lottery?

24
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:26,251
I mean, you have a better chance
of being struck by lightning 42 times.

25
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,498
But there's six of us, so we'd
only have to get struck 7 times.

26
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:31,771
I like those odds!

27
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:36,295
Seriously, you guys, I can't believe
you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.

28
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:39,578
I mean, that's such a bunch
of boo-hockey.

29
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:44,612
I'll ask.

30
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:46,774
"Boo-hockey"?

31
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,771
Oh, we think Emma's about
to start talking...

32
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:53,411
...so we're trying to be careful about
what words we use in front of her.

33
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:55,691
So get ready to hear a lot
of boo-hockey...

34
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:58,329
...gosh darn it
and brother pucker.

35
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:01,818
How do you know
she's gonna start talking?

36
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,730
When I talk to her, I almost feel
like she understands what I'm saying.

37
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:07,658
Kind of like Joey.

38
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:10,737
What's that now?

39
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:13,932
The One With the Lottery

40
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:05,091
God, look at all these tickets.
It's so exciting.

41
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,178
I haven't won anything
since sixth grade.

42
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:09,576
Pie-eating contest?

43
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:14,697
You assume because I was heavy that's
the only way I could win something?

44
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,779
No, I saw a picture
of you covered in blueberries.

45
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,700
-That was a good day.
-Yeah.

46
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:25,049
-They're towing your car!
-I'm parked in a garage on Morton.

47
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:28,329
They're towing a car.

48
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:32,050
And I am seeing spots.

49
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,821
Ross, you don't have Emma!
Rachel, you don't have Emma!

50
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,290
-Where's Emma? Who has Emma?
-Joey, relax.

51
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:41,579
My mother picked her up two hours ago.
You were there.

52
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,214
-I was?
-Yes, and you talked to her.

53
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,579
-I did?
-She dropped off a casserole.

54
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:51,614
Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.

55
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,096
Did you come by to watch
us win the big bucks?

56
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,737
Yeah. And then I figured after you win,
we can all go out to the balcony...

57
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:02,139
...and see a night rainbow
with gremlins dancing on top of it.

58
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,456
Don't touch the phone!
I'll get it!

59
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:08,415
-You think he washed his hands?
-Hello?

60
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,851
-Hey, Charlie, what do you know?
-What's going on?

61
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:14,178
Chandler's supposed to find out if he's
getting a job at his agency.

62
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,610
But out of 15 interns,
they're only hiring three.

63
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,539
-Tough odds.
-Yeah.

64
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:22,336
If only it were a sure thing
like your 24-state lottery.

65
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:26,970
Yeah, look who's coming around!

66
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:30,730
Damn it. All right, call me
when you know more.

67
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,774
-Did you get it?
-One of the slots got filled.

68
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:39,493
-By you?
-Sense the tone.

69
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:44,131
-No, that kid Nate got it.
-Oh, I hate that guy.

70
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:47,418
I mean, come on, kid,
pull up your pants!

71
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:49,378
Well, there's two spots left, right?

72
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,095
Yeah. I mean, I want this so much.
I want to get one.

73
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:54,377
I want my friend Charlie
to get one.

74
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,532
Except I don't care about Charlie.

75
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,376
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey!

76
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,180
You are not gonna believe this.
I just saw my psychic...

77
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:06,050
...and she said I was definitely
gonna win the lottery tonight!

78
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:09,372
I thought we could use
some extra luck...

79
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,497
...so I brought a wishbone home
from work.

80
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:17,890
A psychic and a wishbone?
Guys, give someone else a chance.

81
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:20,337
-All right, who wants to do it?
-Can I?

82
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,374
Vegetarians never get
to do the wishbone.

83
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,294
It's really not fair. Just because
we don't eat the meat...

84
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:29,379
...doesn't mean we don't like
to play with the carcasses.

85
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,619
All right. Rach?

86
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:34,096
I don't want that turkey smell
all over my hands.

87
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,691
I'll do it! lt'll get the casserole
stink off of mine.

88
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,575
-I hope I win.
-Well, it doesn't really matter.

89
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,618
You're both wishing
for the same thing.

90
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:49,372
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for,
or else, you know, it won't come true.

91
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:52,499
Right. But we know
what you're wishing for.

92
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:55,534
-I can't really say.
-I understand.

93
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:58,135
But you're wishing
for what we think, aren't you?

94
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:00,980
I'm not really comfortable
with these questions!

95
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,132
-Please!
-Just do it!

96
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:05,218
Okay. One, two, three.

97
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,212
I won! Hey!

98
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:10,373
You know what? I'm sure your
wish is gonna come true.

99
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:15,217
But, you guys, just in case, maybe a
genie will come out if we rub this lamp.

100
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,417
That thing gets hot!

101
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:20,173
Ross, just keep making your jokes.

102
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:22,457
How are you gonna feel
if we actually do win?

103
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:25,698
-You're not gonna win.
-I know the odds are against us...

104
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:29,854
...but somebody has to win, and it could
be us. And then how you gonna feel?

105
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,616
We're gonna be like, "Everybody, let's
take our helicopters up to the Cape."

106
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:36,056
And you're gonna be all,
like, "Oh, I can't, guys.

107
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:39,293
I'll have to meet you up there.
I gotta gas up the Hyundai."

108
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:47,140
Okay, I've heard myself on tape,
and I sound nothing like that.

109
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,415
I can see the headline now:
"Lottery Winners' Friend...

110
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,850
...Filled With Regret,
Eats Own Arm."

111
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,940
Why would I eat my own arm?

112
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:58,577
Well, you wouldn't, but we own the
paper. We can print whatever we want.

113
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:01,255
You know what? I'm gonna
throw in 50 bucks for you.

114
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,778
-Why?
-Because I know that you think...

115
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,859
...that the lottery is boo-hockey...

116
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:10,611
...but we're all here, and we're gonna
watch the numbers and have fun.

117
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:14,615
And you're my brother,
and I want you to be a part of this.

118
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:18,850
You don't have to do that.
I mean, I'll pay for myself.

119
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,775
But just the fact that you want me to
have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.

120
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,459
Come here.

121
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,816
Get a room.

122
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:33,581
So now that you're in,
what are you gonna do if we win?

123
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:38,218
-I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.
-Calm down.

124
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,054
Seriously, that's your fantasy?
To invest it?

125
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:45,777
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, "invest it"?
I meant, "Be cool and piss it all away."

126
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:51,451
I know! We should pool all
our money and buy the Knicks!

127
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:53,578
I don't really care about the Knicks.

128
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:56,579
You will when I pick you
as starting forward.

129
00:07:56,981 --> 00:08:00,815
You would do that?
I never get picked!

130
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,258
I'm not sure a sports team
is the way to go.

131
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:06,572
You won't let me buy the Knicks?
I can't believe you're taking this away.

132
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:10,689
You're right, it has been your dream
for over 15 seconds.

133
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:14,771
How long until they announce
the numbers, Mommy?

134
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,140
I'll take this one too.
"Mommy"?

135
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:22,215
Oh, I've gotten into the habit
of calling Rachel...

136
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:24,372
..."Mommy" when we're around Emma.

137
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:28,250
Which I now realize we are not.

138
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,617
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough,
it'll be her first word.

139
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:36,814
Although if we're gonna do that,
we should probably call me "Daddy" too.

140
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:39,690
I like that, Daddy.

141
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:46,014
I was just talking about Rachel.

142
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,974
Is Daddy getting angry?

143
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,341
Is Daddy gonna spank me?

144
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,331
Well, that depends.

145
00:08:57,501 --> 00:09:00,140
Have you been a bad--?
No, I can't.

146
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:07,500
Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.
Did anybody else hear?

147
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:10,895
What? Susan got it? How?

148
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:14,053
Oh, man, I would've slept with him!

149
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:16,737
All right, bye.

150
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:19,815
Dude, I'm sorry.
But hey, there's one spot left, right?

151
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,575
-Well, Charlie's gonna get that.
-Hey, don't say that.

152
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:25,301
You've got just as good a chance
of getting that job.

153
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,093
He is the boss' son.

154
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:30,055
-Come on, lottery!
-Yeah!

155
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,815
-It starts in, like, 20 minutes.
-Okay, here we go.

156
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:36,212
We need to sort through the tickets
quickly to see if we've won.

157
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,975
So does anybody have any ideas
how to organize this?

158
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:41,211
Okay, how about this:

159
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,937
We divide them
into six groups of 40.

160
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:47,013
The remaining 10 can be read
by whoever finishes first.

161
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,860
-I have another idea.
-I'm sorry, idea time is over.

162
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:54,216
-Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
-Yeah.

163
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,731
-What about the ones on the nightstand?
-There are no tickets there.

164
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:00,580
Yes, there are.
I just saw them a few minutes ago.

165
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:04,014
No, you didn't.
You must be mistaken.

166
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:07,810
-There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
-Chandler, sense the tone.

167
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:13,460
Well, well, well.
Look what Mommy found.

168
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,612
Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra
tickets for me and Chandler.

169
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:21,379
The psychic also said that
I would be betrayed.

170
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:25,774
I can't believe this.
I thought we were all in this together.

171
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:29,178
-Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
-Three minutes ago!

172
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,775
I don't know why that's important.

173
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:35,940
I was with you the whole time.
When did you even get those?

174
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:40,453
When you were reading the dirty
magazines without taking off the plastic.

175
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:42,453
I'll show you how.

176
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,532
Okay. Well, Monica, suppose one
of your special tickets wins?

177
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:49,420
How are you gonna feel when you win
and lose your friends?

178
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:53,250
Please. If I win the lottery,
you guys are not gonna leave me.

179
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:57,414
Someone gave me muffins last week, and
I couldn't get rid of you for three days!

180
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:01,533
Chandler, would you just tell her
what she did was wrong?

181
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,494
She's right. You shouldn't have
bought tickets just for us.

182
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:06,259
Let me finish.

183
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,981
However, it doesn't look like
I'm gonna get this job...

184
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,253
...so I can't afford to have principles.
So screw you! The tickets are ours!

185
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:16,649
There's the man I married.

186
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:19,096
All right. Believe me,
if you win the lottery...

187
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,172
...it's the last you're gonna hear
from us.

188
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:25,897
Fine. Don't be my friends.
I'll buy new friends.

189
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:30,851
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic
surgery so they look just like you!

190
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,581
You know what?
I want my share of the tickets.

191
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:36,090
I want my tickets too!
And I'm buying the Knicks!

192
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,616
And Steffi Graf !

193
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,056
Cool. Then I want mine too!
And if I win...

194
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:44,258
...l'm gonna put it all
into a very low-yield bond!

195
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:48,613
No. You guys, we gotta keep
all the tickets together.

196
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:50,737
No. No, we should divide them up...

197
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:53,210
...and I should get extra because
we used my car!

198
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,015
Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,
it should be me!

199
00:11:56,181 --> 00:12:00,618
-This whole thing was my idea!
-Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!

200
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,016
Just give them to me,
and I'll split them up!

201
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:08,257
Hey, hey!

202
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:11,813
God, I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting an end to this!

203
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:15,218
-Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!
-Wait, no, no! Hey!

204
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:19,819
If we're not doing this together,
we're not doing it at all.

205
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:22,211
-Say goodbye to your tickets.
-No! No! No!

206
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,889
Do not come any closer!

207
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:28,610
Can I come a little bit closer?
Valuable things are getting squished.

208
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:31,381
Now, what's more important,
your friends or money?

209
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:33,856
-Friends!
-Money!

210
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:38,540
Friends.

211
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:41,690
Hey, Monica,
what about your extra tickets?

212
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:43,812
They're all in there.

213
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,738
-Even these five that I hid in my bra.
-Monica!

214
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,620
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.

215
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,500
There is no way I was
gonna dump this--

216
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:55,891
God! No!

217
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:01,301
I think I broke your bowl.

218
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,141
Go! Go! Go!

219
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:21,773
What a beautiful night to be running
around the street, looking for tickets.

220
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,617
And the wind sure made it fun.

221
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,730
-Phoebe, we lost half of them.
-So what?

222
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,971
Monica, we have the winning ticket.

223
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:33,451
My psychic said I was
gonna win, remember?

224
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:37,978
Weird your psychic didn't mention
anything about the scary pigeon.

225
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:42,131
As a matter of fact, she said
that's how I'm going to die.

226
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:46,419
So excuse me
for being a little skittish.

227
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:48,651
There's two messages.
This could be from work.

228
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:52,370
-Oh, play them.
-Okay. Here we go.

229
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:58,978
Hello. This is the pigeon from
the balcony calling to apologize.

230
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:04,654
I shouldn't have knocked the tickets
out of the pretty lady's hand.

231
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:09,658
It was all my fault.
Not hers. Bye.

232
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,293
Well, I bet that was very hard
for him to do.

233
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:21,893
Hey, Chandler, it's Charlie.

234
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,858
This is it.

235
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:28,014
Listen, it turns
out I got the last spot.

236
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:30,900
I'm really sorry, man.
It was a lot of fun working with you.

237
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:33,416
Give me a call if you want.

238
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,220
Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.

239
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:37,860
Sorry, Chandler.

240
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:42,731
It is so unfair. It's like that time they
promoted Saundra over me at work.

241
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:44,579
Was she related to Ralph Lauren?

242
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:48,296
No, she was just much better
at her job than me.

243
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,816
You guys, the drawing's
about to start.

244
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:53,330
We should call my mom's
and say good night to Emma...

245
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:55,417
-...before she goes down.
-Good idea.

246
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:58,574
Honey, you're being really strong
about this.

247
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:01,175
I know how badly you wanted that job.

248
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:04,054
Yeah, you know, I really
thought I deserved it.

249
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:09,415
But let's go win the lottery. I mean, we
still have a 130 chances to win, right?

250
00:15:10,981 --> 00:15:13,290
Hundred and thirty-one.

251
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,775
Yeah, good night, sweetheart.
I love you.

252
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:20,616
And remember,
you're Daddy's little girl.

253
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:23,659
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.

254
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:28,254
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.

255
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:30,332
Rach, they're announcing
the numbers!

256
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:34,371
My God, I can already feel
myself changing.

257
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:38,490
Here are your official Powerball
numbers. We have 53.

258
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,090
-I've got that.
-We have one too!

259
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:43,934
We are on the road, people!

260
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:46,210
Come on!

261
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:51,654
Mom, please, I know you love your new
lips, but I can barely understand you.

262
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:54,813
Would you please just let me
say good night to my daughter?

263
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,296
And here we go.
The Powerball is seven.

264
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:01,050
All right, check your numbers!
Make me rich.

265
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,372
You guys,
you're not gonna believe this.

266
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,772
I was just saying good night
to Emma, and she said her first words.

267
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:09,978
-What?
-Well, what did she say?

268
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:12,900
She said, "Gleba" !

269
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:18,731
Make me rich!

270
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:22,572
-Isn't that amazing?
-Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.

271
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,379
Why aren't you more excited?

272
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,650
Rach, gleba is not a word.

273
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:32,895
-Well, of course it is.
-Okay. What does it mean?

274
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:36,013
Well, I don't know all the words.

275
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,737
You know, I'm just glad I didn't
miss my daughter's first word.

276
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:44,053
-Yes you did! Gleba is a word!
-Okay. Use it in a sentence.

277
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:47,890
Okay. Emma just said, "Gleba."

278
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:54,655
-It's not a word.
-Okay, fine. I'm gonna look it up.

279
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:56,300
Okay, great.

280
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,459
While you're at it,
she said another word the other day.

281
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,577
Why don't you look up:

282
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:09,899
All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba.
Gleba. Gleba. Gleba!

283
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:15,255
Here it is! "The fleshy, spore-bearing
inner mass of a certain fungi."

284
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:23,251
She's gonna be a scientist.

285
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:32,655
-Damn it. Anybody got anything?
-No.

286
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:34,893
I'm still looking through mine.

287
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:38,138
Just double-checking.
No.

288
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:41,099
No. No.

289
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,697
No!

290
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:53,454
Hello? Hold on.

291
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:54,815
It's your boss.

292
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:57,449
The "I'm sorry I rejected you"
phone call.

293
00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:00,135
I'm not used to getting these
from guys.

294
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:03,530
-Hey, Steve.
-Chandler, hi.

295
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:06,499
I'm sure you've heard
we filled the three positions.

296
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:08,891
We felt that with your
maturity and experience...

297
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:11,416
...you wouldn't be happy
being someone's assistant.

298
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:14,135
I'd love to be somebody's
assistant. Answering phones...

299
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,013
...getting coffee,
I live for that stuff.

300
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:20,891
And I'm not too mature.
Farts, boobies, butt cracks!

301
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:26,012
Chandler, you were the strongest
person in the program.

302
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:29,491
We're offering you the position
of junior copywriter.

303
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:33,780
Me? That guy
who just said, "butt cracks"?

304
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:35,090
Yes, that's right.

305
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:37,576
We're excited about the level
of sophistication...

306
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,931
...you'll be bringing to the job.

307
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:44,816
Okay. Well, thanks, you won't regret it.
I'll see you tomorrow.

308
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:58,373
What?

309
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,180
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna
be a junior copywriter!

310
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:05,254
Congratulations!
Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.

311
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:07,935
Thanks. Does that mean
I get the good loving tonight?

312
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:11,776
You bet. No TV or anything.

313
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:15,618
-Hey, that is so great about the job.
-Thanks, man.

314
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,851
I'd like to think I had
something to do with it.

315
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:21,133
-Really? Why?
-Well, before with the wishbone.

316
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:26,819
I didn't wish we would win the lottery.
I wished you'd get the job.

317
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:29,217
Oh, yeah?

318
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:32,897
Listen, don't tell Monica.
She'll rip your heart right out.

319
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,850
Well, you know what?
There was a little part of me...

320
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:40,012
...that really thought
we were gonna win.

321
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:46,410
Me too. So much for my
dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.

322
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:50,811
You guys? What was the Powerball
number again?

323
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,449
-Seven.
-We won.

324
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,459
-What?
-We won!

325
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:58,215
-Let me see! Let me see!
-Don't tear it!

326
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:02,210
Phoebe, you don't have any
of the first five numbers!

327
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:09,257
I know that, but look, we got
the Powerball number. We won $3!

328
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:14,014
Wow, you think we should get that over
20 years or go for the big payout?

329
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:18,618
I don't care. I've never won
anything before. I can't believe this!

330
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,971
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do
with your $3?

331
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:25,254
Well, it's not all mine.
We all get 50 cents.

332
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:27,697
You know what?
You can have mine.

333
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,055
-Me too.
-Me too.

334
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:31,371
Me too.

335
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,734
Well, I guess if everybody else is.

336
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:50,894
Hey, guys. So I just called
the Powerball hot line.

337
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:56,136
-Can you believe it? Nobody won.
-I beg to differ.

338
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,051
Maybe nobody won the jackpot,
but there was this guy in here earlier...

339
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:05,931
...and he found a ticket on the street
right outside and won $10,000.

340
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:19,973
Again, don't blame the pretty lady.

341
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:25,096
It was not her fault.
It was me, the pigeon.

342
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:31,652
Seriously, stop staring at her.

343
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:43,410
