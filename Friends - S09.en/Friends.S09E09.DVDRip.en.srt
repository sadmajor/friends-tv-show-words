1
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:07,650  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:444 Y2:523
This kitty is Mittens.
This one is Fitzhugh.

2
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:10,611  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:523
And this little guy
in the cat condo is Jinkies.

3
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:15,891  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's a lot of cats, Jo Lynn.

4
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:17,122  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Single, are you?

5
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:20,922  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
Chandler Bing.

6
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:24,563  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
How come you're answering your own
phone? Where's your crazy assistant?

7
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,242  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's up, Joe?

8
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:31,489  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
What have we always wanted
to do together?

9
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:35,165  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:523
Braid each other's hair
and ride horseback on the beach?

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,642  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
No. No. No. When you get home
tomorrow night...

11
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:41,044  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
...you and I are gonna be
at the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside!

12
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:42,652  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Courtside? Oh, my God!
-Yeah!

13
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:46,482  X1:078 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for
the ball and break my jaw with his knee!

14
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,883  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:486 Y2:523
That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.

15
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,852  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hello?
-Joey just called.

16
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,925  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:442 Y2:523
He's got courtside Knicks tickets
for him and me tomorrow night.

17
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,364  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
But tomorrow night's the only night
I get off from the restaurant.

18
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,001  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:442 Y2:523
If you go, we won't have
a night together for a week.

19
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:07,246  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:442 Y2:523
But honey, it's courtside!
The cheerleaders will be right in--

20
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:10,162  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's not the way to convince you.

21
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,403  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't wanna be one
of those wives that says:

22
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,371  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
"You can't go to the game.
You have to spend time with me."

23
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,808  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
So if you could just realize
it on your own....

24
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:21,845  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:442 Y2:523
I know. You're right.
I wanna see you too.

25
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:25,050  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.
He's looking forward to it.

26
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:27,602  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
Tell him you haven't seen
your wife in a long time.

27
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:31,488  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
Tell him that having a long-distance
relationship is really difficult.

28
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:35,612  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
Tell him that what little time
we have together is precious.

29
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,332  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll think of something.

30
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,969  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:486 Y2:523
The One With Rachel's Phone Number

31
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:25,121  X1:266 X2:448 Y1:054 Y2:089
You look....

32
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:30,252  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:054 Y2:129
I mean, it's just....
That dress....

33
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:33,247  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:054 Y2:133
Well, I hope the ends
of these sentences are good.

34
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:36,485  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:054 Y2:134
They're good. It's just been a while
since I've seen you like this.

35
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,564  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:054 Y2:094
You clean up good.

36
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,682  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really? Well, thank you.

37
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,530  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:054 Y2:094
Okay, stop looking at me like that.

38
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:50,486  X1:074 X2:642 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Last time that happened, that happened.
-Right, right.

39
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:59,562  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:054 Y2:133
So are you excited about
your first night away from Emma?

40
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,122  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I
are gonna have so much fun.

41
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:05,091  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:054 Y2:128
-Thank you for watching the baby.
-It's fine.

42
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,289  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:054 Y2:094
Actually, I invited Mike over.

43
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,442  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:054 Y2:129
-Phoebe's Mike?
-Yeah.

44
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,644  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I didn't know you hung out.
-We don't...

45
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:12,571  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:054 Y2:095
...but I'd like to get to know him.

46
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,566  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:054 Y2:130
Maybe have a little dinner,
drinks, conversation.

47
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:18,367  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:054 Y2:129
That's so cute.
Ross and Mike's first date.

48
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:22,807  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Will that be awkward?
What are you gonna talk about?

49
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:26,164  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know. But you know, we have
a lot in common, you know?

50
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,245  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
He plays piano.
I played keyboards in college.

51
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:34,369  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:442 Y2:523
He's been divorced.
I have some experience in that area.

52
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:38,569  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Yeah?
-Hi!

53
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,166  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
Girl's night out indeed.

54
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,688  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
So I think Emma is probably
down for the night...

55
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,969  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:523
-...but if you need anything--
-We'll be fine.

56
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,964  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You go have fun.
-Okay, you too.

57
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,408  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Thanks.
-And I hope you score.

58
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,042  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

59
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:58,681  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:486 Y2:523
So, welcome.

60
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:02,484  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I got beer.
-I got bottled breast milk.

61
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,126  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Why don't we start with the beer.
-Okay.

62
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:14,724  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So Phoebe tells me you play piano.
-Yeah.

63
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:17,566  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, I used to play keyboards
in college.

64
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,372  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do you have one here?

65
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,446  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

66
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,449  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

67
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:45,328  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:523
You know, I'm divorced.

68
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,567  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:523
Phoebe-- Phoebe says you're--
You've been divorced?

69
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,849  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:53,806  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't really like
to talk about it.

71
00:04:57,053 --> 00:05:00,443  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's okay. We'll talk about
something else.

72
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,288  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So you're a paleontologist, right?
-Yeah.

73
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,364  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
My cousin's a paleontologist.

74
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:21,852  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, he and I would probably have
a lot to talk about.

75
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,288  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Welcome home.
-Well, look at you.

76
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:31,045  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah. What do you think?

77
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:33,364  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, it looks great. It's just--

78
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,684  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:523
I'm wearing the same thing
underneath, so....

79
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,248  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:488 Y2:523
You see what I mean?

80
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,683  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey! How come your door's locked?

81
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:45,730  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Just a second!
-No, no, no!

82
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,485  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Joey can't know I'm here.
-Why not?

83
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:49,962  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:442 Y2:523
I didn't want to say
I couldn't go to the game...

84
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:53,205  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
-So you lied to him?

85
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:57,042  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's always better to lie than to have
the complicated discussion.

86
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:00,245  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
Except with you.

87
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:05,049  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, open the door! What's going on?

88
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:09,966  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What are you--?
-Hi.

89
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,647  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why are you dressed like that?

90
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:16,206  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:442 Y2:523
Because Chandler's gonna be home
in a couple of days...

91
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:20,048  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
...so I thought I would just, you know,
practice the art of seduction.

92
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:22,284  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:523
I thought I heard a man's voice before.

93
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:25,092  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, I was just doing Chandler's side
of the conversation.

94
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,483  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:523
You know, like, "Hi, how do I look?"

95
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:31,771  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:523
"Really sexy. Could I be any more
turned on?" You know?

96
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,971  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Wait a minute.

97
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,010  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:523
Why are there two glasses
of wine out?

98
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,444  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because one of them is for you!

99
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:45,526  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.

100
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:51,729  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, it's funny. I've been
practicing the art of seduction myself.

101
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,364  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You might wanna keep practicing.
-Yeah.

102
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,086  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:448 Y2:523
-It's Joey.
-What?

103
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:04,131  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Hey, Joe.
-Dude, come home!

104
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:09,168  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What? Why?
-Come home!

105
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:11,125  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, I can't. What's going on?

106
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,962  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I think Monica's cheating on you!

107
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,966  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
I told you, you shouldn't have married
someone hotter than you!

108
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:23,288  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:442 Y2:523
If you can't deal with this,
then I'm gonna.

109
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,723  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No!
-I just heard him!

110
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,487  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can you hear him now?

111
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,849  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
No. All right, I'm going in.

112
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,566  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No, wait!
-I heard him again!

113
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,083  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, just stay there.
I'm coming home.

114
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:42,726  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll see you when you get here.

115
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:45,043  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'll wait out in the hall
in case he comes out.

116
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,566  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Is that really necessary?
-Absolutely. You'd do it for me.

117
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:53,170  X1:075 X2:641 Y1:444 Y2:523
Not that you ever have to, because
I know how to keep my women satisfied.

118
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,563  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?

119
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:12,126  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, they said 30 minutes or less.
Well, how long has it been?

120
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:15,528  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:523
Eleven minutes.

121
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,722  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
And now 12.

122
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:30,692  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So you like the beer?
-I do. I do.

123
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:34,448  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
Although, it's actually a lager.

124
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,409  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:442 Y2:523
What's the difference
between beer and lager?

125
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:42,047  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't know.

126
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:44,847  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
We could look it up.

127
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:49,850  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
Things are about to get wild.

128
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:57,487  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, God, remember the girls' nights
we used to have...

129
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,689  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
...sitting around talking
about you and Ross?

130
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:02,162  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, God! It seems like forever ago.

131
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,322  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know.

132
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:06,962  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:442 Y2:523
So, what's going on
with you and Ross?

133
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:12,568  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I don't know. I mean,
for a long time, nothing.

134
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:16,362  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
But you know, actually,
right before you picked me up...

135
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,967  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
...Ross and I had a little thing.

136
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:22,006  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God! I love things!
What happened?

137
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:25,364  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, first he told me
he liked how I looked.

138
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:29,242  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:488 Y2:523
And then we had a little...

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,483  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:523
...eye contact.

140
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,002  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:523
Eye contact?

141
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:36,885  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
I hope you were using protection.

142
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:44,251  X1:076 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
Excuse me, these are from
the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

143
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:48,089  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
Should we send them something back?
Let's send them mashed potatoes!

144
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:49,567  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, wait! Don't do that!

145
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,644  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:442 Y2:523
That'll make them think
they can come over.

146
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:53,081  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, what if they do?

147
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:58,492  X1:085 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
We're not here to meet guys. You have
a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.

148
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:03,041  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.

149
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:07,092  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, not everything has to go
as far as eye contact.

150
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,573  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
Chandler, you have to tell Joey
you're not in Tulsa.

151
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:14,367  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:442 Y2:523
Isn't it better for him
to think you're cheating on me...

152
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:17,252  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
...than for him to think
I'm cheating on him?

153
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:19,171  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
I heard it.

154
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,008  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't want him to think
I'm having an affair.

155
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:25,327  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:442 Y2:523
All right, I've got a plan.
I'll go down the fire escape--

156
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,570  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because all good plans start with,
"I'll go down the fire escape."

157
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:30,092  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hear me out, woman!

158
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:33,804  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll go down the fire escape and wait.

159
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:36,402  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
Then it'll be like I just got back
from Tulsa.

160
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:39,451  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey and I will come in
and see that there's no guy in here.

161
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,929  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:442 Y2:523
Aren't you afraid that Joey's
gonna figure all this out?

162
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:47,532  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
I heard it.

163
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,009  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm gonna wait.
-The scary pigeon's back?

164
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,204  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's huge.

165
00:11:31,213 --> 00:11:34,922  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't believe you live in that building.
My grandmother lives in that building!

166
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:37,402  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ida Greene? No sense
of personal space...

167
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,962  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
...kind of smells like chicken,
looks like a potato.

168
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:42,767  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:442 Y2:523
-"Spuds" is your grandmother?
-That's my bubbe!

169
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,766  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:442 Y2:523
So we're on our way
to a couple of parties.

170
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:52,084  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe we could get your numbers
and call if we find something fun?

171
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:55,970  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't really
looking for anything to happen...

172
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,567  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
...with you guys. I have a boyfriend.

173
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:00,809  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:444 Y2:523
-All right.
-It's no big deal.

174
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:07,045  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
So she has a boyfriend.
What is your situation?

175
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,843  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, it's complicated.
I don't actually have a boyfriend, but--

176
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:13,442  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
Then can I have your number?

177
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:15,691  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry, no.

178
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,168  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

179
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,848  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, sure!

180
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:24,330  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, my God, you're giving
your real number!

181
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:28,288  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay, thanks. I'll give you
a call later tonight.

182
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,290  X1:299 X2:416 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Great.
-Bye.

183
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:31,647  X1:316 X2:400 Y1:482 Y2:523
Bye.

184
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,171  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:523
So that's great.

185
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,882  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
You, Bill, Ross and Emma are
gonna be so happy together.

186
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,406  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:523
What were you thinking?

187
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:43,889  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know. He was cute,
and he liked me. It was an impulse.

188
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:46,203  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
But what about Ross?
What about your moment?

189
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:48,329  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Don't you wanna talk to Ross about it?
-No.

190
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:51,485  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, because I know exactly
how the conversation's gonna go.

191
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:54,565  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:523
"Hey, Ross, you know, I think
we had a moment before."

192
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,884  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:486 Y2:523
"Yeah. Me too."

193
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:01,284  X1:110 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want
to do anything about it."

194
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:04,490  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:486 Y2:523
"Yeah. Me neither."

195
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,245  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Should we just live together...

196
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:08,483  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and not tell each other
how we're feeling?"

197
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:11,451  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:523
"Yeah, that works for me."

198
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,964  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, I see what you mean.

199
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:18,284  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
By the way, nice Ross imitation.

200
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:19,932  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

201
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,532  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well-- Hey!
-Better.

202
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,887  X1:086 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
The point is maybe I should just stop
waiting around for moments with Ross.

203
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:31,125  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know? I should just move
on with my life.

204
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,086  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:523
So really, you're moving on from Ross?

205
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:36,483  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know.
Do I have to decide right now?

206
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:39,486  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
You kind of just did.
That guy is gonna call you tonight.

207
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,531  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ross will pick up the phone,
and that's a pretty clear message.

208
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,371  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, Ross!

209
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,569  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

210
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:49,645  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have to get my number back.
Oh, my God, he's gone!

211
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:53,209  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Oh, I have to get my number back!
Oh, my God! He's gone!" Dead on.

212
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:10,684  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You know, I'm gonna take off.
-So soon?

213
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:12,172  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah.
-Okay.

214
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,767  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, thanks-- Thanks for the beer.

215
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:18,448  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You mean lager?
-Yeah. Good times.

216
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,603  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hello?
-Hey, Mike, it's me.

217
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,604  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
Listen, is-- Is Ross near you?

218
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,292  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, I just left.

219
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:39,165  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, you have to go back in.

220
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:44,370  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
What? Go back? To the land
where time stands still?

221
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,611  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm so sorry, honey, but--

222
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,684  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, Rachel gave this guy
her number...

223
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:51,083  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and she doesn't want Ross
to answer the phone.

224
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:53,164  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:523
So you have to intercept all his calls.

225
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:54,802  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:486 Y2:523
I can't do that!

226
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,891  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:442 Y2:523
-He says he can't do that.
-Give me the phone.

227
00:14:58,053 --> 00:15:01,568  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hi, Mike. Hi, listen, I know that this
is a lot to ask, but you know what?

228
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:06,887  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you do this, Phoebe will do
anything you want.

229
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:11,092  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
-All right. Thank you. Hello?

230
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:14,962  X1:085 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actually,
she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

231
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,412  X1:226 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, I'll do it.

232
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:23,087  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
But really, how much dirtier
can it get?

233
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,642  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, Mike.

234
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,448  X1:316 X2:400 Y1:482 Y2:523
Bye.

235
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:34,971  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, buddy.

236
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,932  X1:326 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hi.

237
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:41,972  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Can I come back in?
-Why?

238
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:48,726  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, I was just thinking about
how much more we have to talk about.

239
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:52,131  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:523
But you left.

240
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:58,011  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
That didn't take long.

241
00:15:58,213 --> 00:16:01,649  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought you said Tulsa was,
like, a three-hour flight?

242
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:06,002  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, you're forgetting
about the time difference.

243
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,844  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

244
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,052  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
Chandler, you're home!

245
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:22,650  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's right! Your husband's home!
So now the sex can stop!

246
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:28,848  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you saying?

247
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:30,805  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:523
Joey said you're here
with another man!

248
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:34,608  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
There's no man in here!
How dare you accuse me of that!

249
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:42,446  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:442 Y2:523
All right. Then maybe you won't mind
if me and my friend take a look around.

250
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:46,642  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's he doing?

251
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:50,243  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
I arranged some pillows on the bed
to look like a guy.

252
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:56,449  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:442 Y2:523
Bedroom's clear. Although you might
need some new pillows.

253
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,645  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:442 Y2:523
All right, well, I'll check
the guest room.

254
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:09,129  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why do I smell men's cologne?

255
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,323  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think that's you.

256
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:19,646  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine
on myself earlier.

257
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,325  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
There's nobody here, Joe.

258
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,082  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:523
I guess not.

259
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:28,685  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't believe you thought I was
cheating. You owe me an apology.

260
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,693  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You're right. I'm so sorry.
-It's an honest mistake.

261
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,889  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
It could happen to anybody. See you.

262
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,362  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:486 Y2:523
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

263
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:40,526  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you just got back from Tulsa,
how did your suitcase beat you here?

264
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:47,284  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
I climbed down the fire escape,
and you can't put that in the closet?

265
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,886  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
So, with the exception
of the fermentation process...

266
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:57,329  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
...beer and ale are
basically the same thing.

267
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,767  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:523
Fascinating, isn't it?

268
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,243  X1:078 X2:637 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

269
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,330  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll get it!

270
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:16,047  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.

271
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,206  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's for you.

272
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:26,170  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't understand
what just happened here.

273
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:30,091  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's going on?

274
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:31,322  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:35,452  X1:072 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
I told you I was in Tulsa because I
wanted to spend the night with Monica...

276
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:39,288  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and I didn't know--
I didn't think you'd understand.

277
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,962  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:523
You think I'm too dumb to understand
a husband needs to be with his wife?

278
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:47,125  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:523
You think I'm, like....

279
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,047  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Joey?
-Yeah.

280
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:55,450  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know what to say.
We shouldn't have lied to you.

281
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:58,764  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
I feel so bad. Is there anything
I can do to make it up to you?

282
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:04,364  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
You could go to the game with me.
Even though you said you couldn't.

283
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:08,811  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
But then you lied to me and tricked me
and gave me a bump on the head.

284
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:12,728  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't
do. I promised I'd be with Monica.

285
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,561  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right.

286
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:17,011  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You can go.
-What?

287
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:19,892  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
You should go to the game.
It's okay. I want you to.

288
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,893  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Really? You gonna be okay?
-Yeah, I'll be fine.

289
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:26,728  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, maybe I'll stay here
and practice the art of seduction.

290
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:31,330  X1:082 X2:633 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You're gonna put sweats on and clean.
-It's gonna be so hot!

291
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:32,882  X1:311 X2:405 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Bye.
-Bye.

292
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:34,168  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks.

293
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:36,406  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here's your ticket.

294
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,689  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thanks. Hey, listen...

295
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:41,367  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:442 Y2:523
...l'm never gonna lie
to you again, okay?

296
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:44,690  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
And I want you to know
that nobody thinks you're stupid.

297
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,482  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:486 Y2:523
Thanks, man.

298
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:52,850  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Where you going?
-Game's tomorrow night, Joe.

299
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:00,726  X1:285 X2:430 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, God!

300
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:03,646  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
So glad you're back!

301
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,291  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, what did you guys do?

302
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:09,166  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know, we just drank some beer.

303
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,927  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:523
Mike played with the boundaries
of normal social conduct.

304
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,852  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:484 Y2:523
It's true, I did.

305
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:17,682  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well, goodbye.
-Okay.

306
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:20,361  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Bye. That was fun, Pheebs.
-I know. It was fun.

307
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,251  X1:245 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:523
See you, guys.

308
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,529  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
Lock the door!
Lock the door, seriously.

309
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,693  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:523
Shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe
for the drinks.

310
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:33,884  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait, wait. Wait, sorry.
Did he call? Did that guy call?

311
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:35,486  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
