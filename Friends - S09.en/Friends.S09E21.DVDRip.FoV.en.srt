1
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:07,768
It's so weird. How did Joey
end up kissing Charlie last night?

2
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:11,926
-I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
-I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too.

3
00:00:12,093 --> 00:00:13,845
But surprise!

4
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:17,408
I missed most of the party.

5
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:18,926
Charlie's a girl, right?

6
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:24,245
Yeah, she's this new professor
in my department that I did not kiss.

7
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:28,971
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her.
Of all the girls at the party, God!

8
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:34,212
-Why do you care so much?
-Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?

9
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:41,843
Because Ross is the father of my child.

10
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:46,052
You know, and I want him
to hook up with lots of women.

11
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:51,129
All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joey
and Charlie have anything in common.

12
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:55,286
I don't know. They seemed to have
a shared interest in each other's tonsils.

13
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:59,965
Wow. Joey and a professor.
Can you imagine if they had kids?

14
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,488
And if the kids got her intelligence...

15
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:05,531
...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...

16
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:08,002
...those nerds would get laid!

17
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:13,089
All right. So, Ross, you're
okay with all this? I mean....

18
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:16,211
It's no big deal.
I just met her. I'm fine with it.

19
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:21,687
God, I forgot how hot she was.

20
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:24,563
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

21
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,566
-Oh, you know, I'll come with you.
-Okay.

22
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:32,805
-So a professor, huh?
-Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.

23
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,726
Her mind is totally acrimonious.

24
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,607
Guess that's not how she used it.

25
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:47,842
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

26
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:51,847
I don't ordinarily go around
kissing guys at parties.

27
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:53,412
I'm....

28
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:57,812
Well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really
hope you don't think less of me.

29
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:00,407
Think less of you? No.
I don't think less of you.

30
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:03,292
I mean, you saw someone you liked
and you kissed them.

31
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:06,684
Those people who like someone
and don't kiss them...

32
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:10,528
...those people are stupid.
I hate those people.

33
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,924
Actually, I'm a little surprised
at myself.

34
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:16,165
I mean, Joey's so different
from the guys I usually date.

35
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,370
They're all professors, intellectuals.
Paleontologists mostly.

36
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,366
-You know, very cerebral--
-Yeah, I know the type.

37
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:27,005
If we want to grab a bite before work,
we'd better get acrimonious.

38
00:02:29,213 --> 00:02:32,046
No?
Am I getting close?

39
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:35,329
The One With The Fertility Test

40
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:23,242
-Hey!
-Hi.

41
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,768
Hey, you guys.
Look what I just got.

42
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,125
Oh, wow! I love those!
Where did you get them?

43
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:35,003
I bought them off eBay. They used
to belong to the late Shania Twain.

44
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:40,202
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.

45
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,885
Oh, then I overpaid.

46
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,682
Hey, what's this?

47
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,845
Oh, it's a gift certificate
to this new spa in SoHo.

48
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:53,688
You can't show Phoebe this. She hates
those corporate massage chains.

49
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:56,289
What, now I can't get a massage?

50
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,684
There are so many things
that she disapproves of.

51
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,845
I can't eat veal. I can't wear fur.

52
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:05,322
I can't go hunting.

53
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:09,603
-Do you want to go hunting?
-I would like to have the option.

54
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:14,207
What's that? Hey, Rachel?

55
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,091
No, you can't go there!

56
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,767
You know how I feel about
these big massage places.

57
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,288
They're putting people like me
out of business.

58
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:23,648
She wants to go hunting too!

59
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,169
Phoebe, come on,
I don't want to waste it.

60
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,449
It would be like throwing
away 100 bucks.

61
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:34,491
Okay, this is not about
the money. Okay?

62
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:37,725
It's about corporate greed
destroying our hearts...

63
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:40,930
...and leaving us hollow shells.

64
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:44,727
I don't care about any of that.

65
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:51,130
Well, do you care about friendship?
I feel really strongly about this.

66
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,882
Please don't use this gift certificate.
I'm asking you as a friend.

67
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,972
Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!

68
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:01,041
Fine. I won't use it.

69
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,090
-Promise?
-I promise.

70
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:06,689
-Thank you.
-Well, I am going hunting.

71
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,602
Hey, honey. I missed you today.

72
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,162
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Hey.

73
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:22,523
-What do you wanna do tonight?
-Oh, well, maybe we could....

74
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:35,129
Okay, trying to turn me on
by making a mess?

75
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,806
Know your audience.

76
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,564
Besides, tomorrow we're doing
those fertility tests.

77
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,611
Until then, you need to keep
your tadpoles in the tank.

78
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,049
Do we really need to take those tests?

79
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:50,204
We've been trying
to have a baby for a year.

80
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:53,171
I think it's a good idea
to find out if everything's okay.

81
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,212
-Just a few routine tests.
-But I don't want to do it in a cup.

82
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:01,686
-What is the big deal?
-It's weird! You're in a doctor's office.

83
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:04,083
It's not okay to do it
in a doctor's office...

84
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:07,529
...but it is okay to do it in
a parked car behind a Taco Bell?

85
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:13,763
I cannot believe Ross told you that.

86
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:18,121
And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.

87
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,921
Look, I don't want to do
these tests either.

88
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:23,323
But I really do think
it's a good idea.

89
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:25,768
I'm sure a doctor's office
can't be worse...

90
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:29,050
...than on a class trip
to the Hershey factory.

91
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,922
Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!

92
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,970
Who says wine has to cost
more than milk?

93
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:48,642
-Hey!
-Hi.

94
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,969
-Come on in. How are you?
-I'm good.

95
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,727
-Can I offer you a drink?
-Please.

96
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,088
I have been crazed all day.

97
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:59,245
I had a meeting with the dean,
my syllabus for summer school's due...

98
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,449
...and I'm writing the foreword
for a book.

99
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:06,004
I had a pretty hectic day at work too.
Today I had to open a door and go:

100
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,210
So I am just so excited to be here.

101
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,490
-I can't wait to explore the city.
-If you need a tour guide....

102
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,962
Oh, you mean it?
That would be so fun.

103
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:20,012
Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.
What do you want to see first?

104
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,166
We could go see the Kronos Quartet
at Avery Fisher Hall.

105
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,807
Okay.

106
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:32,807
There's a collection of Walt Whitman
letters on display at the public library.

107
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,850
I know.

108
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:40,286
-But first, I have to see the Met.
-Okay, let me stop you right there.

109
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:43,286
The Mets suck, okay?

110
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,442
You wanna see the Yankees.

111
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:50,207
No. No, not the Mets.
The Met. Singular.

112
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:52,682
Which one? They all suck.

113
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:54,926
The museum.

114
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:58,569
I don't think so.

115
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:07,324
-Hi there.
-Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.

116
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:09,290
How may I help you?

117
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:13,722
Hi. I have a massage appointment
under Rachel Green.

118
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:18,489
-Okay.
-And here is my gift certificate.

119
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:24,649
-This has been torn up.
-And taped back together.

120
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:29,209
Okay. Well, I'll call you as soon
as your massage therapist is ready.

121
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:31,841
-Okay.
-Have a seat through the glass doors.

122
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:36,087
-Through the glass doors.
-Through the glass doors.

123
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:38,566
Alrighty then.

124
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:48,686
Phoebe, your next client's
in the waiting room.

125
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:52,129
Do we have to talk like that
when they're not around?

126
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,725
Oh, no. No, no.

127
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,769
Listen, is there someone
who can fill in for me?

128
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,170
-Sorry. Everyone is booked.
-That woman can't know I work here.

129
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,767
She's a friend of mine
and I made this big stink...

130
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:08,969
...about how awful
these massage chains are.

131
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,603
-Then why do you work here?
-Because it's good money.

132
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,691
But that doesn't change the fact...

133
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,925
...that this is an evil, bloodsucking
corporate machine.

134
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:21,530
Well, I think this is a great place
to work.

135
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:25,852
Okay, are they listening?

136
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,051
-Ross. Hey.
-Hi.

137
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:34,205
I need to talk to you about Charlie.

138
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:36,768
Oh, do you? Do you really?

139
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:39,608
Yeah, I'm kind of having
a little problem.

140
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:44,563
Look, if you don't know what the word
"acrimonious" means, just don't use it.

141
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:47,005
Look, you know Charlie, right?

142
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:50,961
-She's cool, funny, her body is so--
-Get to the problem.

143
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:55,411
Right. She's just so much smarter
than all the girls I've ever dated.

144
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:57,404
Combined.

145
00:09:57,573 --> 00:10:02,249
You know? And I just--
I don't want her to think I'm stupid.

146
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,448
Are you wearing two belts?

147
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:11,163
Hey, what do you know?

148
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,525
You were saying you didn't want
to seem stupid.

149
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:22,129
Well, she wants to go
to all these cultural places...

150
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:26,366
...and I don't know how to talk about
that stuff. You gotta help me out.

151
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:29,366
I don't want to get involved
in your guys' relationship.

152
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:32,525
Oh, dude, please. Come on,
you're the smartest person I know.

153
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:36,652
And I really like this girl, okay?
I don't want to lose her.

154
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,162
-Fine.
-Thanks.

155
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,085
Okay. Let's see.

156
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:46,928
-Oh, you should take her to the Met.
-The Mets.

157
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,887
No, no, no. The Met.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

158
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,683
Oh, that's what she meant.

159
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:59,209
If they're gonna shorten it, they
should call it the "Muse, " you know?

160
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:02,012
Short for "museum"
and avoid all the confusion.

161
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:08,925
Yeah, most days the place is packed
with confused, angry baseball fans.

162
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:11,846
Okay. All right,
so I'll take her to the Met.

163
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:17,724
Yeah. Okay. There's this great
rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.

164
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:20,249
You know what?
She loves architecture.

165
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,849
You should take a walk down Fifth
to the St. Patrick's Cathedral.

166
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:27,562
And there, there's this great
little pastry shop that she'd love.

167
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,247
Jeez. Sounds like you
should be going on this date.

168
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:32,485
But I'm not.

169
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,048
-And you know what--?
-Okay, slow down.

170
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:39,364
You're going way too fast.
Okay? Just go back to the Met.

171
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,127
So you gotta tell me exactly
what to do there.

172
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:44,682
When you walk into the museum,
take a right, okay?

173
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,366
That's the antiquities wing.

174
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,684
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,
up to the Byzantine Empire.

175
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:56,208
Okay. So I walk in the door
and make a right.

176
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:11,531
I have a weird feeling about
this place. How do I know...

177
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:15,572
...they won't secretly videotape me
and put it all over the Internet?

178
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,926
Because, honey, and I mean this
in the sweetest way possible...

179
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,448
...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.

180
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,605
Mr. Bing? Here you are.

181
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:29,651
Go into that room and deposit
your specimen into the container.

182
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,212
Deposit my specimen?

183
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:34,763
I usually have to call a 900 number
for that kind of talk.

184
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,644
Thanks. Got it.

185
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:43,603
All right. Honey, my tests
are down the hall.

186
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:46,845
-Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
-Yeah, I guess.

187
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,766
Look, I know this is embarrassing,
but nobody cares.

188
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,606
No one here even knows you.

189
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,807
Oh, my God!

190
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,127
Oh, come on!

191
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,849
How great is this?

192
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:15,886
We're probably fertile.
Let's go home.

193
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,966
Why are you here?

194
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,284
Sid and I are trying again
and we had trouble last time--

195
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:27,128
No, no, no. I mean, why?
Why is she here?

196
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:31,805
Oh, someone's a little cranky today
because they have to do it in a cup.

197
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,441
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.

198
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:39,010
What?

199
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:46,005
This was fun. But I've got
an invasive vaginal exam to get to.

200
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:50,883
I'd love to stay
but I've got a hot date.

201
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:54,966
Please go. Just let me know
if you need a hand.

202
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:02,647
I think it just fell off.

203
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,969
Hello, ja.

204
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:14,167
It's time for your massage, ja?

205
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,324
Put your face in the hole.

206
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:21,970
A Swedish massage
from a real Swedish person.

207
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,772
Okay, then I'm Swedish.

208
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:29,088
So, what's your name?

209
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:31,926
It's a normal Swedish name.

210
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:33,685
Ikea.

211
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:38,325
-Wow. What an interesting name.
-Yeah.

212
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:41,565
-You know, l--
-Time for your scalp massage.

213
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:46,331
Wow. I really love your--

214
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:52,048
-Is something wrong?
-No, it's just....

215
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:54,204
It just feels so good...

216
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:56,091
...lkea.

217
00:14:57,093 --> 00:15:01,086
Hey, say, you'll know this.
What's the capital of Sweden?

218
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:03,892
Stockholm.

219
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,807
Damn. I wish I knew
if that was right.

220
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:12,561
Note the painterly lines
and subtle impasto on this canvas.

221
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:15,367
Monet painted quickly,
and usually outdoors...

222
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:19,526
...as his elusive subject
was light itself.

223
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:24,763
Now, do you have any idea
what you just said?

224
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:31,572
No, no. My mouth says the words,
my brain is thinking "monster trucks."

225
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:35,929
Now, remember,
when you get to the museum...

226
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:39,927
...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.
I just--

227
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:44,450
-I wrote that out phonetically for you.
-Phonetically?

228
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:48,569
Yeah, that means--
We just don't have time for this.

229
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:53,249
I gotta say, I'm really impressed you
were able to memorize all this so quickly.

230
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:55,888
I'm an actor.
I can memorize anything.

231
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:57,606
Last week on Days, I had to say:

232
00:15:57,773 --> 00:16:00,003
"Frontal temporal
zygomatic craniotomy."

233
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:03,961
-Wow. What does that mean?
-No idea.

234
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:07,364
But the guy I said it to
dies in the next scene...

235
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,331
...so I guess it means,
"You'll get eaten by a bear."

236
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,572
Okay.

237
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,211
-So let's move on to the Renaissance.
-Okay.

238
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:22,562
Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...

239
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,691
...to highlight the anguish
of the central figure.

240
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,525
Touch it. It's really bumpy.

241
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:33,324
No, no, no. No ad-libbing. And, dude,
you can't touch the paintings.

242
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,687
-Come on.
-No. No!

243
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,329
My specimen's in the room.

244
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:51,566
I just want to thank whoever knocked
on the door while I was in there.

245
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,769
Really helped speed the process along.

246
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:59,253
Janice, you're not gone?

247
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:01,641
Sid is still in his room.

248
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:06,011
I don't allow porn at home,
so this is like a vacation for him.

249
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:10,046
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?

250
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:14,331
-Yeah. The hard part's over.
-That's not the hard part, honey.

251
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:18,850
The hard part's what comes next.
Aren't you worried about the results?

252
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:21,408
I haven't even thought
about the results.

253
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,803
I just assumed everything
would be okay.

254
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:26,168
Well, you know what? It probably is.

255
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:27,852
But what if it's not okay?

256
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,085
I mean, what if there's a reason
we can't have a baby?

257
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:34,450
Chandler. Look, you and Monica
are meant to have children.

258
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:36,569
I'm sure it's gonna be just fine.

259
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:43,207
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. I can't
believe I didn't even think of that.

260
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:47,764
I guess I was so worried about
having to come here and do that.

261
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,163
You can do it
in a Taco Bell parking lot...

262
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,722
...but you can't do it
at a doctor's office?

263
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,168
It was a Wendy's!

264
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:11,049
And that's the Swedish national anthem.
Thank you for asking.

265
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:14,443
Wow, lkea.

266
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,368
What a rich culture.

267
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:20,206
You know what?
I have a friend who's a masseuse.

268
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:23,922
-Oh? Ja, ja?
-Ja. She's not very good, though.

269
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:32,483
-And why do you think that is?
-I don't know.

270
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,725
Maybe it's because she's got
such callousy fingers...

271
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:38,453
...from playing crummy guitar.

272
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:49,562
Or maybe she has trouble
loosening your knots...

273
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:53,043
...because you're such
a high-maintenance tight-ass.

274
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:54,931
-Phoebe!
-You know it's me?

275
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,243
Well, for like a half an hour!

276
00:18:57,413 --> 00:19:00,132
Man, you can lie about Sweden!

277
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:03,211
How can you come here?

278
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:06,763
-Why didn't you tell me you work here?
-I don't have to tell you everything!

279
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:10,289
You do if you're gonna make me feel
guilty for getting a free massage.

280
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:12,604
Tip's not included.

281
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,283
Why did you lie to me
about working here?

282
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:20,571
Because I was ashamed, okay?
I sold out for the cash.

283
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:25,761
And they give me benefits, like medical
and dental and a four-oh-wunk.

284
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:35,529
But, you know, you pay a price.
Now I'm this corporate stooge...

285
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:37,888
...and punching a clock...

286
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,850
...and paying taxes!

287
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:43,491
Phoebe, honey,
if you hate it so much...

288
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:47,248
...you should walk out there
right now and quit.

289
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,922
Be true to what you believe in.

290
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:53,563
Honey, you have principles,
and I so admire that.

291
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,849
I don't have any.

292
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,411
You know what? You're right.
I am gonna quit.

293
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:04,168
-It's time I took my life back.
-Good for you, Pheebs.

294
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:11,923
If you guys have microphones in
there too, I didn't mean any of that.

295
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:14,370
I love you.

296
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:21,205
Got you!
Die! Die! Die!

297
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:26,411
Respectfully, Professor R. Geller.

298
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,724
Hey, how was the Met?

299
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:32,884
The museum was amazing.

300
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:35,328
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?

301
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:37,563
Not so much, no.

302
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,327
He had clearly memorized
all this stuff to say...

303
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:43,132
...and some of it didn't
even make any sense.

304
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,565
-What do you mean?
-Well, for one...

305
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,566
...he was talking about paintings
that were nowhere around.

306
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:55,610
Wait a minute. When you guys walked
into the Met, did you go to the right?

307
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:59,561
-No. No, we went to the left.
-Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.

308
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:05,249
Still, it seems like you guys
are having a great time together.

309
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,612
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

310
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:11,762
What?

311
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:15,290
Actually, Joey's your friend...

312
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:17,967
...and you don't know me that well.
It'd be weird.

313
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,887
Well, I mean, a little.
But no, what? Go on.

314
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:22,042
Well....

315
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:26,603
I'm thinking that maybe Joey
isn't the right guy for me right now.

316
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:29,845
You know, maybe I should
be with someone...

317
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:35,408
...I have more in common with.
You know what I mean?

318
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:38,206
Yeah.

319
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:43,002
Yeah, but you know what?

320
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:47,005
I think you should give Joey a chance.

321
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,925
I mean, he's a great guy.

322
00:21:49,093 --> 00:21:51,561
And sure, he doesn't know
that much about art...

323
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,327
...but you can always talk about
that with someone else.

324
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,643
-I guess that's true.
-If you think about it...

325
00:21:56,853 --> 00:22:00,812
...he memorized all that stuff because
he thought it was important to you.

326
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:03,567
You know, that's the kind of guy
Joey is.

327
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:06,167
He is very sweet.

328
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,925
Plus, he is hot!

329
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:12,569
That was gonna be my next argument.

330
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:16,804
-You ready?
-Yeah. Let's go.

331
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:17,962
Wow!

332
00:22:19,653 --> 00:22:21,723
-Thanks, Ross.
-Yeah.

333
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:26,323
Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.
You hooked me up.

334
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:29,281
Glad I could help, man.

335
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:33,372
Some of the stuff wasn't where you said
it would be, but I made it work.

336
00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:47,292
It is not okay that I'm aroused
by this now.

337
00:22:50,773 --> 00:22:51,762
Hello?

338
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:55,086
Oh. Hi, Dr. Connelly.

339
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:57,728
No. Well, she's not here...

340
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,372
...but I can tell her.

341
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:02,172
Should I be sitting down for this?

342
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,321
Well, so, what does that mean?

343
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:26,288
Okay. Okay, thank you.

344
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:28,011
Thanks.

345
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,452
Hey, sweetie.

346
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,766
Dr. Connelly just called.

347
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:40,163
With good news?
Of course it's not good news.

348
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,085
You said, "Dr. Connelly just called."

349
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:45,165
If it was good, you'd have said,
"Dr. Connelly just called!"

350
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,403
So, what is it? Is it...?

351
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:51,452
Is there a problem? Is there
a problem with me, or with you?

352
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,249
Actually, it's both of us.

353
00:23:56,573 --> 00:23:58,052
What?

354
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:01,250
Apparently, my sperm
have low motility...

355
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:06,089
...and you have
an inhospitable environment.

356
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:15,924
Well, what does that mean?

357
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:19,489
It means that my guys won't
get off their Barcaloungers...

358
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:23,202
...and you have a uterus that is
prepared to kill the ones that do.

359
00:24:25,893 --> 00:24:28,043
-It means--
-Wait, Chandler.

360
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,852
It means that we can keep trying...

361
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:39,002
...but there's a good chance
this may never happen for us.

362
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,370
Oh, my God.

363
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:50,005
I'm sorry.

364
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,325
I'm sorry too.

365
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:57,172
Well...

366
00:24:57,693 --> 00:25:00,571
...we're gonna figure this out.

367
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:05,165
I know.

368
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,482
-Good morning, Phoebe.
-Good morning, receptionist.

369
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:28,043
Here's your schedule for the day.
Your first client is in Room 1 .

370
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:32,282
"Rachel Green."
Son of a bitch! She came back?

371
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:43,364
Are you ready
for your Scottish massage?

372
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:45,843
Put your face in the hole, lassie!

373
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:52,202
