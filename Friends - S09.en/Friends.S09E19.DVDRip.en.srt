1
00:00:03,498 --> 00:00:05,295  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
God, you're beautiful.

2
00:00:05,978 --> 00:00:08,173  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why are we fighting this?

3
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:12,332  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know you want it to happen
as much as I do.

4
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:16,411  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
I want you. I need you.

5
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:21,212  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let me make love to you.

6
00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:24,097  X1:138 X2:582 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't wanna stand in the way
of true love or anything...

7
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,455  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but I think a cantaloupe
might hurt less.

8
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:29,927  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, I'm rehearsing my lines.

9
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:32,771  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
They're giving me a romantic story
on Days of our Lives.

10
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:36,527  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's the first time my character's got
one. I'm nervous. I want it to be good.

11
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:41,010  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
I haven't seen you this worked-up since
you did that dog-food commercial...

12
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:45,217  X1:093 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and you thought you were gonna be
with a real talking dog.

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,846  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, that was a disappointment.

14
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:51,772  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
You wanna come down to the set
and tell me if I'm doing okay?

15
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:53,491  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

16
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:56,371  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
You just have to promise not
to get thrown out again.

17
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:59,177  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
-That was an honest mistake.
-Right.

18
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:03,570  X1:095 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:523
"Oh, my God. Is this the men's room?
I feel so foolish.

19
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:07,413  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
Have you always known
you wanted to be an actor?"

20
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:11,455  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, that was an awesome day.

21
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:13,934  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:486 Y2:523
The One With Rachel's Dream

22
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:54,088  X1:074 X2:644 Y1:054 Y2:128
You guys wanna come eat dinner
at the restaurant in the next few weeks?

23
00:01:54,298 --> 00:01:56,892  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'd love to.
-Well, you can't.

24
00:01:58,178 --> 00:02:01,568  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:054 Y2:134
-We're booked solid for the next month.
-Well, I can't give you a massage...

25
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:05,048  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:054 Y2:133
...because my license
has been revoked again.

26
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:08,654  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:054 Y2:133
-Phoebe, what happened?
-Well, it was an accident, you know.

27
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,094  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:054 Y2:134
It's a lot of oil and sometimes
the hand just slips.

28
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:16,491  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Have I got a surprise for you.
Pack your bags.

29
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:20,890  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:054 Y2:134
Oh, no. You guys aren't supposed
to get divorced for seven years.

30
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:25,535  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:054 Y2:129
What? No, I'm taking Monica
to a romantic inn in Vermont.

31
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:31,056  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:054 Y2:133
Oh, good. Okay, good for you.
Trying to recapture the magic.

32
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:34,608  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:054 Y2:133
-So can you get out of work?
-Honey, I can't.

33
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:38,373  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:054 Y2:133
-Things are crazy at the restaurant.
-You're really that busy?

34
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:41,138  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:054 Y2:095
Yeah. I'm sorry, I really am.

35
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:44,495  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's okay. I'll just try and reschedule.

36
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:48,093  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:054 Y2:128
Hi, this is Chandler Bing.
I made a reservation there...

37
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:50,772  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:054 Y2:094
...and I need to change it.

38
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:55,451  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
What do you mean it's nonrefundable?
Well, can I just come some other time?

39
00:02:56,498 --> 00:02:58,011  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:054 Y2:095
Can't you make an exception?

40
00:02:58,218 --> 00:03:00,891  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:442 Y2:523
Tell them I'm a chef
at a big New York restaurant.

41
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:05,330  X1:081 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
Tell them that in two weeks, I will once
again be a masseuse in good standing.

42
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:10,173  X1:110 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look, this is ridiculous.
I'm not paying for that room, okay?

43
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:13,091  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, thank you very much.

44
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:16,137  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, I'm going to Vermont.

45
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:20,052  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Don't worry, use your travel insurance.
-I don't have travel insurance.

46
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:24,490  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, this is what happens
when people live on the edge.

47
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:26,814  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why don't you take Ross?

48
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:31,017  X1:084 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
Don't you think that'll be a little weird?
I mean, two guys in a romantic inn?

49
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,927  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No, not if the room has two beds.
-I guess.

50
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,852  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
It still seems a little--
"Moonlight boat ride"?!

51
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,291  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, is this the bed
where Olivia lost her virginity?

52
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:49,092  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:523
I don't know,
but one of the extras sure did.

53
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:52,568  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
Listen, Rach. Thanks again
for coming down to watch my scenes.

54
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:56,134  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
Please, honey. Just the fact that you
want me here to support you, I'm--

55
00:03:56,298 --> 00:04:00,928  X1:079 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God. Is that Christian Saunders?
He is so gorgeous!

56
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,698  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
And also, so gay.

57
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:07,612  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, in my head,
he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.

58
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:12,016  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, at the Christmas party, him
and Santa did some definitely-gay stuff.

59
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:14,294  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey? Joey, we're ready for you.

60
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,414  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. All right, wish me luck.

61
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:20,127  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay. Not that you need it, but good--
God! Is that Chase Lassiter?

62
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,416  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:442 Y2:523
-He's straight, right?
-Rach, if you weren't here wondering...

63
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:26,968  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:523
...if these guys were gay,
I don't know if I could do this.

64
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:30,170  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry. Good luck.

65
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:33,694  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
On a bell, please. Quietly.

66
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,576  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:523
And action!

67
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,769  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:523
Drake, what are you doing here?

68
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:40,735  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
Stopping you from marrying
the wrong man...

69
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:42,889  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and making the biggest
mistake of your life.

70
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,134  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Get out.
-You don't love him.

71
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:46,817  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
What do you know about love?

72
00:04:47,018 --> 00:04:49,657  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know what I felt that night
when we kissed under the bridge.

73
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:53,373  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:523
-That kiss never happened.
-Well, what about this one?

74
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,051  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:523
Now, I told you to get out.

75
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:00,095  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:482 Y2:523
Fine, I'll go.

76
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:02,730  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
But let me ask you one question.

77
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:06,971  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You look real familiar. Have we--?
-Shh! He's asking her a question.

78
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:11,692  X1:091 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Can you live the rest of your life never
knowing what we could have been?

79
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:14,731  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I don't have a choice.
-Yes, you do.

80
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:19,289  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yes, you do. I'm the one who doesn't
have a choice because I....

81
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,416  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because I can't stop loving you.

82
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:26,287  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Don't say that.
-Tell me to stop.

83
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:28,569  X1:300 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just...

84
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:32,050  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:523
...tell me to stop.

85
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:34,897  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Cut!
-No!

86
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:39,334  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
Or, cut. You know, that's your call.

87
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:43,049  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Everything was delicious.
-Thank you.

88
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,652  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
It was. The duck in particular
was superb.

89
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:48,048  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

90
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:52,888  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
You haven't said anything.

91
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:55,487  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually, I do have one small complaint.

92
00:05:55,658 --> 00:06:00,095  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, please, I welcome criticism.

93
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:03,889  X1:073 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:523
The musician right outside the restaurant
is kind of a mood killer.

94
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,133  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:488 Y2:523
What musician?

95
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:25,651  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you doing here?

96
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:29,692  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:523
You said you had customers lined up
in the street, so I'm here to entertain.

97
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:32,531  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Great.
-Yeah, it really has been great too.

98
00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:34,569  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
They must have seen me
play before...

99
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:37,093  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
...because they requested
a bunch of my songs.

100
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:39,533  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:523
Yeah, "You Suck" ...

101
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,529  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and "Shut Up and Go Home."

102
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:47,610  X1:100 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
Listen, Phoebe. You know how much
I love listening to your music...

103
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:50,497  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:448 Y2:523
-...but....
-But what?

104
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:55,414  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
This is kind of a classy place.

105
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:57,046  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, say no more.

106
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,413  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
Everyone!

107
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:09,170  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:523
Classy, huh?

108
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:16,415  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi, Chandler Bing. I have a reservation.

109
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:19,331  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
Welcome to the Chestnut Inn.
Where are you joining us from?

110
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:22,416  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:444 Y2:523
-New York.
-The Big Apple.

111
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:26,457  X1:076 X2:644 Y1:442 Y2:523
He's wound up. We had to stop at every
maple-candy stand on the way here.

112
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:29,735  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
I ate all my gifts for everybody.

113
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:34,295  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, there's no record
of your reservation in the computer.

114
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:39,094  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
-That's impossible. Check again, please.
-Check again, please.

115
00:07:40,018 --> 00:07:43,488  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I'm sorry, it's not here.
-It's not there.

116
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:47,048  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Let me get this straight. I called
to try to cancel my reservation...

117
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:50,893  X1:082 X2:638 Y1:442 Y2:523
...was told it's not refundable. Then we
drove six hours all the way up here...

118
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:54,095  X1:073 X2:647 Y1:442 Y2:523
-...and now we don't have a reservation?
-I don't know what to say.

119
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,414  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
She doesn't know what to say.

120
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,614  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just give us
the cheapest room you have.

121
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:02,652  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
The only thing we have available
is our deluxe suite. The rate is $600.

122
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,167  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:442 Y2:523
-That's insane.
-It's totally insane.

123
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:09,217  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
Let's drive home. We'll hit all the
maple-candy stores on the way back...

124
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:15,169  X1:073 X2:646 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and if they're closed, then maybe we'll
tap a tree and make some ourselves.

125
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:19,251  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:523
Does that room have a closet
I can lock him in?

126
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,816  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:523
-We'll take it.
-Great.

127
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:25,851  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
-They are totally ripping us off !
-Dude, don't worry about it.

128
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:29,931  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know how to make your money back.
This is a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities.

129
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:34,694  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
We just load up on those. Like those
apples. Instead of taking one...

130
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:37,008  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:488 Y2:523
...I take six.

131
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:41,127  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:523
Great. At $100 an apple, we're there.

132
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:45,416  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come on, you get the idea. You know,
we'll make our money back in no time.

133
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:50,248  X1:072 X2:648 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Dude, you're shaking.
-It's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?

134
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:56,211  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi.
-Hey.

135
00:08:56,378 --> 00:09:00,974  X1:071 X2:646 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, I got to tell you, I have been
thinking all day about that scene you did.

136
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:03,129  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:523
You were amazing.

137
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,535  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, the writing was good.
And the director's good.

138
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:08,734  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
And my costar's good.

139
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,854  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
But they're not as good as me!

140
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,334  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
You have to tell me
what happens tomorrow.

141
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:17,211  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm going over the script now.
Wanna read lines with me?

142
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:20,688  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:523
Me? Oh, I'm not an actress.

143
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:24,573  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
-All right, I can ask Monica.
-Screw her! That part is mine!

144
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,411  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, so just from the top
of the page right here.

145
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:29,773  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

146
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:35,255  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hello, Drake.
I'm surprised to see you here.

147
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,609  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:446 Y2:523
-I can't believe you married him.
-Well, what choice did I have?

148
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,929  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:523
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.

149
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,575  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
So, what about us?
Everything we feel for each other?

150
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:50,133  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's over. You have to accept that.

151
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,610  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:442 Y2:523
How can l, knowing I'll never
hold you in my arms again...

152
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:58,657  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:523
...or touch your skin or feel your lips...

153
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:02,210  X1:090 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:523
...knowing I'll never make love to you?

154
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:05,256  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
How can I accept
that I can never kiss you again...

155
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:08,296  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:442 Y2:523
...when it's all I can do not
to kiss you right now?

156
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:12,613  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:488 Y2:523
Kiss me.

157
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:15,456  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

158
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:17,492  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:488 Y2:523
Kiss me.

159
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:22,850  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Rach, it doesn't say that.
-No, I'm saying it.

160
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:25,737  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:523
-But--
-Just don't talk.

161
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:34,455  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:523
Well, that's new.

162
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:46,848  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.

163
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:48,730  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
I've forgotten a couple of things.

164
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:53,016  X1:104 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
Could you have some complimentary
toiletries sent up to my room?

165
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:56,807  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thank you.
Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...

166
00:10:56,978 --> 00:11:02,769  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
...razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,
Band-Aids, shaving cream, after shave.

167
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:04,894  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I feel like I'm forgetting something.

168
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:09,529  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Is there anything else you have
that I haven't asked for already?

169
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:12,890  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, go ahead,
send up some tampons.

170
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,776  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:442 Y2:523
-What'd you get?
-USA Today.

171
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:18,849  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice. Put it with the others.

172
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:22,886  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I also got two more apples.

173
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:24,929  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:486 Y2:523
We're four short of a bushel!

174
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:29,737  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
God, I feel so alive.
I love being in the country!

175
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,128  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
Also, got these great
salt and pepper shakers...

176
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:34,493  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:523
-...from the restaurant.
-That's not cool.

177
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:38,252  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:486 Y2:523
Dude, none of this is cool.

178
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:42,254  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look, Chandler, you have to find
the line between stealing...

179
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:44,613  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and taking what the hotel owes you.

180
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:47,497  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
For example: a hair dryer, no, no, no.

181
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:50,656  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
But shampoos and conditioners,
yes, yes, yes.

182
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:55,208  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:486 Y2:523
Now, the salt shaker is off limits.

183
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:59,132  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:523
But, the salt....

184
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:01,937  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
I wish I'd thought this through.

185
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:05,977  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think I get what you mean, though.
Like, the lamp is the hotel's...

186
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:09,175  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but the bulbs--
Oh, you already got that.

187
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:12,176  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:523
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.

188
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:14,977  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Okay, how about this?
-No, no, no.

189
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:19,456  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:446 Y2:523
-You can't take the remote control.
-Yes, but the batteries.

190
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:25,930  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you. Thank you very much.

191
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:29,414  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Let's celebrate with some maple candy.
-No!

192
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:34,009  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
At least tell me where you hid it.

193
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:40,296  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

194
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:43,456  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Have you ever had any...

195
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:47,975  X1:169 X2:551 Y1:486 Y2:523
...weird, romantic dreams?

196
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,691  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let me think.

197
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:55,926  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
When I was younger, I used to dream
that I got married to Mayor McCheese.

198
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:59,056  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:523
And on our wedding night,
I ate his head.

199
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:02,848  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

200
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:05,373  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, this is like that...

201
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:07,369  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:523
...in no way.

202
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:11,326  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
I had a dream last night
that I wanted to kiss Joey.

203
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:14,331  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:523
Wow! You mean like
"kiss him" kiss him?

204
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:17,695  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it was pretty intense.

205
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,934  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What brought that on?
-I don't know.

206
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:23,016  X1:130 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:523
Maybe it had to do with the fact
I saw him do a love scene.

207
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,413  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
-A love scene? With who?
-Olivia.

208
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:28,769  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
Olivia?!
I thought she was marrying Connor?!

209
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,930  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, right. Real life more important.

210
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:35,414  X1:093 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You think my dream means anything?
-I don't know.

211
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:39,850  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, you saw him do a love scene.
Maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.

212
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:42,930  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe you have a thing for Drake.

213
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:49,450  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, it was Joey reading
Drake's lines in the dream.

214
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:53,253  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Of course it was. Trust me,
when it comes to psychology...

215
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:56,535  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I know what I'm talking about.

216
00:13:56,698 --> 00:14:00,691  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I took two psych classes in college.
-You took the same class twice.

217
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:03,332  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:448 Y2:523
-It was hard!
-I know.

218
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:06,208  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey.
-Hi.

219
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:11,133  X1:093 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
Here, Monica, look what I got to wear
when I play at your restaurant.

220
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:17,448  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wait.

221
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,488  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:523
Right? I think this might even class up
"The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man."

222
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:27,776  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:523
Phoebe...

223
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,771  X1:137 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
...maybe I wasn't clear before.

224
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:34,294  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
I really love listening
to your music here.

225
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,211  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
But my restaurant,
it's sort of an upscale place.

226
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,969  X1:087 X2:629 Y1:442 Y2:523
Right, yeah, okay. I'll ask the butler
to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.

227
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:44,891  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe, it's not what you wear.

228
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:48,095  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's sort of your songs.

229
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:51,170  X1:128 X2:593 Y1:442 Y2:523
I just don't think you should play
at the restaurant anymore.

230
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,656  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Fine, I'll just--

231
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:59,457  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'll take the hat back.

232
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:03,294  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
There.

233
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:11,370  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, so you guys, the funniest
thing happened at work the--

234
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,569  X1:150 X2:570 Y1:442 Y2:523
My songs aren't good enough
for your restaurant?

235
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,246  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, we're still on that.

236
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,814  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I didn't say they weren't good enough.
-Then what's wrong with them?

237
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:22,936  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
What, they don't go with your
tiny portions of pretentious food?

238
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:26,333  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Tiny portions?
-Yeah, well, "Excuse me.

239
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:31,492  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:448 Y2:523
I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,
but I can't see it. I can't see it."

240
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:37,326  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
-Well, it's not about quality.

241
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:40,448  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, really?
You wanna talk about quality?

242
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:44,776  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:442 Y2:523
Have you ever heard of a "key"?
It's what some people sing in.

243
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:48,766  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, at least all my songs
don't taste like garlic.

244
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:51,367  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, there are other
ingredients, Monica.

245
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:53,891  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
So that's what we're doing.

246
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:56,936  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
When I'm in a coffeehouse bopping
along to one of your songs...

247
00:15:57,098 --> 00:16:00,647  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:442 Y2:523
-...l'm wearing earplugs.
-Earplugs or cloves of garlic?

248
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:04,608  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know what?
I take back what I said before.

249
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:08,532  X1:084 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
Keep playing at the restaurant, because
with your music driving people inside...

250
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,336  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
...my bar sales
have gone up like crazy.

251
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:13,376  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
What are people having,
the garlic martini?

252
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:18,413  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:442 Y2:523
Here's your bill.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.

253
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:22,247  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, we did.
And you still have all your lamps.

254
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:27,773  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I didn't factor in the room tax.
-Dude, don't worry about it.

255
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:32,807  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:442 Y2:523
I found an unattended maid's cart.
We're way ahead of the game.

256
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:35,173  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Oh, my God.
-What?

257
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:37,852  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
There's something new in the bowl.

258
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:42,614  X1:074 X2:644 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Look, we have enough. Just walk away.
-No, but I want the pine cones.

259
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,053  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:523
-There's a forest right outside.
-It's not the same.

260
00:16:47,258 --> 00:16:49,692  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, go quick.

261
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:59,011  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you for a delightful stay.

262
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:10,011  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:523
My maple candy!

263
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:24,889  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's just you. I thought someone was
swinging a bag of cats against the wall.

264
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:29,575  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
You'd better get back in that kitchen.
The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.

265
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:32,172  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay, you have to stop playing now.
-Why?

266
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:34,533  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
The only person my playing
is bothering is you.

267
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:39,692  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.
-Get your garlic peelers off me.

268
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:42,169  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse me? Excuse me?

269
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:45,728  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hi, I'm Monica Geller.
I'm the head chef here.

270
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:49,728  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, I was actually expecting
a little applause there, but whatever.

271
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,577  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
Quick question.
By a show of hands...

272
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,777  X1:117 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
...how many of you were bothered
by this woman's singing outside?

273
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:01,053  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, okay. How many of you
enjoyed the music outside?

274
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:06,774  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
Let me ask you this question.
How many thought the music was fine...

275
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:10,772  X1:118 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:523
...but not in keeping with the tone
of the restaurant?

276
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:15,932  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
Who identified this restaurant's tone
as "pretentious-comma-garlicky"?

277
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:21,968  X1:071 X2:648 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
and a little pretension never hurt anyone?

278
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:26,054  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:523
Okay, well, all right, who thinks
the food is fine, the music was fine...

279
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:29,574  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but your evening was ruined
by this incessant poll-taking?

280
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:35,453  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse us.

281
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:39,974  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, here's a question.

282
00:18:40,778 --> 00:18:44,009  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Who was so worried about
her restaurant being fancy...

283
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:47,250  X1:127 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that she made a big deal about
her friend playing her music...

284
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,569  X1:108 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and feels really bad about it now?

285
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:54,046  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, who was so stupid
and stubborn...

286
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,493  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that she lashed out
against her friend's cooking...

287
00:18:56,658 --> 00:18:59,889  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
...which she actually thinks
is pretty great?

288
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,896  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry too.

289
00:19:03,178 --> 00:19:06,011  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, you wanna stick around
and I'll whip you up some dinner?

290
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:10,734  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah, as long as it's free.
The food here is ridiculously overpr--

291
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:17,934  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
Who hopes the hand-raising thing is still
cute enough that you won't hate me?

292
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:27,894  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, do you have peanut butter
on the back of your head?

293
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:33,295  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, man. I thought I got it all.

294
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:36,091  X1:293 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:523
How...?

295
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,976  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
How?

296
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,573  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was making a peanut butter
smoothie, right?

297
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:44,731  X1:097 X2:624 Y1:442 Y2:523
I couldn't find this little plastic thingy
that goes in the top of the blender.

298
00:19:44,898 --> 00:19:48,891  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
And I thought, "Well, you know,
how important can that be?" Right?

299
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,130  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Turns out, very.

300
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,689  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow, definitely just Drake.

301
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:57,448  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-How's it going with Drake?

302
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,773  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I don't think it's going very well.
-What?

303
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:02,730  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
That scene I saw was so good.

304
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:07,375  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I'm feeling really insecure
about the one we're shooting tomorrow.

305
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:11,617  X1:074 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
Is this that thing you do when you say
you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?

306
00:20:11,938 --> 00:20:13,849  X1:295 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
A little.

307
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:20,127  X1:074 X2:646 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I really am worried. I have to make it
convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.

308
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:23,176  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
-So?
-So I've never played that.

309
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:27,007  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, honey, it can't be that hard.
I mean, you've been in love before.

310
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:30,895  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, just once...

311
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:33,253  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:523
...with you.

312
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:36,768  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay. Well, this could be
a little awkward.

313
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:39,327  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm just gonna blow past it.

314
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:42,410  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, look, can't you just use
that method-actor thing...

315
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:47,294  X1:081 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
...where you use your real-life memories
to help you in your performance?

316
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,733  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
What the hell are you talking about?

317
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:57,728  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, look, just try to remember
how you felt when you were in love...

318
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:01,254  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and think about that
when you're playing the scene.

319
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:06,569  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Yeah, I think I can do that.

320
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:09,696  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah. Okay, there's this
party scene coming up.

321
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,008  X1:085 X2:631 Y1:488 Y2:523
And Olivia and her husband are there...

322
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:17,172  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and all Drake wants to do is
grab her and kiss her, but he can't.

323
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:21,695  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
That makes me think about those times
I wanted to grab you and kiss you...

324
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:25,009  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:442 Y2:523
...but you didn't know, so I would
just pretend everything was cool...

325
00:21:25,178 --> 00:21:27,134  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
...but really it was killing me.

326
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:32,892  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:523
Joey, you never
talked about that before.

327
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:37,816  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, you know what else I could use?

328
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:41,175  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:523
There's this scene where Drake
sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...

329
00:21:41,338 --> 00:21:45,536  X1:110 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and she doesn't know he's there,
which never happened with us.

330
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:51,613  X1:078 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,
but he just wants to look at her.

331
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,377  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know?

332
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:59,328  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
And I remember all those mornings
before you even put on your makeup...

333
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:04,652  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
...when I would think to myself,
"My God, she is beautiful."

334
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:11,133  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
And it hurt so much because I knew
I could never tell you.

335
00:22:13,738 --> 00:22:18,528  X1:114 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
But it was worth it just to be there
looking at you.

336
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:25,735  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thanks, dude. This is great!

337
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:38,213  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:054 Y2:094
I got you something from Vermont.

338
00:22:38,418 --> 00:22:40,488  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:094
Besides tampons and salt?

339
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:43,656  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:054 Y2:094
Oh, my God.

340
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:47,294  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:054 Y2:095
Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.

341
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:50,175  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:054 Y2:095
That's weird, it's empty.

342
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:55,566  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:054 Y2:134
Hi, you guys. What's going on?
You guys wanna hang out or...?

343
00:23:01,658 --> 00:23:03,410  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:054 Y2:094
Do you guys hear a buzzing?

344
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:09,887  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:054 Y2:133
