1
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:06,929  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go.

2
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:11,088  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's right. Daddy and Uncle Joey
are going on a trip today.

3
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:15,686  X1:071 X2:645 Y1:442 Y2:523
We're going to a conference in Barbados.
Right? Can you say, "Barbados"?

4
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:17,732  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Barbados.

5
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:23,489  X1:085 X2:634 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay. I've gotta say, it means so much
to me that you guys are coming...

6
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:26,249  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
...all the way over there
to hear me give my speech.

7
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:29,208  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
And I have a surprise.
I had to pull some strings...

8
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:34,210  X1:081 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but I was able to get everyone passes
to the entire conference. That's right!

9
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:40,570  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
These babies will get you into all
the paleontology lectures and seminars.

10
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:44,690  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you have anything
that will get us out of them?

11
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:48,453  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:523
We're excited to hear the speech,
but the rest of the time...

12
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,446  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:523
...we're gonna want to do island stuff.

13
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:52,771  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:523
David will probably want to hear
a few lectures.

14
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:54,886  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Right, because he's a scientist.
-No, no.

15
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:58,644  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
He's been in Minsk for eight years.
If he gets too much direct sunlight...

16
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:00,453  X1:275 X2:444 Y1:486 Y2:523
...he'll die.

17
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:02,447  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Okay, we'd better go.
-Yeah?

18
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:05,334  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
-So we'll see you guys tomorrow.
-All right, let's do it.

19
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:08,089  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
A five-hour flight with Charlie,
have a couple drinks...

20
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:10,644  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:523
...get under that blanket
and do what comes natural.

21
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:13,927  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's a blanket, Joe,
not a cloak of invisibility.

22
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,566  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
The One In Barbados

23
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:14,330  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:054 Y2:133
-Wow, this place is beautiful!
-Look at all these paleontologists!

24
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:18,693  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:054 Y2:133
I know. There are gonna be some
pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.

25
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:22,850  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:054 Y2:134
-My God, I can't believe you're here!
-I think I've been recognized.

26
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:27,133  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:054 Y2:133
-This happens all the time.
-Dr. Geller? I am such a huge fan.

27
00:02:27,335 --> 00:02:29,610  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
That never happens.

28
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:34,013  X1:074 X2:644 Y1:442 Y2:523
I've been following your career for years.
I can't wait for your keynote speech.

29
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:38,413  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:054 Y2:133
-Wow! This is very flattering.
-I would love your autograph.

30
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,645  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, sure.

31
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:43,534  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:448 Y2:523
-"Dear...?"
-Sarah.

32
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:48,769  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Sarah. I dig you."

33
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:52,846  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:054 Y2:134
-"Dr. Ross Geller."
-Oh, thank you so much.

34
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:57,088  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:054 Y2:134
Sure. Sarah, I'd like you to introduce you
to my colleague, Professor Wheeler.

35
00:02:57,255 --> 00:03:01,089  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:054 Y2:133
-And this is Joey Tribbiani.
-Are you a paleontologist?

36
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:04,412  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:054 Y2:128
No, God, no, no.
I'm an actor.

37
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:08,250  X1:077 X2:639 Y1:054 Y2:133
You probably recognize me from a
little show called The Days of Our Lives.

38
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:12,846  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:054 Y2:129
Dude, it's just Days of Our Lives.
There's no "the."

39
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:20,289  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:054 Y2:133
Okay, Ross. Boy, you.... Yeah.
No, no. I play Dr. Drake Ramoray.

40
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:25,973  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.
-You don't own a TV?

41
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:28,649  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's all your furniture pointed at?

42
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:33,734  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:523
David, can you help me?

43
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:37,251  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm trying to explain to Chandler
how a plane stays in the air.

44
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:40,054  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:442 Y2:523
Certainly. That's a combination
of Bernoulli's Principle...

45
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:42,968  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:523
-...and Newton's third law of motion.
-See?

46
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:46,650  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah. That's the same as,
"It has something to do with wind."

47
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:49,605  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm gonna go pick up a few things
for the trip.

48
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,484  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
I should go too. Now, tomorrow do you
want to share a cab to the airport...

49
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:55,213  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
...or should Mike and I meet you?

50
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:02,446  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:486 Y2:523
Mike? Who's Mike?

51
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:06,367  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Mike's your ex-boyfriend.
-That's right!

52
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:10,084  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, yeah.
Wow, I had totally forgotten about him.

53
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:15,932  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
-That's a blast from the past, huh?
-No, it's okay. Honest mistake.

54
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:18,729  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
It really doesn't mean anything.
I mean, you know...

55
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:21,773  X1:089 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:523
...Monica refers to Chandler as Richard
all the time.

56
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:26,814  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
-She does?
-Let's get you out of here.

57
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:34,607  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, at least you took me down
with you.

58
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:38,205  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm so sorry. I just--
I keep thinking about Mike.

59
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:42,010  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm crazy about David, and
we're having so much fun together.

60
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:46,134  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just--
That's gonna go away, right?

61
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,291  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well, I guess. In time.
-Yeah.

62
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,253  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, my feelings for Richard
are certainly gone.

63
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:56,813  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
You just did it again. Chandler. Your
feelings for Chandler are certainly gone.

64
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,168  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:523
Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up
on that Mike, huh?

65
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,213  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:486 Y2:523
I wouldn't read too much into it.

66
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:07,454  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Still, a girl calls you
by her ex-boyfriend's name...

67
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:10,573  X1:126 X2:594 Y1:442 Y2:523
-...that's not a good thing, right?
-Let me stop you there.

68
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:15,212  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because I think I see where this is going.
I'm not very good at giving advice.

69
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,094  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
See, if you want advice,
go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...

70
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:23,409  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
...for advice about pizza toppings
or a burning sensation when you pee.

71
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:28,613  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, I just wish there
was something I could do, you know?

72
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,331  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well, you know Phoebe--
-Seriously, we're gonna do this?

73
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:36,005  X1:094 X2:626 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, I just wish I could make her
forget about Mike already.

74
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:40,806  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
-Because his penis was too big.

75
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:47,805  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry. That's the kind of thing I do.

76
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:51,733  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
They broke up because Mike
didn't want to get married.

77
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:54,409  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
What if you let Phoebe know
you'd be open to marriage?

78
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:58,644  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's great. That's great.
I'll propose to her.

79
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:00,208  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

80
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:02,690  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was probably going to do it
at some point.

81
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,489  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:442 Y2:523
-No, I didn't mean now.
-Well, why not? It's brilliant.

82
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:08,414  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Goodbye, Mike.
We'll see you at the wedding, fella.

83
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,373  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, we probably won't invite you
to the wedding, but--"

84
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:14,925  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
-Well, you're welcome.

85
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:16,966  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
Glad I could help.

86
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:21,332  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
-How do you think I should propose?
-I'm pretending to read here.

87
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:23,087  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:29,214  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. How you doing?
Hey, how are you?

89
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:34,254  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
You said you were gonna wear a thong.
Where's the thong?

90
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:39,566  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:442 Y2:523
I didn't mean a thong.
I meant thongs.

91
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:43,054  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
You really should have been
more clear about that.

92
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:50,248  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're never gonna guess
who I just saw downstairs.

93
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,573  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
Britney Spears!

94
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,528  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yeah.
She never misses these conferences.

95
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,125  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
-Oh, my God!

96
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:00,774  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I know!
-Did you talk to him?

97
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:04,086  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, yeah. What am I gonna say
to Kenneth Schwartz?

98
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:08,214  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:442 Y2:523
You could say, "Hey, Kenny,
how come you're not Britney Spears?"

99
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:11,129  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You ready to go?
-You're gonna go now?

100
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:14,970  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I thought we could hang out.
-I can't. I have seminars all day.

101
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,171  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
I promised Ross
I'd look at his speech.

102
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:23,207  X1:090 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
But maybe we could have dinner later?
Out on the balcony? lt'll be romantic.

103
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,491  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
Will you wear a thong?

104
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,333  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:523
I will if you will.

105
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,170  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
You got yourself a very weird deal.

106
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,969  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm good. I have dinner plans.

107
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:39,325  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
-So you gonna be okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

108
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:43,408  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
I got tons of stuff I could do.
I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.

109
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,287  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joe, have you looked outside?

110
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:47,773  X1:281 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:523
No. Why?

111
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:52,644  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, man.
-There's an indoor pool.

112
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:54,294  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You could swim there.
-Yeah.

113
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:57,885  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:442 Y2:523
I wasn't gonna swim.
I was gonna dig a hole.

114
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:05,133  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
That Mike thing was interesting.
I don't know what's gonna happen...

115
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:09,732  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:523
-...with Phoebe and David.
-I do. Want a hint, huh?

116
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:11,414  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:488 Y2:523
I do.

117
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:15,006  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:488 Y2:523
I do.

118
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:18,248  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay, I'm sensing this is
some kind of wordplay...

119
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,373  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
...because you are pink
with barely controlled glee.

120
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:26,366  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:442 Y2:523
-David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
-What? Why?

121
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:29,768  X1:101 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:523
Because we were talking about ways
he could beat Mike...

122
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:32,130  X1:135 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and I told him Phoebe wanted
to get married.

123
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:34,166  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:486 Y2:523
Chandler, we have talked about this.

124
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:37,213  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
You are not supposed to give
people advice!

125
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:41,289  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:442 Y2:523
Couldn't you have made
some inappropriate joke?

126
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,889  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
I did! A penis one!

127
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,684  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:523
Just so I know, what was so wrong
about what I said?

128
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:49,005  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:523
They've only been going out
for a few weeks.

129
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:53,333  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.
I mean, she'll say no...

130
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:56,965  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:523
...David's heart will be broken,
it'll be too hard for them to recover...

131
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:59,928  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and then Phoebe will end up
alone again.

132
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,804  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:523
Man, that's some bad advice.

133
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,409  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, hey.
Thank God. You guys are here.

134
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:15,687  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:442 Y2:523
-What's going on?
-Everything is upside-down here.

135
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:21,532  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:523
It rains all day long and nobody
watches TV, and Ross is famous.

136
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:25,247  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't want to alarm anybody...

137
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:28,805  X1:117 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:523
...but Monica's hair is twice as big
as it was when we landed.

138
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,570  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. When I go places
with high humidity...

139
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:35,011  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
...it gets a little extra body, okay?

140
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:39,214  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:523
That's why our honeymoon photos
look like me and Diana Ross.

141
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,093  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll show you guys where to check in.

142
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:44,167  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, honey? Can you make sure
we get a king-size bed?

143
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:48,886  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh, and
see if they have a heart-shaped one.

144
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:51,973  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
And with mirrors on the ceiling.

145
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:55,730  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
And make sure our room
isn't next to theirs.

146
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,012  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, you guys are so lucky
you're here with people.

147
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,285  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, it's just
such a romantic place.

148
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:06,006  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just wish I could share it with a guy.

149
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:09,491  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Not Joey.
-Not Joey. No.

150
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:14,524  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I was just lusting after Chandler.
-Yeah, right.

151
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:21,327  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:523
So.... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.

152
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:22,934  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:523
Tonight?

153
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,611  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:442 Y2:523
Isn't an engagement ring
supposed to have a diamond?

154
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,809  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, there it is.

155
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,133  X1:072 X2:647 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yes, well, being a failed scientist doesn't
pay quite as well as you might think.

156
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:37,412  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's one-seventieth of a carat.

157
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:41,325  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
And the clarity is quite poor.

158
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:44,807  X1:312 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice.

159
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:49,172  X1:082 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Monica, can I talk to you for a second?
-Okay.

160
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,093  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:442 Y2:523
David's gonna propose
to Phoebe tonight.

161
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:54,093  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
See what happens
when you give people advice?

162
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:57,727  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well, I hope you told him not to.
-That would be advice!

163
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:00,731  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, fine. I'll handle this.

164
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,126  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Phoebe?
-Yeah?

165
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:09,608  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I need to talk to you.
-Are you leaving the Supremes?

166
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:20,768  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, my husband just gave
your boyfriend some very bad advice.

167
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:23,051  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
David's gonna propose to you tonight.

168
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:25,606  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow, really?

169
00:11:26,615 --> 00:11:28,606  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's fantastic!

170
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,208  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
What? Are you serious?
You want to marry him?

171
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,253  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What about Mike?
-Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?

172
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:37,531  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...

173
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,925  X1:092 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and force him down the aisle, okay?

174
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:42,689  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can just see it.
"Mike, do you take Phoebe?"

175
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:48,611  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know? It's every girl's dream.

176
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:52,133  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you really think marrying
someone else is the right answer?

177
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:56,408  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?
I love Mike-- David!

178
00:11:57,295 --> 00:12:00,048  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
David! I love David.

179
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:03,093  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
Don't look at me that way,
Roseanne Roseannadanna.

180
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:11,611  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
"By using CT scans and computer
imaging, we can, in a very real way...

181
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:16,212  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
...bring the Mesozoic Era
into the 21st century."

182
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:21,365  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's great. You'll be the hit
of the conference.

183
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,088  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:486 Y2:523
It'll be even better tomorrow...

184
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:25,769  X1:132 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
...because I won't be constantly
interrupted by Joey...

185
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:28,733  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
...checking to see if they put
chocolates on my pillow yet.

186
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:34,811  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey, guys.
-The chocolates aren't here.

187
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:36,852  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Damn it!

188
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:39,210  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
Ross just read me his speech.
It's fantastic.

189
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:42,566  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, is it on the computer?
Because I'd love to give it a read.

190
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:45,568  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you want to check your e-mail,
just ask.

191
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,805  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? May I?

192
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:55,125  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:442 Y2:523
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean,
when I signed up for dino week...

193
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:58,093  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
...nobody said anything
about it being monsoon season.

194
00:12:58,295 --> 00:13:01,731  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:446 Y2:523
-The wet season is June to December.
-It's not the time, Charlie.

195
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,086  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!

196
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:07,372  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
What, did someone outbid you
for the teapot?

197
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:12,373  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
Secret teapot.

198
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,969  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:442 Y2:523
Your computer. I don't know what--
Everything's gone.

199
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:17,166  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What do you mean?
-Must be a virus.

200
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:19,212  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think it erased your hard drive.

201
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,605  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?

202
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:24,050  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:442 Y2:523
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail
and I opened it.

203
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:27,810  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Why? Why would you open it?
-Well, it didn't say, "This is a virus."

204
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:31,648  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What did it say?
-"Nude--"

205
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:35,446  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:486 Y2:523
"Pictures of Anna Kournikova."

206
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,924  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm so sorry.
-What am I gonna do?

207
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,086  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:444 Y2:523
-My speech is gone!
-It's not gone.

208
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,815  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sure you printed out a copy.
You have a hard copy?

209
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,567  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I don't!

210
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:50,085  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, you must be pretty mad
at yourself right now.

211
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:01,205  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:442 Y2:523
-It's really gone?
-Yep.

212
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,208  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'd like to thank you guys
for coming down here...

213
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,253  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
...to complain about the rain
and ruin my career.

214
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:09,326  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I just feel awful.
-Yeah, you should.

215
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:14,444  X1:072 X2:647 Y1:442 Y2:523
Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? She's
never even won a major tournament.

216
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,294  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, I tried Billie Jean King, but--

217
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:22,926  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, you and Monica have
the same I'm-gonna-kill-you look.

218
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,167  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can usually make it go away
by kissing her.

219
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,885  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get out.

220
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:32,687  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, this happens all the time
to my computer at work.

221
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:34,453  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What do you do?
-I usually go...

222
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:36,890  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:442 Y2:523
...play Tetris on somebody else's
computer.

223
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:39,573  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't believe this is happening.

224
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:42,169  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:523
I have to give the keynote speech
tomorrow.

225
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:45,850  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have to stand up in front of all
these people. What am I gonna say?

226
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:48,125  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:523
You can use a speech I memorized
for auditions.

227
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:51,805  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't think your monologue from
Star Wars is gonna help me right now.

228
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:55,003  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ross, we can solve this.
I just heard your speech.

229
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:59,612  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:442 Y2:523
-We can re-create it. We've got all night.
-What, you really think we can do that?

230
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:03,085  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, wait.
Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.

231
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,564  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:442 Y2:523
Don't worry about that.
I mean, Ross needs you.

232
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:09,364  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
Rachel and I will stay and help
any way we can.

233
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:12,855  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right. Okay, let's do it.

234
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:17,487  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, I know we start by discussing
the shortcomings of carbon dating.

235
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:21,045  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
And then I move on to what is clearly
the defining moment...

236
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:25,606  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
...of the Mesozoic Era,
the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?

237
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:29,768  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:523
And then there's the overview
of the Triassic.

238
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:33,814  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
Any chance any of this happened
in a galaxy far, far away?

239
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,653  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hello?
-Okay, Mike?

240
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:46,323  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
Enough is enough.
You love Phoebe, and she loves you.

241
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:49,009  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
So get over your
l-never-wanna-get-married thing...

242
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:50,494  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and step up!

243
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:52,534  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who is this?

244
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:54,853  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:523
This is Monica, Phoebe's friend.

245
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,647  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Phoebe is back with David.

246
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:58,885  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:442 Y2:523
He's gonna propose,
and she's gonna say yes...

247
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,250  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but I know she really wants to be
with you.

248
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,732  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:523
He's gonna propose?

249
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:11,125  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I can't hear through all this damned hair!

250
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,365  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:523
If Phoebe wants to marry David,
she should.

251
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:17,333  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
Neither should you.

252
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:20,129  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:442 Y2:523
You don't tell me what to do.
I tell you what to do.

253
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:24,291  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:448 Y2:523
Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel
in Barbados.

254
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:26,605  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:442 Y2:523
And while I've got you,
you've got curly hair.

255
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:28,606  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
What do you do in the humidity?

256
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:31,734  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Damn it!

257
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,448  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Well, I hope you're happy.
-I hope you're happy too, honey.

258
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,325  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.

259
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:45,574  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
-That's what happens when you meddle.
-Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.

260
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:47,845  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, it's not.
She's still in love with Mike.

261
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:50,250  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:523
-There's no chance that will work?
-No, I called.

262
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:53,691  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:523
-It's not gonna happen.
-Meddler! Meddler!

263
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:55,852  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
If you hadn't meddled to start with...

264
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,575  X1:110 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
...then I wouldn't have had to go in
and meddle myself.

265
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:01,693  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:523
No matter how much we meddle,
we'll never be able to unmeddle...

266
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,608  X1:132 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
...the thing that you meddled up
in the first place!

267
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:07,331  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:488 Y2:523
This vacation sucks!

268
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:15,204  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm so bored.

269
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:19,007  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
Stupid rain. We can't do anything.

270
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:21,729  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, I brought some books.
We could read.

271
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,812  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.

272
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:26,766  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.

273
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:29,972  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, sir, these are
for the pharmaceutical convention.

274
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:35,050  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
You feel like going to a convention?

275
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,453  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:523
-We can't. We're not pharmacists.
-I know we're not...

276
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:44,326  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
...but Frank Madaio and Eva....

277
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:50,289  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Kate Miller.
-Kate Miller it is.

278
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:53,094  X1:270 X2:450 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay.
-Oh, good--

279
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:56,770  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:442 Y2:523
And that's the most sex
I'm gonna have this weekend.

280
00:17:56,935 --> 00:18:00,814  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, in that case,
should I make sure it's on real good?

281
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,046  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

282
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:13,724  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, and then you said that thing about
bringing the Mesozoic Era...

283
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,931  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
...into the 21st century.

284
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,687  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, yeah. That's it?

285
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,250  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God. We did it.

286
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:25,045  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
Actually, I did it, Ross. You remembered
shockingly little of your own speech.

287
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:29,289  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yes, but I did make a pyramid
out of the bath products.

288
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:34,528  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, this is amazing.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

289
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:39,446  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's a pretty necklace.

290
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,214  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

291
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:46,570  X1:105 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?
Champagne?

292
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:50,694  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,
we can fill the bottle with water...

293
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:53,130  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and put it back so they
don't charge you.

294
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,050  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, I love you.

295
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:02,090  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is such a cute picture of Emma.
And is this your son...

296
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:04,928  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
...or just some kid whose picture
you bring on vacation?

297
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:07,524  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:442 Y2:523
That's Ben, my son
from my first marriage.

298
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:09,168  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Your first marriage?
-Yeah.

299
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:11,690  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:486 Y2:523
You've been married more than once?

300
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:13,408  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

301
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:18,167  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:523
So why'd you break up?

302
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,370  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, it was--

303
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:27,652  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's complicated, you know?
She was...

304
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:30,443  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:448 Y2:523
-...gay.
-Oh, my God.

305
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:32,253  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is so cool!

306
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:35,289  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay.
Odd thing to get excited about.

307
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:38,765  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, it's just that I was engaged
to a guy who turned out to be gay.

308
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:40,806  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey! High-five!

309
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:45,168  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:442 Y2:523
Didn't you feel so stupid
that you didn't see the signs?

310
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,572  X1:074 X2:642 Y1:444 Y2:523
My fiancé was always going on
long weekends with his "tennis partner."

311
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:53,087  X1:084 X2:635 Y1:444 Y2:523
My wife had a workout friend she went
to the gym with every day for a year.

312
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,644  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:523
She didn't get any fitter.

313
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:58,653  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Everybody's like, "I knew all along."
-I know.

314
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:02,291  X1:102 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:523
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?
I mean, call, leave a note.

315
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:05,333  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Hi. Just dropped by
to say your wife's gay."

316
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:06,934  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I know.
-And then--

317
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:09,808  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:523
And then you try to make the best
of a bad situation...

318
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,773  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:523
...so you float the idea of a threesome.

319
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,246  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:486 Y2:523
I didn't do that.

320
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,809  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Me neither.

321
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:23,934  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.

322
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:27,087  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know. That old lady at the end
was ready to take you home.

323
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:30,247  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
Not enough pills in the world, Rach.

324
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,129  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
What about you, huh? You're the single
one. See anybody in there you like?

325
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,964  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, let's see. There was that
really big guy that I was talking to...

326
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,854  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
...with the really nice breasts.

327
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:48,563  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
But what about back home? Anything
going on there? Anybody you like?

328
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:53,204  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

329
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:58,171  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:442 Y2:523
-There is. You're blushing.
-No, I'm not blushing...

330
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,132  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:523
...and I'm sunburned.

331
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:02,883  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
From, you know, the rain.

332
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,847  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
You like someone. Tell me who.

333
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,210  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Tell me who it is. Come on.
-No. Joey.

334
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,935  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
Who do you like?
You're not getting away that easy.

335
00:21:10,095 --> 00:21:11,813  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Who do you like?
-Joey, come on!

336
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:16,366  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
It doesn't matter, you know?
It's not like anything's gonna happen.

337
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:20,733  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
What? Why not?
Rach, who can you not get?

338
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:29,893  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. Okay.
You really want to know who it is?

339
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:32,768  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah. Who is it?
-Do you?

340
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:36,571  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, hey.
-I just left you a message.

341
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:38,731  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:523
Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite...

342
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:41,409  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:523
...but now that you're here,
we could have that dinner.

343
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:45,164  X1:103 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Right! Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?

344
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,684  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yep! We got it. We got it.
Thank you so much.

345
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:49,686  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I had a great time.
-Yeah.

346
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:52,170  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:442 Y2:523
This isn't over,
because I really want to know--

347
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,728  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Later. Later.

348
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:56,685  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So shall we?
-Yeah.

349
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,687  X1:263 X2:454 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay.
-Good night.

350
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:00,846  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:523
Good night.

351
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:10,167  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay, good night.
-Good night, Ross.

352
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,690  X1:169 X2:551 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't believe she's gonna
say yes to David.

353
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:18,891  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
She's clearly in love with Mike.

354
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:22,770  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, it's very hard to take you
seriously when you look like that.

355
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:32,014  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe, I have something I want to say.

356
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:34,854  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
I cannot watch this. Let's go.

357
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:37,410  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think we have time.
Have you heard him talk?

358
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:42,490  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Phoebe, I would be honored if--"
Spit it out, David!

359
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:45,723  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:523
Phoebe.

360
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:55,010  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're an amazing woman, and the time
we spent apart was unbearable.

361
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:58,485  X1:074 X2:646 Y1:444 Y2:523
Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minsk
didn't help.

362
00:22:58,695 --> 00:22:59,969  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

363
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:06,005  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:442 Y2:523
But, well, now that we're together
again, I don't ever want to be apart.

364
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:10,054  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:488 Y2:523
So to that end....

365
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:16,366  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, my God, Mike.
-It's David, actually.

366
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:18,372  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, Mike's here.

367
00:23:19,455 --> 00:23:21,047  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, hey, Mike.

368
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:24,405  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hi, David.

369
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:27,813  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chandler. Monic-- Oh!

370
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:33,254  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's the humidity!

371
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:39,410  X1:172 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi, Phoebe.
-What are you doing here?

372
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:42,012  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have a question I need to ask you.

373
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:45,764  X1:142 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have a question I was kind of
gonna ask her myself.

374
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:50,127  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, I understand, but before you do,
she really needs to hear this.

375
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:53,653  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

376
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:57,694  X1:100 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Would you care for my seat as well?
-Actually, yeah, that'd be great.

377
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:01,046  X1:082 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.

378
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:13,893  X1:214 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe, I love you.

379
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:16,734  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:523
I've missed you so much
these last few months.

380
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:19,130  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought we were apart
for a good reason...

381
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,684  X1:076 X2:644 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but I realized that there was no reason
good enough...

382
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:25,245  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
...to keep me from spending
the rest of my life with you.

383
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:28,891  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
Kind of steps on the toes
of what I was going to say.

384
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,003  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, David,
but she really has to know this.

385
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:36,366  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
All right, but after this,
I want to see you outside.

386
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:38,127  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:523
If the rain stops.

387
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:44,610  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:523
You're the most incredible woman
I've ever met.

388
00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:50,005  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
How could I lose you?
Now, I don't actually have a ring.

389
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:53,412  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I have a ring.
-I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.

390
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,772  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:486 Y2:523
But, Phoebe...

391
00:24:57,575 --> 00:24:59,964  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
...will you marry me?

392
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:04,654  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

393
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:16,646  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
I love you, but I never needed
a proposal from you.

394
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:19,210  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:523
I just needed to know
we were headed somewhere.

395
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:24,205  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
-That we had a future.
-We can have any future you want.

396
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,253  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.

397
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:36,089  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
David, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

398
00:25:36,255 --> 00:25:40,134  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:486 Y2:523
Just so I know, if I had asked first...?

399
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:45,648  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, I might have said yes,
but that would've been wrong.

400
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:48,566  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
Please, you don't have to explain.

401
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:51,533  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, perhaps if I hadn't
gone to Minsk...

402
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:56,450  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
...things would have worked out for us,
and I wouldn't have ruined my career.

403
00:25:56,615 --> 00:25:59,732  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or lost that toe to frostbite.

404
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:01,734  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
It was a good trip.

405
00:26:05,455 --> 00:26:07,844  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Is it okay if I hug you now?
-Oh, yes.

406
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:14,207  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because of our meddling! All right?

407
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:26,568  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.
I could just lie here all day.

408
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:28,885  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, I know.

409
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:35,010  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
-So glad we got adjoining rooms.

410
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:40,406  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
-The sun is out!
-Hey! Remember when I had corneas?

411
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:42,287  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
Go to the pool and reserve chairs.

412
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:46,613  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I will get the magazines and the lotion.
-Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.

413
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,646  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No!
-Damn it!

414
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:52,175  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
Walls are pretty thin, guys.

415
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:02,450  X1:090 X2:630 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Then we have to weigh the data from
recent MRI scans and DNA testing...

416
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:08,323  X1:087 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
...which call into question information
gathered from years of carbon dating."

417
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:12,130  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look at the woman sitting out
by the pool getting tan.

418
00:27:12,295 --> 00:27:15,844  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:442 Y2:523
She's all leathery and wrinkled.
I'm so jealous!

419
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:20,208  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Finally, factor in the profusion
of new species recently discovered.

420
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,491  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:523
Giganotosaurus.

421
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:26,730  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Argentinosaurus. "
-Not to mention Coldsaurus.

422
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:33,329  X1:085 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not
even gonna discuss the carnivores.

423
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:35,087  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
Their heads are already too big.

424
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:39,043  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
Which is ironic, considering
their stunted cerebral development."

425
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,649  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

426
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:49,688  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:442 Y2:523
"But all kidding aside,
in much the same way...

427
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:54,565  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that Homo ergaster is thought to be a
separate species from Homo erectus...."

428
00:27:57,975 --> 00:28:01,172  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What?
-He said "erectus. "

429
00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:05,613  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You're kidding, right?
-No, he really said it.

430
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:09,129  X1:150 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:523
"And while there are certainly
vast differences...

431
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:13,925  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
...between these Mesozoic fossils
and the example of Homo erectus...."

432
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:17,734  X1:288 X2:430 Y1:488 Y2:523
Erectus?

433
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:20,125  X1:296 X2:419 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Homo.
-Right.

434
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:27,292  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:442 Y2:523
"In a very real way, we can bring
the Mesozoic Era into the 21st century."

435
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,730  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

436
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:37,006  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Really great.
-Oh, thanks, guys.

437
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:42,249  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
I thought it was wonderful.
Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.

438
00:28:42,415 --> 00:28:47,967  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, the ideas you put forth,
and from someone so young and....

439
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:56,293  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, now we're just holding hands.

440
00:28:56,575 --> 00:29:00,284  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:442 Y2:523
Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.
That was really great.

441
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:03,015  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah. Oh, and so funny.

442
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:07,208  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Take it easy.
-All right, thanks. Thanks so much.

443
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,889  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't tell you how much it means
that you were here.

444
00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:11,886  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:523
You kidding?
We wouldn't have missed it.

445
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,013  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm back.

446
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,772  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Well, excuse me?

447
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:24,566  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well?
-You were incredible.

448
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:26,088  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
You blew them away.

449
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:30,004  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't tell you how great it was
to look in the crowd and see your face.

450
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:33,645  X1:108 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, did you know you were
mouthing the words along with me?

451
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,368  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I was not.
-No, it's okay.

452
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:38,408  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
It made me feel like a rock star.

453
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,647  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.

454
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:44,813  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, I better not find you naked
in my hotel room.

455
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:50,891  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:486 Y2:523
Look, I took it too far.

456
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:59,687  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:523
I can't believe it's raining again.
It's so unfair.

457
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:02,528  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, on the bright side,
now we won't have to see...

458
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:06,005  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:523
...all these paleontologists
with their shirts off.

459
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:10,130  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:523
Not you guys.

460
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:12,975  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
You've got it going on.

461
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:18,808  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What will we do today?
-They have a game room downstairs.

462
00:30:18,975 --> 00:30:20,454  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.

463
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,452  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ping-Pong?
Honey, they have Ping-Pong.

464
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:24,890  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Let's play.
-I don't think so.

465
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:28,245  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Why not?
-You know how competitive you get.

466
00:30:28,415 --> 00:30:31,407  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
And while I say it's cute,
others disagree, and I'm lying.

467
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:35,563  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm not always that bad.
-Oh, yeah?

468
00:30:35,735 --> 00:30:38,044  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:523
What happened when we played
last time?

469
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:40,683  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
I punched you.

470
00:30:40,895 --> 00:30:43,568  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:448 Y2:523
-And?
-Phoebe.

471
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,651  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
-And?
-I clunked your heads together.

472
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:07,807  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:444 Y2:523
-There you are.
-Hey. Listen.

473
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:11,445  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
As soon as it stops raining,
we have got to go snorkeling.

474
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:15,204  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
Some kid told me about this sea turtle.
If you blow bubbles in his face...

475
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,650  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:523
...he chases you.

476
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:22,133  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm running
a discussion group all afternoon.

477
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:24,809  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:523
That's okay.
I'll find someone else to do it.

478
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,733  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:523
I'd do it alone, but...

479
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:30,251  X1:150 X2:570 Y1:442 Y2:523
...I don't know what happens
if the sea turtle catches you.

480
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:33,006  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:486 Y2:523
You know, I feel so bad.

481
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:35,928  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:442 Y2:523
I haven't seen you this whole trip.
Especially last night--

482
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:39,405  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:523
Don't worry about it. It was fine.
I had the best time with Rachel.

483
00:31:39,575 --> 00:31:43,363  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just felt bad for you, stuck
in that room working on Ross' speech.

484
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:46,567  X1:075 X2:641 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.

485
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:51,049  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, well, at least
we're both having fun, right?

486
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:55,173  X1:075 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Is it weird that it's not with each other?
-Yeah.

487
00:31:55,335 --> 00:31:56,973  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:523
A little bit, yeah.

488
00:32:01,535 --> 00:32:03,810  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think we need to talk.

489
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:07,574  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:486 Y2:523
Yeah, I think we do.

490
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:11,693  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
About what?

491
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:17,328  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Come on, you guys, it'll be fun!
-All right.

492
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:21,090  X1:079 X2:641 Y1:446 Y2:523
-I'll play if we don't keep score.
-Well, then how do we know who wins?

493
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:26,686  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Nobody wins.
-So we're just four losers. Super.

494
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,129  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Well, I'm not playing with her.
-I'm out.

495
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:32,047  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'll play you.
-Okay.

496
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:34,649  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You don't know what you're doing.
-She gets crazy.

497
00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:37,329  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
This scar? That's from Pictionary.

498
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,888  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think I'll be all right.

499
00:32:41,055 --> 00:32:44,730  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You want to volley a bit for serve?
-Sure, if you want to.

500
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:53,891  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.

501
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:58,485  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:523
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.

502
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:01,166  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You ready to play?
-Hell, yeah.

503
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:06,893  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Did you know this about him?
-No idea. I thought he was soft like you.

504
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:09,815  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Want to make it more interesting?
-How much you thinking?

505
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:11,733  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Ten bucks a game?
-Make it 50.

506
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:13,448  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I'll make it 100.
-One thousand--

507
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:15,486  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay!

508
00:33:16,175 --> 00:33:18,564  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
We'll flip to see who goes first.
You got a quarter?

509
00:33:18,855 --> 00:33:21,608  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
No. Either of you girls got a quarter?

510
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:25,249  X1:124 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:523
Honey, try to focus the trash talk
on him.

511
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:29,692  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Monica, you call it.
-Heads. No, tails! Heads!

512
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:32,204  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Tails.
-Oh, what are the chances?

513
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:38,813  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:523
-My point!
-Oh, no, I don't think so.

514
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:42,564  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Standard rules: If at any time a player
uses his nonracket-bearing hand...

515
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:45,647  X1:141 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
...to touch the playing surface,
he or she forfeits the point.

516
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:50,926  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
He was a lawyer.

517
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:54,931  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
All the East Coast
is having beautiful weather.

518
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:57,046  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
In New York, it's 72 and sunny.

519
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,612  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Weather bitch.

520
00:34:01,695 --> 00:34:03,287  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's open.

521
00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:05,934  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi, Joe.
-Hey.

522
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:10,329  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What? Is everything okay?
-Charlie and I broke up.

523
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:12,526  X1:281 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:523
No. Why?

524
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:15,374  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, she said
we have nothing in common.

525
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:17,406  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's crazy.

526
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:20,091  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, it's not.
We have nothing in common.

527
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:23,285  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Yeah, that's true.
-Yeah.

528
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:26,373  X1:104 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
I mean, she should be with someone
more like Ross.

529
00:34:26,535 --> 00:34:29,686  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, I mean he uses
all those big words too.

530
00:34:29,855 --> 00:34:33,643  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Man, smart people are dull.
-Well, hey!

531
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:36,005  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, Rach.

532
00:34:37,095 --> 00:34:42,772  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
I feel so stupid, you know? Why do I
keep going after the wrong girls?

533
00:34:42,975 --> 00:34:45,489  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:523
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, come on.

534
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:50,854  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie.
It's like.... What the hell's my problem?

535
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:53,051  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just....

536
00:34:56,735 --> 00:35:02,412  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay. Maybe you're not
always going after the wrong girl.

537
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:05,527  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm telling you, Rach,
Charlie is not right for me.

538
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:08,613  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:523
-I'm not talking about her.
-Well, then, who?

539
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,414  X1:071 X2:648 Y1:488 Y2:523
The waitress I went out with last month?

540
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:14,646  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:523
-You know what? Forget it.
-No, no, no, no.

541
00:35:14,815 --> 00:35:17,090  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Who are you talking about?
-No, I don't--

542
00:35:17,255 --> 00:35:20,008  X1:173 X2:547 Y1:442 Y2:523
I actually don't know who
I'm talking about, so....

543
00:35:20,415 --> 00:35:22,406  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Okay.
-Yeah.

544
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:25,328  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I'm gonna go see
if I can get a room for tonight.

545
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:29,084  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:442 Y2:523
-And I'll see you later.
-Yeah, sure. Okay.

546
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:56,284  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You like me?
-Okay.

547
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:59,453  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Let's not make a big thing about this.
-It's a huge thing!

548
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:01,725  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, not working with me, Joe.

549
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:07,123  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:442 Y2:523
Look, here's the thing.
Lately, I have been having thoughts.

550
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:09,531  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
Musings, if you will.

551
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:13,170  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Well, for how long?
-Oh, only like a month.

552
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:14,967  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:448 Y2:523
-A month?
-Well--

553
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:20,454  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:442 Y2:523
Dial it down. Listen, maybe they're
crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.

554
00:36:20,655 --> 00:36:23,931  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have been thinking about,
you know, us.

555
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:28,812  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay, dial it up a little.
-Oh, you're right. Okay.

556
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:30,454  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I just have a question.
-Shoot.

557
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,931  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm not trying to do anything.

558
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:37,292  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's just, we have such a good time
when we're together, you know?

559
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:41,528  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:523
And I mean, aren't you just
a little curious what it would be like?

560
00:36:41,735 --> 00:36:45,489  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:523
Am I curious?
I mean, I'm as curious as...

561
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:48,011  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:523
...George!

562
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:51,845  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Who?
-Curious George!

563
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:54,654  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, the monkey and the guy
with the yellow hat.

564
00:36:54,855 --> 00:36:57,164  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Of course. I remember.
-He had a paper route.

565
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:59,087  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:486 Y2:523
Yeah, he did.

566
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:02,605  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
-See, this is what I'm talking about.
-No, I know. We're great!

567
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:05,414  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.

568
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:09,369  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can't it just happen a little bit?

569
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:14,692  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:442 Y2:523
-No! It can't happen at all!
-Why not?

570
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:18,404  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because, look, no one wants
this to happen more than me, okay?

571
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:21,851  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have gone over this moment
in my head 100 times...

572
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:25,246  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and not once did I ever say no.

573
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,653  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:486 Y2:523
I couldn't do it to Ross.

574
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,173  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:448 Y2:523
-But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
-I know. I know...

575
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:40,648  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:442 Y2:523
...but I've thought about it a lot
since then, and it just wouldn't be right.

576
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,728  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

577
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:49,530  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry too.

578
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:53,130  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.
-No, no.

579
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:55,251  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.

580
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:58,009  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Like you said, it's no big deal.
-It's not a big deal.

581
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:00,092  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No big deal.
-It's so not a big deal.

582
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:03,526  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'll see you later. All right, hey.
-Okay, great.

583
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:24,211  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay--

584
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:40,527  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, I'm sorry, I think--
I think that may have missed the table.

585
00:38:40,775 --> 00:38:42,367  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Oh, do you?
-Yeah.

586
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:43,644  X1:287 X2:433 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Do you?
-Yeah.

587
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,573  X1:287 X2:433 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Do you?
-Yeah!

588
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:49,526  X1:092 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You really find this attractive on him?
-Oh, yeah.

589
00:38:49,735 --> 00:38:53,489  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
Are you telling me you're not even
a little turned on by Monica right now?

590
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:03,414  X1:076 X2:643 Y1:448 Y2:523
This is the first time in our marriage that
I've felt like the more attractive one.

591
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,450  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:523
All right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.

592
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:09,010  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
Knock that dog off her head.

593
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,773  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Damn it!
-I sleep with him!

594
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:18,970  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Game point.
-Don't get too cocky.

595
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:20,614  X1:137 X2:571 Y1:486 Y2:523
Remember, I won the last one.

596
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,767  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, by the way,
how did that feel, losing to a girl?

597
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:26,773  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
You should look in the mirror
before you call yourself that.

598
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:34,325  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No! No! No!
-And that's how it's done.

599
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:36,163  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okey-dokey.

600
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:40,209  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
You've each won a game, and I've lost
what's felt like a year of my life.

601
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,172  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
Everybody goes home a winner.

602
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,047  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Best of three?
-That's what I'm thinking.

603
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:49,010  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
Should I use my invisibility
to fight crime or for evil?

604
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:52,444  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Serve the ball, chump.
-"Serve the ball, chump."

605
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:56,170  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.
Better comebacks.

606
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:01,089  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm just saying,
I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.

607
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:05,083  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you ever want to get away
from the city, well, that'd be...

608
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:07,851  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:482 Y2:523
...just nifty.

609
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:14,525  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I've kind of got a lot on my plate
right now.

610
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:18,927  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
Not that I wouldn't love a weekend
in the country with a strange man.

611
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:23,454  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Jarvis?
-Oh, you're back.

612
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:28,528  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
-This is my wife, Nancy.
-Well, get out!

613
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:33,092  X1:095 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Ross? Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Yes, please.

614
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:38,534  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, what's going on?

615
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:44,084  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, Joey and I broke up.

616
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:49,734  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, my God. What happened?
-Joey is a great guy...

617
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:52,363  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:523
...but we're just--
We're so different.

618
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:55,732  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, like, during your speech,
he kept laughing at "Homo erectus. "

619
00:40:55,935 --> 00:40:58,290  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
I knew that was him!

620
00:40:59,815 --> 00:41:03,603  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:523
Anyway, I just....
I think it's for the best.

621
00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:08,692  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey. Hey, you okay?
-I guess.

622
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:12,851  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:523
There was....

623
00:41:13,815 --> 00:41:18,764  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:444 Y2:523
There was another reason that I thought
it was time to end it with Joey.

624
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:25,125  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
I started to realize that I was
having feelings for someone else.

625
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:29,128  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, Geller.
Last day of the conference.

626
00:41:29,335 --> 00:41:31,530  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what happens
to the keynote speaker.

627
00:41:31,735 --> 00:41:34,613  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:523
Professor Klarik, we're in the middle
of a conversation here.

628
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:39,007  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Can't you throw him in the pool later?
-Or we could throw you both in now.

629
00:41:39,215 --> 00:41:42,491  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, gentlemen, please.
Aren't we a little old for this?

630
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:45,215  X1:121 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:523
I mean, we're scientists, all right?
We're academics...

631
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:49,334  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and most importantly,
you will have to catch us first.

632
00:41:49,495 --> 00:41:51,565  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go! Go! Go!

633
00:42:00,495 --> 00:42:02,804  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, so it's tied again,
41 to 41 .

634
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,527  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Okay, look, enough is enough.
-No.

635
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:11,569  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I just have two more points to beat him.
-Monica, that was also true an hour ago!

636
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:13,248  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
I mean, please, look at you.

637
00:42:13,455 --> 00:42:17,733  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
Your hand is blistered, you can
barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!

638
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:22,009  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:442 Y2:523
You've already proven
you're just as good as he is.

639
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:25,053  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
We missed our dinner reservations,
so let's just go upstairs...

640
00:42:25,215 --> 00:42:28,127  X1:106 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
...order room service, take a shower
and shave your head!

641
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:32,807  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:442 Y2:523
I can't just walk away.
I've put in four hours.

642
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,366  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
You knew this about me
when you married me.

643
00:42:35,535 --> 00:42:38,368  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:523
You agreed to take me in sickness
and in health.

644
00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:40,969  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, this is my sickness!

645
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:44,690  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What about the obsessive cleaning?
-That's just good sense.

646
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:54,052  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You okay?
-No, honey, I'm okay.

647
00:42:54,255 --> 00:42:58,009  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.
No shaking. No shaking.

648
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:04,805  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God. I can't play.

649
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,324  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So you forfeit?
-Mike wins?

650
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,565  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:486 Y2:523
I can't believe it. I lost.

651
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:18,010  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:448 Y2:523
-No, you didn't.
-What?

652
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:21,207  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Because I'm gonna play for you.
-You can't do that.

653
00:43:21,415 --> 00:43:24,566  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's okay.
I don't care which of them I beat.

654
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:29,004  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay, we're taking that paddle home,
mister.

655
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,730  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Honey, you don't have to do this.
-Yes, I do.

656
00:43:34,935 --> 00:43:37,130  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
I may not understand why
you have to win so badly...

657
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:39,763  X1:150 X2:570 Y1:442 Y2:523
...but if it's important to you,
it's important to me.

658
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:41,527  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because I love you.

659
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:45,805  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
But you suck.

660
00:43:46,975 --> 00:43:48,806  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:523
You're welcome, sweetheart.

661
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:52,044  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:523
All right, let's get this over with.
Sudden death.

662
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:55,969  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Whoever wins this point, wins.
-Okay.

663
00:43:59,455 --> 00:44:04,290  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Oh, my God. You're good.
-It's like watching porn.

664
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:12,369  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:486 Y2:523
And that's how it's done.

665
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:17,525  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That was so amazing.

666
00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:19,447  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, when did you--?

667
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,608  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hold on, I almost forgot. Loser.

668
00:44:26,295 --> 00:44:29,492  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
-When did you stop sucking?
-I never sucked. I just didn't want you...

669
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:31,611  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
-...to know how good I was.
-Why?

670
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:33,686  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I don't know.
-Well, this is so great.

671
00:44:33,855 --> 00:44:36,415  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Now we can enter doubles tournaments.
-That's why.

672
00:44:45,775 --> 00:44:47,493  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:523
-They still looking for us?
-Yeah.

673
00:44:47,655 --> 00:44:50,374  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
The bartender said they split up
into two search parties.

674
00:44:50,535 --> 00:44:52,890  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
The herbivores and the carnivores.

675
00:44:54,175 --> 00:44:57,485  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know, we, as a group,
are not the coolest.

676
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:59,452  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, look out.

677
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:09,006  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I don't think they saw us.
-I don't think they did.

678
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:19,454  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:482 Y2:523
So I started to tell you something earlier.

679
00:45:21,175 --> 00:45:26,488  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:444 Y2:523
There was another reason that I realized
it was time to end it with Joey.

680
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:31,604  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
I kind of realized I was starting
to have feelings...

681
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,891  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:523
...for someone else.

682
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:39,409  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:523
And can I ask who?

683
00:45:40,495 --> 00:45:42,486  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think you know.

684
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:48,888  X1:075 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
I think I know too, but I've been really
wrong about this stuff in the past, so....

685
00:46:06,255 --> 00:46:10,806  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I'm sorry, we can't.
-All right. All right.

686
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:14,485  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, you just went out
with my best friend, you know?

687
00:46:14,695 --> 00:46:18,290  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just think it would be a really,
really bad idea.

688
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:24,653  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or not. I mean--

689
00:47:00,615 --> 00:47:01,650  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

690
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:53,924  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:054 Y2:133
