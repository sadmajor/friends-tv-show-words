1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,499  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:523
Guys! Guys! I've got great
news. Guess what.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,932  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Monica's pregnant!
-Really?

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,291  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let's get past the moment.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,252  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:442 Y2:523
-What's your news?
-Thank you.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,571  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
I got a job in advertising.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,652  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, that's incredible!

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,977  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
Gosh, what's the pay like?

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,615  X1:198 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, come on, people.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,896  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:486 Y2:523
If I don't know who makes the most...

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,257  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
...how do I know who
I like the most? Hi, Joey.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,617  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
It pays nothing. It's an internship.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,617  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:523
We have interns at Days of Our Lives.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,732  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:442 Y2:523
Right. So it'll be the same,
except less sex with you.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,696  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:442 Y2:523
What do you think they'll
have you do there?

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,892  X1:134 X2:587 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's a training program, but they
hire the people they like.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,933  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
-That's great!
-There's gonna be some grunt work...

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,570  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
...which will stink. A grown man
getting people coffee is humiliating.

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,213  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
Humiliating and noble.

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,571  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,250  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, if I didn't
already have a job...

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,411  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I would've been good in advertising.

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,214  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:523
Ross, you did not come up with:
"Got Milk?"

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,297  X1:233 X2:473 Y1:486 Y2:523
Yes, I did! I did!

24
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,814  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:486 Y2:523
I should've written it down.

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,977  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
The One With the Mugging

26
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,337  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:054 Y2:134
Where's Chandler? I want to wish
him good luck on his first day.

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,895  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:054 Y2:089
And I smelled bacon.

28
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,179  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:448 Y2:523
-He just left.
-Who did?

29
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,295  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:054 Y2:129
Joey, you're never gonna
believe it! She called!

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,979  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:444 Y2:523
-She did?
-You got it!

31
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,732  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I did?
-What is she talking about?

32
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,056  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:054 Y2:095
I don't know, but it sounds great!

33
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,290  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:054 Y2:133
Your agent called.
You got that audition!

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,774  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:054 Y2:128
-With Leonard Hayes?
-Yes!

35
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,489  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:054 Y2:133
Oh, my God, that is great!
It's for a play on Broadway.

36
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,619  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:054 Y2:128
And in a real theater. Not that little
one underneath the deli like last time.

37
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,378  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:054 Y2:128
-Is it a good play?
-It must be.

38
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,976  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:054 Y2:134
I read it and didn't
understand a single word!

39
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,774  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:054 Y2:133
-Leonard Hayes is starring in it.
-Yeah, and directing.

40
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,335  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:523
He was so good in
that movie of Macbeth.

41
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,169  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:054 Y2:133
-You saw that?
-No, but I saw the previews.

42
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,412  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:054 Y2:094
They played it right before Jackass.

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,857  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:442 Y2:523
-He's done some amazing work.
-Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,136  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:054 Y2:094
I loved him in those phone commercials.

45
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,054  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:054 Y2:133
When the monkey hits him in the face
with the giant rubber phone....

46
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,057  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:523
Maybe the monkey
will be at the audition.

47
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,855  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:442 Y2:523
Don't make me more nervous
than I already am!

48
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,099  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Good morning.
-Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?

49
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,093  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, no, no. I'm an intern,
just like you guys.

50
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,651  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:523
Except for the tie, the briefcase
and the fact that I can rent a car.

51
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,578  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
Seriously, you're an intern?

52
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,693  X1:101 X2:619 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm heading in a new career direction
and you gotta start at the bottom.

53
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,249  X1:307 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dude.

54
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,654  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:442 Y2:523
I know I'm a little older than you guys,
but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.

55
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,496  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:488 Y2:523
The comedian. USO.

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,416  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:523
It's U.S.A., sir.

57
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,972  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, these are the producers.

58
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,973  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
And as you probably already
know, this is Leonard Hayes.

59
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,775  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
It is so amazing to meet you.
I am such a big fan of your work.

60
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,699  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:442 Y2:523
I've been blessed with
a lot of great roles.

61
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,810  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
Tell me about it, huh?
"Unlimited nights and weekends!"

62
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,091  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
Are you making fun of me?
Because I am not a sellout.

63
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,860  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:442 Y2:523
I didn't do it for money.
I believe in those phones!

64
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,218  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:523
I almost lost a cousin because
of bad wireless service.

65
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,379  X1:087 X2:633 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, I wasn't making fun of you. I think
you were great in those commercials.

66
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,814  X1:295 X2:425 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Really?
-Yeah.

67
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,938  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, I do bring a certain
credibility to the role.

68
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,137  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are you kidding? When they shoot
you out of that cannon--

69
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,499  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Hang up that phone!"

70
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,697  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:448 Y2:523
-One take.
-Wow.

71
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,778  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:444 Y2:523
-So shall we read?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

72
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,819  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
Top of Act 2. This is my entrance.
You got it?

73
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,734  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:523
What the hell are you still doing here?

74
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,495  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I think you know.
-Bastard!

75
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,056  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
I am what you made me.
You know what? I could go right now.

76
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,820  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Go! Go!
-I can't.

77
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,529  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, I want to, Long Pause...

78
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,656  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:486 Y2:523
...but I can't.

79
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,291  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:442 Y2:523
So sorry. You're not supposed
to say "long pause."

80
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,092  X1:132 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh! Oh, I thought that was your
character's name. You know?

81
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,616  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought you were, like, an Indian
or something, you know, with the....

82
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,259  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
No. Thank you so much for coming in.
We appreciate it. Thank you.

83
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,172  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:523
You don't want me to do it again?

84
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,898  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I could do an accent.
-No.

85
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,929  X1:118 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, Southern.
"I could go right now, mon!" Huh?

86
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,655  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
My God in heaven.

87
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,890  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, hang on. Leonard, can
we talk to you for a moment?

88
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,976  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yes? You've got to be kidding.
He can't act.

89
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,818  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't care if you think he's hot.

90
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,451  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you want to sleep with him,
do it on your own time. This is a play.

91
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,816  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
If you insist on this...

92
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,936  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I will call my agent so fast...

93
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,775  X1:094 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
...on a cell phone connection so clear,
he's gonna think I'm next door!

94
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,931  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hi, thank you so much for
whispering for my benefit.

95
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,372  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
Tell me what I did wrong. I'd love to
work on it and try it again for you.

96
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,656  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:523
And also, how you doing?

97
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,292  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
Give me another chance.
I really want to get better. Please?

98
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,896  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
If you want to come back today...

99
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,732  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
-...here are my notes. Ready?
-Yeah.

100
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,412  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You're in your head. Thinking too much.
-I really doubt that.

101
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,169  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:442 Y2:523
No, no. It's that you're not
connected with anything in your body.

102
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,496  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:442 Y2:523
There's no urgency.
The scene is a struggle.

103
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,050  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's a race.
Also, what you did was horizontal.

104
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,018  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.

105
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,250  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:442 Y2:523
And don't learn the words.
Let the words learn you.

106
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,856  X1:084 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:523
Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?

107
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,651  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

108
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,495  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:523
I can't. I've got a date
with that waitress, Katie.

109
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,697  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:523
I know we've only gone out,
like, twice, but I don't know...

110
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,615  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:523
-...I have a good feeling about her.
-Oh, I hear divorce bells.

111
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,380  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
Give me your wallets,
and there won't be a problem.

112
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,258  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-I have a gun.

113
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,497  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, relax, Phoebe.
Just stay calm.

114
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,735  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, I can't find my wallet!

115
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,169  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:448 Y2:523
-All right, lady, now give me your purse.
-No.

116
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,293  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:442 Y2:523
What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd
be my death, Phoebe Buffay!

117
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,859  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Lowell, is that you?
-Phoebe?

118
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,531  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, my God!
-Unbelievable! Oh, my God!

119
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,978  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:523
I'm sorry. Ross, this is my old friend,
Lowell, from the streets!

120
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,449  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Lowell, Ross.
-Ross, nice to meet you.

121
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,696  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, a real pleasure.

122
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,935  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's been so long! Oh, so long.

123
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,450  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I can't believe you're still doing this.
-I know. But I quit smoking.

124
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,332  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
Good for you.

125
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,138  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
You look like you're doing well.

126
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,808  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
I guess your mugging days
are behind you.

127
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,217  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
Phoebe, you used to mug people?

128
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,458  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
Excuse me, Ross,
old friends catching up.

129
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,970  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:442 Y2:523
-How'd the audition go?
-They want to see me again, but...

130
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,779  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
...Leonard Hayes did not like me.

131
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,455  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What happened?
-He said I wasn't urgent enough.

132
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:00,217  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:523
Everything I did was horizontal,
and I should be more vertical.

133
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,773  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
-He said that I should think less.
-Well, so far so good.

134
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,016  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, I'm old!

135
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,209  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's wrong?

136
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,574  X1:106 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
I am so much older than these other
interns. I can't compete with them.

137
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,099  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
So you're a little older.

138
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,013  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look at the positive.
You have all this life experience.

139
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,533  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yes, but I don't think life experience
is gonna help me with these.

140
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,417  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow! It's like they're on fire!

141
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,049  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What are they?
-Prototype sneakers.

142
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,609  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:523
I need ideas on how to sell them.
Which I can't do...

143
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,294  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
...because no self-respecting
adult would ever wear these.

144
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,013  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll give you $500 for them.

145
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,852  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What am I supposed to do?
-Come on, sneakers are easy.

146
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,569  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You wear them all the time.
-They're not called sneakers anymore.

147
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,417  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:442 Y2:523
They're called "kicks" or "skids."
I think I heard somebody say "slorps."

148
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,495  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:442 Y2:523
They've got wheels that pop out from
the bottom so you can roll around...

149
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,936  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
...because apparently
walking is too much exercise.

150
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,298  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Kids! Kids! Roll your
way to childhood obesity!"

151
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,130  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
Would you help me try to sell these?

152
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,172  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. Have you considered
using a girl with huge knockers?

153
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,737  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's not what they're looking for.

154
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,374  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, that would work on me.

155
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,496  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:523
Why do you think I buy
Mrs. Butterworth's?

156
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,975  X1:084 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:523
You'll never guess what just happened.

157
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,700  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Phoebe and I got mugged!
-Are you okay?

158
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,368  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.

159
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,539  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
How do you know a mugger?

160
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,813  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm sorry, I have friends
outside the six of us.

161
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,972  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Know how she knew him?
Because Phoebe used to mug people.

162
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,818  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
Seriously?

163
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,370  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I'm not proud of it,
but, you know...

164
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,534  X1:098 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
...when I was living on the street and
I needed money for food and stuff....

165
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,449  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
-That is awful.
-I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?

166
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,533  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:523
I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.

167
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,699  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
I had a hard life.
My mother was killed by a drug dealer.

168
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,451  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Your mother killed herself.
-She was a drug dealer.

169
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,015  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
It was a good thing she knew him.
I was about to do some serious damage.

170
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,539  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

171
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,018  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
This must have brought back
some bad memories for you, Ross.

172
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,893  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Why?
-Ross was mugged as a kid.

173
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,217  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You were?
-Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.

174
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,450  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:486 Y2:523
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.

175
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,410  X1:079 X2:641 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was minding my business, seeing what
kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.

176
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,576  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wonder Woman.

177
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,736  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:523
Anyway, I was heading
towards this bakery...

178
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,371  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
...to pick up a couple of dozen
linzer tortes for someone...

179
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,410  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
...when out of nowhere, this thug
with a pipe jumps out and says:

180
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,775  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
-"Give me your money, punk!"
-Oh, my God.

181
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,693  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know. And the worst part
was, they took my backpack...

182
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,457  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:444 Y2:523
...which had all the original artwork I did
for my own comic book, Science Boy.

183
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,693  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, yeah! What was
his super power again?

184
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,653  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:523
A super-human thirst for knowledge.

185
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,259  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
I better get to class.

186
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,492  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
Are there any more of your
friends I should look out for?

187
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,658  X1:100 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
No. Actually, you might want to stay
away from Jane Street.

188
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,369  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's where Stabby Joe works.

189
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,939  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I think we have a problem here.
-What?

190
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,055  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:523
Back in my mugging days,
I worked St. Mark's Comics.

191
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,577  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah?
-A pipe was my weapon of choice...

192
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,777  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and preteen, comic-book nerds
were my meat.

193
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,489  X1:320 X2:398 Y1:488 Y2:523
So?

194
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,010  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
There was one kid who had
a sticker on his backpack that said:

195
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,336  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:442 Y2:523
-"Geology rocks!"
-"Geology rocks!"

196
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,094  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, my God!
-I know! I mugged Ross!

197
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,011  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:442 Y2:523
-You're late.
-I know. I'm sorry.

198
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,852  X1:113 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
But can I just run to the bathroom?

199
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,894  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:442 Y2:523
-No. Leonard doesn't wait.
-But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!

200
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,608  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, here we go!
Let's go. Very quickly.

201
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,095  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I really need--
-We must go now, quickly.

202
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,212  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Yeah. Yes, sir.
-Ready?

203
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,769  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What the hell are you still doing here?
-I think you know!

204
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,329  X1:089 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, you sick bastard!
-I am what you made me! Know what?

205
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,139  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What?
-I could go right now.

206
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,857  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Then go. Go!
-Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!

207
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,014  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
Cut. That was good!

208
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,570  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Very good. You did everything I asked.
-I did?

209
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,176  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yes. Plus which, you've got this,
I don't know, this squirmy quality...

210
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,220  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
...you bring to the character
I couldn't have imagined.

211
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,853  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here's what we're gonna do:

212
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,454  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:523
Come back tomorrow
for the final callbacks.

213
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,612  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do all of this, what you got
going now. But you know what?

214
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,293  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
More. More. Can you do that?

215
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,612  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:442 Y2:523
Sure. I don't have time to say
thank you because I really gotta go!

216
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,808  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:523
Look at that! Still in character.
I like him.

217
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,576  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
I plant seeds. I can't explain it.
I don't know.

218
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,293  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Putting on the sneakers...

219
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,060  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
...to get in the young mindset,
see if it sparks anything.

220
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,854  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:446 Y2:523
-Oh, anything yet?
-Yes, how's this?

221
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,855  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:442 Y2:523
"They're so uncomfortable, it's like
getting kicked in the nuts for your feet."

222
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,408  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing.

223
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,133  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, that seems about right.

224
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,730  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.
Apparently, that makes me a good actor.

225
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,778  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
I got a callback, so I'm drinking
everything. Oh, by the way...

226
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,170  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
...that eggnog in our fridge was great!

227
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,737  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Joey, that was formula.
-We gotta get more of that.

228
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,772  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:442 Y2:523
These aren't half bad. You should
suggest these to Ralph Lauren.

229
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,895  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.

230
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,135  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right. I feel younger already.

231
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,136  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, I think I broke my hip.

232
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,893  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hey, you!
-Hey.

233
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,534  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey. How was class?

234
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,336  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
No one asks me that. What's wrong?

235
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,372  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Nothing. I really want to know.
-Oh.

236
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,738  X1:092 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, there was actually a rather lively
discussion about the Pleistocene--

237
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,329  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, nothing is worth this.

238
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,094  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:488 Y2:523
I have a confession to make.

239
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,172  X1:116 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, you know that girl that
mugged you when you were a kid?

240
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,813  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
What are you talking about?
It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.

241
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,330  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:442 Y2:523
You don't have to lie anymore.
I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.

242
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,019  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:446 Y2:523
-No, it wasn't.
-Yes, it was.

243
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,213  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:442 Y2:523
You don't think I would have defended
myself against a 14-year-old--?

244
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,969  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:442 Y2:523
-"Give me your money, punk!"
-Oh, my God, it was you!

245
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,214  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't believe it. You mugged me?

246
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,296  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,099  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:523
But, you know, if you think
about it, it's kind of neat.

248
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,699  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, well, it's just that I've
always felt kind of like an outsider.

249
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,250  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, the rest of you have
connections that go way back...

250
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,857  X1:167 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and, you know, now you
and I have a great one.

251
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,692  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's not the best!

252
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,811  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know. Please forgive me.
I don't know what to say.

253
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,569  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:442 Y2:523
There's nothing you can say! That was
the most humiliating thing ever.

254
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,852  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Even more humiliating than--
-Let's not do this!

255
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,415  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:444 Y2:523
And then, at the end of the commercial,
the girls get out of the hot tub...

256
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,935  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and start making
out with each other.

257
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,335  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's interesting.

258
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,216  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:523
Just one thought: You didn't
mention the shoes.

259
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,133  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:486 Y2:523
Who's next? Chandler.

260
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,009  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:523
You start with a guy
putting on the shoes.

261
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,136  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:442 Y2:523
-He's about my age.
-Your age?

262
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,492  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
He's rolling down the street
and he starts to lose control.

263
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,094  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe he falls.
Maybe he hurts himself.

264
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,809  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just then, a kid comes flying
by wearing the shoes.

265
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,450  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:523
He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
And the line reads:

266
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,214  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:486 Y2:523
"Not suitable for adults."

267
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,848  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Well, Chandler, that's great.
-Thank you, sir.

268
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,535  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:442 Y2:523
Or, man who's two
years younger than me.

269
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,736  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
You see, that has a clear selling point.
It appeals to our key demographic.

270
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,778  X1:124 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:523
-How did you come up with that?
-I don't know! I don't know!

271
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,412  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:523
I was just trying to get into a young
mindset, and stuff started to flow.

272
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,058  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
-That is great. Good work.
-Thank you.

273
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,820  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
We'll see all of you tomorrow.

274
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,090  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
The cold weather hurts my hip.

275
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:45,209  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad at
me, but can I just talk to you for a sec?

276
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,857  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
Sure, go ahead.

277
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,052  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just really wanted to apologize again.

278
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,850  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:054 Y2:133
And also show you something
I think you'll find very exciting.

279
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,254  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God! "Crap from the street!"

280
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,728  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:486 Y2:523
Look, Ross. In this box...

281
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,291  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
...are all the things I got from mugging
that I thought were too special to sell...

282
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,337  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:488 Y2:523
...or smoke.

283
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,698  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
Anyway, I was looking
through it, and I found...

284
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,058  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:054 Y2:094
...Science Boy.

285
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,611  X1:256 X2:451 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

286
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,979  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
I never thought I'd see this again.

287
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,373  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's all here!

288
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,893  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:523
What made you save
it all these years?

289
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,455  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
I guess I just thought
it was really good.

290
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,895  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
And maybe it would be
worth something one day.

291
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,056  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
You really thought Science Boy
was worth saving?

292
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,129  X1:075 X2:643 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. But you should know I also have a
jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.

293
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,618  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:523
Still, this is amazing!

294
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,657  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.

295
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,092  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're welcome. Thank you for
Science Boy. I learned a lot from him.

296
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,093  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:486 Y2:523
You're welcome.

297
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,250  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I need an answer!
-I can't tell you something I don't know.

298
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,217  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:523
-You know!
-I don't know!

299
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,097  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:523
-I need an answer now!
-You want an answer? The answer is....

300
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,975  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
She never loved me.
She only loved you.

301
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,774  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
You knew this all along
and you never told me?

302
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,809  X1:074 X2:646 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can never forgive you, or myself. I have
nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!

303
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,890  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
Absolutely amazing.

304
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,939  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
-The part is yours.
-Thanks! Now I really gotta go.

305
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,894  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, wait! Congratulations!
You did it.

306
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,097  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:488 Y2:523
