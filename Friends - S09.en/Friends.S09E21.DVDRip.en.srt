1
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:07,768  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's so weird. How did Joey
end up kissing Charlie last night?

2
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:11,926  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
-I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too.

3
00:00:12,093 --> 00:00:13,845  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:523
But surprise!

4
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:17,408  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
I missed most of the party.

5
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:18,926  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
Charlie's a girl, right?

6
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:24,245  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah, she's this new professor
in my department that I did not kiss.

7
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:28,971  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her.
Of all the girls at the party, God!

8
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:34,212  X1:075 X2:645 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Why do you care so much?
-Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?

9
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:41,843  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because Ross is the father of my child.

10
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:46,052  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know, and I want him
to hook up with lots of women.

11
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:51,129  X1:081 X2:638 Y1:442 Y2:523
All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joey
and Charlie have anything in common.

12
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:55,286  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:448 Y2:523
I don't know. They seemed to have
a shared interest in each other's tonsils.

13
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:59,965  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wow. Joey and a professor.
Can you imagine if they had kids?

14
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,488  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
And if the kids got her intelligence...

15
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:05,531  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...

16
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:08,002  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
...those nerds would get laid!

17
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:13,089  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:442 Y2:523
All right. So, Ross, you're
okay with all this? I mean....

18
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:16,211  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's no big deal.
I just met her. I'm fine with it.

19
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:21,687  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
God, I forgot how hot she was.

20
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:24,563  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

21
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,566  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Oh, you know, I'll come with you.
-Okay.

22
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:32,805  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:523
-So a professor, huh?
-Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.

23
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,726  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Her mind is totally acrimonious.

24
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,607  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:486 Y2:523
Guess that's not how she used it.

25
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:47,842  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

26
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:51,847  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't ordinarily go around
kissing guys at parties.

27
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:53,412  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm....

28
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:57,812  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:442 Y2:523
Well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really
hope you don't think less of me.

29
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:00,407  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
Think less of you? No.
I don't think less of you.

30
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:03,292  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
I mean, you saw someone you liked
and you kissed them.

31
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:06,684  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:523
Those people who like someone
and don't kiss them...

32
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:10,528  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
...those people are stupid.
I hate those people.

33
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,924  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:442 Y2:523
Actually, I'm a little surprised
at myself.

34
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:16,165  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, Joey's so different
from the guys I usually date.

35
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,370  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
They're all professors, intellectuals.
Paleontologists mostly.

36
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,366  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You know, very cerebral--
-Yeah, I know the type.

37
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:27,005  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
If we want to grab a bite before work,
we'd better get acrimonious.

38
00:02:29,213 --> 00:02:32,046  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
No?
Am I getting close?

39
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:35,329  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
The One With The Fertility Test

40
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:23,242  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:054 Y2:128
-Hey!
-Hi.

41
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,768  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:054 Y2:133
Hey, you guys.
Look what I just got.

42
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,125  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, wow! I love those!
Where did you get them?

43
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:35,003  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:054 Y2:133
I bought them off eBay. They used
to belong to the late Shania Twain.

44
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:40,202  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:054 Y2:091
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.

45
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,885  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, then I overpaid.

46
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,682  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:054 Y2:095
Hey, what's this?

47
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,845  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:054 Y2:134
Oh, it's a gift certificate
to this new spa in SoHo.

48
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:53,688  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:054 Y2:134
You can't show Phoebe this. She hates
those corporate massage chains.

49
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:56,289  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:054 Y2:095
What, now I can't get a massage?

50
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,684  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:054 Y2:133
There are so many things
that she disapproves of.

51
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,845  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:054 Y2:090
I can't eat veal. I can't wear fur.

52
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:05,322  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't go hunting.

53
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:09,603  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Do you want to go hunting?
-I would like to have the option.

54
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:14,207  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:054 Y2:095
What's that? Hey, Rachel?

55
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,091  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:054 Y2:095
No, you can't go there!

56
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,767  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:054 Y2:133
You know how I feel about
these big massage places.

57
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,288  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:054 Y2:129
They're putting people like me
out of business.

58
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:23,648  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
She wants to go hunting too!

59
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,169  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:054 Y2:128
Phoebe, come on,
I don't want to waste it.

60
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,449  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
It would be like throwing
away 100 bucks.

61
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:34,491  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:054 Y2:133
Okay, this is not about
the money. Okay?

62
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:37,725  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:442 Y2:523
It's about corporate greed
destroying our hearts...

63
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:40,930  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and leaving us hollow shells.

64
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:44,727  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't care about any of that.

65
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:51,130  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, do you care about friendship?
I feel really strongly about this.

66
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,882  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:442 Y2:523
Please don't use this gift certificate.
I'm asking you as a friend.

67
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,972  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!

68
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:01,041  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:486 Y2:523
Fine. I won't use it.

69
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,090  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Promise?
-I promise.

70
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:06,689  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Thank you.
-Well, I am going hunting.

71
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,602  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, honey. I missed you today.

72
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,162  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Hey.

73
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:22,523  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
-What do you wanna do tonight?
-Oh, well, maybe we could....

74
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:35,129  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, trying to turn me on
by making a mess?

75
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,806  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:523
Know your audience.

76
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,564  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:442 Y2:523
Besides, tomorrow we're doing
those fertility tests.

77
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,611  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
Until then, you need to keep
your tadpoles in the tank.

78
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,049  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do we really need to take those tests?

79
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:50,204  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:442 Y2:523
We've been trying
to have a baby for a year.

80
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:53,171  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:442 Y2:523
I think it's a good idea
to find out if everything's okay.

81
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,212  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Just a few routine tests.
-But I don't want to do it in a cup.

82
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:01,686  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:523
-What is the big deal?
-It's weird! You're in a doctor's office.

83
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:04,083  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's not okay to do it
in a doctor's office...

84
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:07,529  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but it is okay to do it in
a parked car behind a Taco Bell?

85
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:13,763  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
I cannot believe Ross told you that.

86
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:18,121  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.

87
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,921  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:523
Look, I don't want to do
these tests either.

88
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:23,323  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:444 Y2:523
But I really do think
it's a good idea.

89
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:25,768  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm sure a doctor's office
can't be worse...

90
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:29,050  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
...than on a class trip
to the Hershey factory.

91
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,922  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!

92
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,970  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:523
Who says wine has to cost
more than milk?

93
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:48,642  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Hey!
-Hi.

94
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,969  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Come on in. How are you?
-I'm good.

95
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,727  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Can I offer you a drink?
-Please.

96
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,088  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have been crazed all day.

97
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:59,245  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
I had a meeting with the dean,
my syllabus for summer school's due...

98
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,449  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and I'm writing the foreword
for a book.

99
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:06,004  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
I had a pretty hectic day at work too.
Today I had to open a door and go:

100
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,210  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
So I am just so excited to be here.

101
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,490  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I can't wait to explore the city.
-If you need a tour guide....

102
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,962  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, you mean it?
That would be so fun.

103
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:20,012  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.
What do you want to see first?

104
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,166  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
We could go see the Kronos Quartet
at Avery Fisher Hall.

105
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,807  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

106
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:32,807  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:442 Y2:523
There's a collection of Walt Whitman
letters on display at the public library.

107
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,850  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know.

108
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:40,286  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
-But first, I have to see the Met.
-Okay, let me stop you right there.

109
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:43,286  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
The Mets suck, okay?

110
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,442  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
You wanna see the Yankees.

111
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:50,207  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
No. No, not the Mets.
The Met. Singular.

112
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:52,682  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
Which one? They all suck.

113
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:54,926  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
The museum.

114
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:58,569  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't think so.

115
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:07,324  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Hi there.
-Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.

116
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:09,290  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
How may I help you?

117
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:13,722  X1:122 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hi. I have a massage appointment
under Rachel Green.

118
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:18,489  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay.
-And here is my gift certificate.

119
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:24,649  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
-This has been torn up.
-And taped back together.

120
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:29,209  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:442 Y2:523
Okay. Well, I'll call you as soon
as your massage therapist is ready.

121
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:31,841  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Okay.
-Have a seat through the glass doors.

122
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:36,087  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Through the glass doors.
-Through the glass doors.

123
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:38,566  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:523
Alrighty then.

124
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:48,686  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:442 Y2:523
Phoebe, your next client's
in the waiting room.

125
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:52,129  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do we have to talk like that
when they're not around?

126
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,725  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, no. No, no.

127
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,769  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
Listen, is there someone
who can fill in for me?

128
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,170  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Sorry. Everyone is booked.
-That woman can't know I work here.

129
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,767  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:442 Y2:523
She's a friend of mine
and I made this big stink...

130
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:08,969  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
...about how awful
these massage chains are.

131
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,603  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Then why do you work here?
-Because it's good money.

132
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,691  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
But that doesn't change the fact...

133
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,925  X1:118 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that this is an evil, bloodsucking
corporate machine.

134
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:21,530  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:523
Well, I think this is a great place
to work.

135
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:25,852  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, are they listening?

136
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,051  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Ross. Hey.
-Hi.

137
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:34,205  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
I need to talk to you about Charlie.

138
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:36,768  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, do you? Do you really?

139
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:39,608  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:442 Y2:523
Yeah, I'm kind of having
a little problem.

140
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:44,563  X1:085 X2:634 Y1:442 Y2:523
Look, if you don't know what the word
"acrimonious" means, just don't use it.

141
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:47,005  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look, you know Charlie, right?

142
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:50,961  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:442 Y2:523
-She's cool, funny, her body is so--
-Get to the problem.

143
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:55,411  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:442 Y2:523
Right. She's just so much smarter
than all the girls I've ever dated.

144
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:57,404  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:523
Combined.

145
00:09:57,573 --> 00:10:02,249  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know? And I just--
I don't want her to think I'm stupid.

146
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,448  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you wearing two belts?

147
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:11,163  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, what do you know?

148
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,525  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:442 Y2:523
You were saying you didn't want
to seem stupid.

149
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:22,129  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, she wants to go
to all these cultural places...

150
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:26,366  X1:096 X2:624 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and I don't know how to talk about
that stuff. You gotta help me out.

151
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:29,366  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:442 Y2:523
I don't want to get involved
in your guys' relationship.

152
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:32,525  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, dude, please. Come on,
you're the smartest person I know.

153
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:36,652  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
And I really like this girl, okay?
I don't want to lose her.

154
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,162  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Fine.
-Thanks.

155
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,085  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Let's see.

156
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:46,928  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Oh, you should take her to the Met.
-The Mets.

157
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,887  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no, no. The Met.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

158
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,683  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:523
Oh, that's what she meant.

159
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:59,209  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:442 Y2:523
If they're gonna shorten it, they
should call it the "Muse, " you know?

160
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:02,012  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:523
Short for "museum"
and avoid all the confusion.

161
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:08,925  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, most days the place is packed
with confused, angry baseball fans.

162
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:11,846  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
Okay. All right,
so I'll take her to the Met.

163
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:17,724  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yeah. Okay. There's this great
rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.

164
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:20,249  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know what?
She loves architecture.

165
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,849  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:523
You should take a walk down Fifth
to the St. Patrick's Cathedral.

166
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:27,562  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:442 Y2:523
And there, there's this great
little pastry shop that she'd love.

167
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,247  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
Jeez. Sounds like you
should be going on this date.

168
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:32,485  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:486 Y2:523
But I'm not.

169
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,048  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
-And you know what--?
-Okay, slow down.

170
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:39,364  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:442 Y2:523
You're going way too fast.
Okay? Just go back to the Met.

171
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,127  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:523
So you gotta tell me exactly
what to do there.

172
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:44,682  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
When you walk into the museum,
take a right, okay?

173
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,366  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's the antiquities wing.

174
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,684  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,
up to the Byzantine Empire.

175
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:56,208  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. So I walk in the door
and make a right.

176
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:11,531  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have a weird feeling about
this place. How do I know...

177
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:15,572  X1:111 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
...they won't secretly videotape me
and put it all over the Internet?

178
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,926  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because, honey, and I mean this
in the sweetest way possible...

179
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,448  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:523
...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.

180
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,605  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
Mr. Bing? Here you are.

181
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:29,651  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
Go into that room and deposit
your specimen into the container.

182
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,212  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
Deposit my specimen?

183
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:34,763  X1:114 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:523
I usually have to call a 900 number
for that kind of talk.

184
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,644  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks. Got it.

185
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:43,603  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
All right. Honey, my tests
are down the hall.

186
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:46,845  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
-Yeah, I guess.

187
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,766  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look, I know this is embarrassing,
but nobody cares.

188
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,606  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
No one here even knows you.

189
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,807  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

190
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,127  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, come on!

191
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,849  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
How great is this?

192
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:15,886  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:442 Y2:523
We're probably fertile.
Let's go home.

193
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,966  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why are you here?

194
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,284  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:523
Sid and I are trying again
and we had trouble last time--

195
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:27,128  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no, no. I mean, why?
Why is she here?

196
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:31,805  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:442 Y2:523
Oh, someone's a little cranky today
because they have to do it in a cup.

197
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,441  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.

198
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:39,010  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

199
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:46,005  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:442 Y2:523
This was fun. But I've got
an invasive vaginal exam to get to.

200
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:50,883  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'd love to stay
but I've got a hot date.

201
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:54,966  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Please go. Just let me know
if you need a hand.

202
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:02,647  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think it just fell off.

203
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,969  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hello, ja.

204
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:14,167  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's time for your massage, ja?

205
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,324  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Put your face in the hole.

206
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:21,970  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
A Swedish massage
from a real Swedish person.

207
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,772  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, then I'm Swedish.

208
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:29,088  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, what's your name?

209
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:31,926  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's a normal Swedish name.

210
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:33,685  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ikea.

211
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:38,325  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Wow. What an interesting name.
-Yeah.

212
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:41,565  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You know, l--
-Time for your scalp massage.

213
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:46,331  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow. I really love your--

214
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:52,048  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Is something wrong?
-No, it's just....

215
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:54,204  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
It just feels so good...

216
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:56,091  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
...lkea.

217
00:14:57,093 --> 00:15:01,086  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:442 Y2:523
Hey, say, you'll know this.
What's the capital of Sweden?

218
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:03,892  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stockholm.

219
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,807  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:523
Damn. I wish I knew
if that was right.

220
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:12,561  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
Note the painterly lines
and subtle impasto on this canvas.

221
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:15,367  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
Monet painted quickly,
and usually outdoors...

222
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:19,526  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
...as his elusive subject
was light itself.

223
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:24,763  X1:166 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
Now, do you have any idea
what you just said?

224
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:31,572  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no. My mouth says the words,
my brain is thinking "monster trucks."

225
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:35,929  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
Now, remember,
when you get to the museum...

226
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:39,927  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.
I just--

227
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:44,450  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
-I wrote that out phonetically for you.
-Phonetically?

228
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:48,569  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, that means--
We just don't have time for this.

229
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:53,249  X1:071 X2:645 Y1:442 Y2:523
I gotta say, I'm really impressed you
were able to memorize all this so quickly.

230
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:55,888  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm an actor.
I can memorize anything.

231
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:57,606  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
Last week on Days, I had to say:

232
00:15:57,773 --> 00:16:00,003  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:442 Y2:523
"Frontal temporal
zygomatic craniotomy."

233
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:03,961  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Wow. What does that mean?
-No idea.

234
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:07,364  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:523
But the guy I said it to
dies in the next scene...

235
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,331  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
...so I guess it means,
"You'll get eaten by a bear."

236
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,572  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

237
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,211  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:442 Y2:523
-So let's move on to the Renaissance.
-Okay.

238
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:22,562  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...

239
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,691  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
...to highlight the anguish
of the central figure.

240
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,525  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:523
Touch it. It's really bumpy.

241
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:33,324  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, no, no. No ad-libbing. And, dude,
you can't touch the paintings.

242
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,687  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Come on.
-No. No!

243
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,329  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
My specimen's in the room.

244
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:51,566  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:523
I just want to thank whoever knocked
on the door while I was in there.

245
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,769  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really helped speed the process along.

246
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:59,253  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Janice, you're not gone?

247
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:01,641  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sid is still in his room.

248
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:06,011  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:523
I don't allow porn at home,
so this is like a vacation for him.

249
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:10,046  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?

250
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:14,331  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Yeah. The hard part's over.
-That's not the hard part, honey.

251
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:18,850  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:442 Y2:523
The hard part's what comes next.
Aren't you worried about the results?

252
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:21,408  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:523
I haven't even thought
about the results.

253
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,803  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just assumed everything
would be okay.

254
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:26,168  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:523
Well, you know what? It probably is.

255
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:27,852  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
But what if it's not okay?

256
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,085  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:442 Y2:523
I mean, what if there's a reason
we can't have a baby?

257
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:34,450  X1:134 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:523
Chandler. Look, you and Monica
are meant to have children.

258
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:36,569  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sure it's gonna be just fine.

259
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:43,207  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. I can't
believe I didn't even think of that.

260
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:47,764  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
I guess I was so worried about
having to come here and do that.

261
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,163  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
You can do it
in a Taco Bell parking lot...

262
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,722  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:523
...but you can't do it
at a doctor's office?

263
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,168  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
It was a Wendy's!

264
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:11,049  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:442 Y2:523
And that's the Swedish national anthem.
Thank you for asking.

265
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:14,443  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:486 Y2:523
Wow, lkea.

266
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,368  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
What a rich culture.

267
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:20,206  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know what?
I have a friend who's a masseuse.

268
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:23,922  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
-Oh? Ja, ja?
-Ja. She's not very good, though.

269
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:32,483  X1:141 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:523
-And why do you think that is?
-I don't know.

270
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,725  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:442 Y2:523
Maybe it's because she's got
such callousy fingers...

271
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:38,453  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
...from playing crummy guitar.

272
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:49,562  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
Or maybe she has trouble
loosening your knots...

273
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:53,043  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:442 Y2:523
...because you're such
a high-maintenance tight-ass.

274
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:54,931  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Phoebe!
-You know it's me?

275
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,243  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, for like a half an hour!

276
00:18:57,413 --> 00:19:00,132  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
Man, you can lie about Sweden!

277
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:03,211  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
How can you come here?

278
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:06,763  X1:084 X2:635 Y1:442 Y2:523
-Why didn't you tell me you work here?
-I don't have to tell you everything!

279
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:10,289  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:442 Y2:523
You do if you're gonna make me feel
guilty for getting a free massage.

280
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:12,604  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
Tip's not included.

281
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,283  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why did you lie to me
about working here?

282
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:20,571  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
Because I was ashamed, okay?
I sold out for the cash.

283
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:25,761  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:523
And they give me benefits, like medical
and dental and a four-oh-wunk.

284
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:35,529  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
But, you know, you pay a price.
Now I'm this corporate stooge...

285
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:37,888  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and punching a clock...

286
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,850  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and paying taxes!

287
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:43,491  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
Phoebe, honey,
if you hate it so much...

288
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:47,248  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
...you should walk out there
right now and quit.

289
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,922  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
Be true to what you believe in.

290
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:53,563  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:523
Honey, you have principles,
and I so admire that.

291
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,849  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:523
I don't have any.

292
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,411  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know what? You're right.
I am gonna quit.

293
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:04,168  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:442 Y2:523
-It's time I took my life back.
-Good for you, Pheebs.

294
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:11,923  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you guys have microphones in
there too, I didn't mean any of that.

295
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:14,370  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you.

296
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:21,205  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:448 Y2:523
Got you!
Die! Die! Die!

297
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:26,411  X1:123 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
Respectfully, Professor R. Geller.

298
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,724  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, how was the Met?

299
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:32,884  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
The museum was amazing.

300
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:35,328  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?

301
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:37,563  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:486 Y2:523
Not so much, no.

302
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,327  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
He had clearly memorized
all this stuff to say...

303
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:43,132  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:442 Y2:523
...and some of it didn't
even make any sense.

304
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,565  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:523
-What do you mean?
-Well, for one...

305
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,566  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:523
...he was talking about paintings
that were nowhere around.

306
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:55,610  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait a minute. When you guys walked
into the Met, did you go to the right?

307
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:59,561  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
-No. No, we went to the left.
-Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.

308
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:05,249  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Still, it seems like you guys
are having a great time together.

309
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,612  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:523
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

310
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:11,762  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

311
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:15,290  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually, Joey's your friend...

312
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:17,967  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and you don't know me that well.
It'd be weird.

313
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,887  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:523
Well, I mean, a little.
But no, what? Go on.

314
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:22,042  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well....

315
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:26,603  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:442 Y2:523
I'm thinking that maybe Joey
isn't the right guy for me right now.

316
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:29,845  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:523
You know, maybe I should
be with someone...

317
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:35,408  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:523
...I have more in common with.
You know what I mean?

318
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:38,206  X1:302 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

319
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:43,002  X1:161 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, but you know what?

320
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:47,005  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think you should give Joey a chance.

321
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,925  X1:174 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:523
I mean, he's a great guy.

322
00:21:49,093 --> 00:21:51,561  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:523
And sure, he doesn't know
that much about art...

323
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,327  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:523
...but you can always talk about
that with someone else.

324
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,643  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:442 Y2:523
-I guess that's true.
-If you think about it...

325
00:21:56,853 --> 00:22:00,812  X1:095 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
...he memorized all that stuff because
he thought it was important to you.

326
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:03,567  X1:125 X2:595 Y1:442 Y2:523
You know, that's the kind of guy
Joey is.

327
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:06,167  X1:225 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:523
He is very sweet.

328
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,925  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:486 Y2:523
Plus, he is hot!

329
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:12,569  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
That was gonna be my next argument.

330
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:16,804  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:444 Y2:523
-You ready?
-Yeah. Let's go.

331
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:17,962  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow!

332
00:22:19,653 --> 00:22:21,723  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:448 Y2:523
-Thanks, Ross.
-Yeah.

333
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:26,323  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.
You hooked me up.

334
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:29,281  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
Glad I could help, man.

335
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:33,372  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:446 Y2:523
Some of the stuff wasn't where you said
it would be, but I made it work.

336
00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:47,292  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:442 Y2:523
It is not okay that I'm aroused
by this now.

337
00:22:50,773 --> 00:22:51,762  X1:306 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello?

338
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:55,086  X1:203 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh. Hi, Dr. Connelly.

339
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:57,728  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:523
No. Well, she's not here...

340
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,372  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
...but I can tell her.

341
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:02,172  X1:119 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
Should I be sitting down for this?

342
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,321  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, so, what does that mean?

343
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:26,288  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Okay, thank you.

344
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:28,011  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks.

345
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,452  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, sweetie.

346
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,766  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:523
Dr. Connelly just called.

347
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:40,163  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
With good news?
Of course it's not good news.

348
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,085  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
You said, "Dr. Connelly just called."

349
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:45,165  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:442 Y2:523
If it was good, you'd have said,
"Dr. Connelly just called!"

350
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,403  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:486 Y2:523
So, what is it? Is it...?

351
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:51,452  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Is there a problem? Is there
a problem with me, or with you?

352
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,249  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually, it's both of us.

353
00:23:56,573 --> 00:23:58,052  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

354
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:01,250  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
Apparently, my sperm
have low motility...

355
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:06,089  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and you have
an inhospitable environment.

356
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:15,924  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, what does that mean?

357
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:19,489  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:442 Y2:523
It means that my guys won't
get off their Barcaloungers...

358
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:23,202  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and you have a uterus that is
prepared to kill the ones that do.

359
00:24:25,893 --> 00:24:28,043  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:446 Y2:523
-It means--
-Wait, Chandler.

360
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,852  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:523
It means that we can keep trying...

361
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:39,002  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:442 Y2:523
...but there's a good chance
this may never happen for us.

362
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,370  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

363
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:50,005  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

364
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,325  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry too.

365
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:57,172  X1:296 X2:410 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well...

366
00:24:57,693 --> 00:25:00,571  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
...we're gonna figure this out.

367
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:05,165  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know.

368
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,482  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:054 Y2:133
-Good morning, Phoebe.
-Good morning, receptionist.

369
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:28,043  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:054 Y2:129
Here's your schedule for the day.
Your first client is in Room 1 .

370
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:32,282  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:054 Y2:129
"Rachel Green."
Son of a bitch! She came back?

371
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:43,364  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:054 Y2:133
Are you ready
for your Scottish massage?

372
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:45,843  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:054 Y2:094
Put your face in the hole, lassie!

373
