1
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:05,648
You said you'd marry Joey?

2
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:09,084
Okay, you have to realize,
I was exhausted, I was emotional.

3
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:10,891
I would have said yes to anybody.

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:15,092
Like that time
when you and I got married.

5
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:17,809
I'm not helping.

6
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:22,371
So you said yes to him,
and you just had our baby?

7
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:26,407
That is right. And traditionally,
the daddy gives the mommy a present.

8
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:28,609
But I am prepared to let that go.

9
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:33,368
So when I came here to see if you
wanted to maybe start things up again...

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,764
...you were engaged to my best friend?

11
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,292
Well--

12
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:40,045
Really?

13
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:42,727
I thought Chandler
was your best friend.

14
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:46,249
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.
Joey's my-- No!

15
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:51,167
Hey, I'm gonna take off.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

16
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:53,170
Rachel said she'd marry you?

17
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:56,892
This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.

18
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:00,729
The One Where Emma Cries

19
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:52,047
I don't want to be negative. So I'll say
most of the signs you bought are good.

20
00:01:55,013 --> 00:02:00,451
No, they ran out of " It's a Girl! "
But I can fix this one.

21
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,564
See? Huh?

22
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,372
So sexy.

23
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,001
-Honey?
-Yeah?

24
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,364
-Honey, why don't you lie down?
-It's okay.

25
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:21,361
Ross and Rachel will be back soon,
and then I gotta go to the office.

26
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,090
Am I producing them?

27
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:30,921
-Why are you so tired?
-I couldn't sleep last night.

28
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:33,971
I started worrying about this big
divisional meeting I have today.

29
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:36,403
The more I worried,
the more I couldn't sleep.

30
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,327
You know, and then I was, like, "If I fall
asleep now, I'll get six hours' sleep.

31
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,565
But if I fall asleep now,
I'll get five hours' sleep."

32
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,928
No matter what I did,
I couldn't fall asleep.

33
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,603
You know what you should've done?
Told yourself that little story.

34
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:53,207
-Hi.
-Hey.

35
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:54,766
-Welcome home.
-Hi.

36
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:56,247
Phoebe did the signs.

37
00:02:57,253 --> 00:03:00,802
You guys, thanks for doing this.

38
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:03,447
Look at all that stuff people sent.

39
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:07,051
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something
every mother needs.

40
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:11,445
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up
the entire apartment.

41
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:16,687
What are people think--?
You guys, I love it.

42
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:19,731
Hey, so where's Ross?

43
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,128
He's downstairs getting the stuff
out of the cab.

44
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,847
-Is he still mad at us?
-Well, you more than me.

45
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,891
But he can't stay too mad at me.
I mean, I just had his baby.

46
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,561
That's not fair. I can't do that.

47
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,328
I'm not sure you should be here
when he comes up.

48
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:37,446
I didn't think I should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.

49
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:40,121
Hey, what do I know?
I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

50
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:49,688
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
New York and London are solid.

51
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:54,324
But many of our field offices
have reported disappointing yields.

52
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,293
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.

53
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:05,126
I could go on and on.
But instead of boring you...

54
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:09,127
...I'll go straight to my 42-point plan.

55
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:20,209
Walter.

56
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,888
She's just so cute.

57
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:28,445
I just want to bite her ear off
and use it as a sucking candy.

58
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:30,932
Phoebe.

59
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:35,211
But I could take one of those little feet
and put it in a pita pocket.

60
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:39,403
-Okay. I put most of the stuff away.
-Oh, great. The pacifiers?

61
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:42,326
-It's in the cupboard.
-The burping cloths?

62
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:45,366
-Linen closet.
-The diapers?

63
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:46,926
In the hospital.

64
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:53,283
-Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy.
-No, I left the diapers at the hospital.

65
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:56,092
There's some in the bag,
but I'll run out and get some more.

66
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,402
All right, thanks.

67
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,763
Could you stop at the coffeehouse
and get me a muffin?

68
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:03,204
-Sure. What kind?
-Let me think.

69
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:06,012
What do I want?

70
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,641
What do I want?

71
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:11,651
Please, take your time.
It's an important decision, not like...

72
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:16,603
...say, I don't know, deciding to marry
someone. This is about a muffin.

73
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:20,844
-Blueberry.
-Blueberry it is.

74
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,288
Thank you.

75
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,930
Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?

76
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,328
God, how long do you think
that's gonna last?

77
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:32,970
I don't know. He got over the
"We were on a break" thing quickly.

78
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,842
You know what,
I can't worry about it right now.

79
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:39,244
Because I've got the cutie little baby.

80
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:44,246
I can't believe how much I love her.
I mean, I can't get enough of her.

81
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:46,802
Like, right now? I miss her.
I actually miss her.

82
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:49,888
You know, that's her?

83
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:56,731
God, look at her sleeping.
I love her so much.

84
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,844
-I think I'm gonna wake her up.
-Rach, no.

85
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:01,811
You know, you're never
supposed to wake a sleeping baby.

86
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:04,322
Well, I can do whatever I want.
I made her.

87
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:11,365
Come on, little girl.
Yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.

88
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:19,052
Well, I would say I told you so,
but she's kind of doing that for me.

89
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,805
I'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry.
Go back to sleep.

90
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:24,770
Go back to sleep.

91
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:29,332
-It breaks your heart, doesn't it?
-It really does.

92
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:32,606
How long do you think
we have to stay?

93
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,688
Okay, if everyone's on board,
it's settled.

94
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:39,287
Chandler?

95
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:45,968
-Chandler?
-Yeah.

96
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,488
Are you on board?

97
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,203
Yes.

98
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,763
Well, then problem solved.
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.

99
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:57,362
You're gonna love Oklahoma.

100
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:04,522
All right. We already tried feeding her,
changing her, burping her....

101
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:08,646
Try this one. "Go back in time
and listen to Phoebe."

102
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,405
-All right, here's something.
-What?

103
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:14,882
It says to try holding the baby
close to your body...

104
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:17,851
...and then swing her rapidly
from side to side.

105
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:21,849
Okay.

106
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,521
It worked!

107
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:34,491
No. Just stopped to throw up
a little bit.

108
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:37,412
Mon, what am I gonna do?

109
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:41,043
It's been hours,
and it won't stop crying.

110
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:46,325
-She, Rach. Not it. She.
-Yeah. I'm not so sure.

111
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:50,365
-Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.
-Yeah, no kidding.

112
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:54,162
All right, this just proves no good
can come from having sex with Ross!

113
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:02,926
Hey, Gunther. Can I get a couple
of blueberry muffins to go?

114
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,089
-Diapers, huh?
-Yep.

115
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,084
So I guess Rachel had your baby?

116
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:11,322
-Yep. Can you believe it?
-Nope.

117
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,610
I can't even believe
she slept with you in the first place.

118
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,610
You mean, like....

119
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,245
Hey.

120
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:32,972
I know you're pissed at me,
but we have to talk about this.

121
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,926
Actually, we don't.

122
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:40,007
Fine. Okay. But I gotta say, technically,
I didn't even do anything wrong.

123
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,525
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

124
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,009
-I said I didn't technically.
-Okay.

125
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:50,608
Let's put aside the fact
that you "accidentally" ...

126
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:55,164
...picked up my grandmother's ring and
you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.

127
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,164
Can I just stop you there
for a second?

128
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:58,726
When people do this:

129
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,248
I don't really know what that means.

130
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:07,887
You were saying?

131
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:11,642
And I could even understand
that you couldn't tell Rachel.

132
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:15,726
But why couldn't you tell me?
You had all day to, and you didn't.

133
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:19,772
I know. I should've.
"I'm sorry."

134
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:26,811
Not using it right, Joe.

135
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:30,124
"I'm sorry."

136
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:34,372
-I'm gonna go.
-No, come on.

137
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,603
-Ross, we have to get past this.
-Give me the bag.

138
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:39,845
No, I don't know what else to do.
I said I'm sorry, now....

139
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,891
Now you should scream at me
or curse me or hit me.

140
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:46,011
-I'm not gonna hit you.
-You'll feel better. I'll feel better.

141
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:48,687
You know you want to,
I can see it in your eyes.

142
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,087
-I don't.
-A little bit.

143
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:53,050
-No.
-Little bit.

144
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,209
-No.
-A little bit more.

145
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:58,921
-Give me the bag. Give me the bag.
-No, hit me. Hit me.

146
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,124
-Give me the bag. I'm not kidding.
-Hit me.

147
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,210
-No.
-Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!

148
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:18,290
-You ducked!
-I'm sorry! It was a reflex!

149
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,724
-Oh, my God! This really hurts!
-I couldn't help it.

150
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:25,642
When a fist comes at your face,
you duck. Look.

151
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:30,087
What is the matter with you?

152
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:32,249
You were supposed to duck!
Why didn't you?

153
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,330
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.

154
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,811
Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there,
they can check your reflexes.

155
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:57,046
-Try feeding her again.
-I already fed her.

156
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:59,813
I know. That's why I said, "Again!"

157
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,083
You guys,
we can't turn on each other, okay?

158
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:05,403
That's just what she wants.

159
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,851
-Hi.
-Hey.

160
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:09,884
-Can I talk to you outside?
-Just stay here.

161
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:12,408
I'm gonna check her diaper.
Pheebs, you want to come?

162
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,332
I'm kind of part of this.

163
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,763
Actually, it's a husband-and-wife
kind of thing.

164
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,328
I knew I should've married Chandler.

165
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,481
-Okay, what's up?
-Okay.

166
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:29,446
You know we said it would be fun
to move to Paris for a year?

167
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:32,173
And you could study French cooking,
and I could write...

168
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:36,451
...and we could picnic along the Seine,
and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.

169
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,649
-Yeah.
-Okay.

170
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:42,249
You know how people say
that Tulsa...

171
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:45,683
...is the Paris of Oklahoma?

172
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,612
What? Who says that?

173
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:53,173
People who have never been
to Paris?

174
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:57,846
-Well, what's going on?
-We're moving to Tulsa.

175
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:02,723
-Excuse me?
-Okay.

176
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:05,566
Ms. McKenna,
she kind of works above my boss.

177
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,606
She asked me to move to Tulsa and
be president of our office there.

178
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:12,163
And I was sleeping
and apparently said yes.

179
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:15,803
-Tulsa, Oklahoma?
-The Sooner State.

180
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:18,971
Whatever that is.

181
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,370
Chandler, I don't even want to see
the musical Oklahoma.

182
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:25,292
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning, "
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?

183
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:29,771
Are you trying to tell me we're moving
to Oklahoma or that you're gay?

184
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:35,008
All right, not that this matters, but did
they at least offer you a huge raise?

185
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,286
No. But they are going to lease us
a Ford Focus.

186
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,886
-I'll get out of it.
-Thank you.

187
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:46,090
-What is wrong with Emma?
-She misunderstood.

188
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:48,323
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.

189
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:55,253
Ma'am, do you have a minute?

190
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:59,611
I kind of have some bad news.
I don't think I can move to Tulsa.

191
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:04,644
-What?
-It's a funny story, actually.

192
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,564
I kind of fell asleep
in the meeting this morning.

193
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:12,123
So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
I didn't really know what I was saying.

194
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,448
You fell asleep?

195
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:16,213
But only because I was up all night
worried about this meeting.

196
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:17,692
Isn't that funny?

197
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:22,007
Irony. Not a fan? All right.

198
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:25,212
See, here's the thing.

199
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:28,723
I went home and told my wife
about Tulsa, and she won't go.

200
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:32,602
See me, I love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.
Tulsa is Italy.

201
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:34,729
Please don't make me go there.

202
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:39,006
-Chandler, l--
-No, look, Carol. Can I call you Carol?

203
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,164
Why would l
when your name is Elaine?

204
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:50,727
What a great picture of your son.
Strapping.

205
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,651
That's a picture of your daughter,
isn't it?

206
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:59,402
Well, she's lovely.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.

207
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,567
I'll call you from Tulsa.

208
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,847
Hey. So how is it?

209
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:14,767
-I broke my thumb.
-Your thumb?

210
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,812
That's weird.
Are you sure you're punching right?

211
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,487
Make a fist.

212
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:25,084
Maybe later.

213
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,925
Ross, I feel terrible.

214
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:31,530
You know what, you can go.
I just have to fill out some forms.

215
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:37,645
You want me to help you with that?

216
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:41,482
Why, does it look like I'm having
trouble with my misshapen claw?

217
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,804
Name?

218
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,886
No, I know Ross.
But what's it short for?

219
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:53,089
You know, like Rossell.

220
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:57,322
Or Rosstrophor.

221
00:14:57,573 --> 00:15:00,007
Just Ross.

222
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,604
It's pretty.

223
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:06,410
-Okay, date of birth?
-You know my birthday.

224
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,643
Sure.

225
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:12,886
May...tember?

226
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:18,247
-October 18.
-Occupation? Dinosaurs.

227
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:25,091
Actually, I'm a paleon--
Dinosaurs is fine.

228
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:28,405
The drawing is not.

229
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:34,644
All right, who do you want
as your emergency contact?

230
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:38,804
-Rachel, I guess.
-Okay. Relationship?

231
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:41,726
Boy, this could take a while.

232
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,849
-Just put roommate.
-Come on.

233
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:50,369
You guys are more than that.
You're gonna get together, right?

234
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:52,450
I don't think that we are.

235
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,563
But you two are supposed
to be together.

236
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:59,845
Well, I thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.

237
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:02,408
Come on, Ross,
that didn't mean anything.

238
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:05,326
She'd just had the baby. She was
freaked out about doing it alone.

239
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:09,372
-She would have said yes to anybody.
-Yeah, that's what she said.

240
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,764
-So?
-So I don't want to be just anybody.

241
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:17,332
-Wow.
-You know what?

242
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,451
It's better this way anyway.

243
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:24,491
I don't know what I was thinking,
going down that road again with us.

244
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:30,091
It's just much easier if we're
just friends who have a kid.

245
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,249
-Really?
-Yeah.

246
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:36,008
-And you're okay with that?
-Yes. That's what we always planned.

247
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,607
And if you have a plan,
you should stick to it.

248
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:42,049
That's why they call them plans.
Hello?

249
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:46,165
I'm fine.

250
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,685
Hey, for what it's worth...

251
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:53,244
...with Rachel, I don't think
you'll ever be just ''anybody.''

252
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:56,604
Hey, there you go.

253
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,689
"Thanks."

254
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:07,963
Oh, my God.
How long has she been crying?

255
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,442
About a week and a half.

256
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:15,084
Well, it looks like you guys got it
under control, so I'm just gonna go.

257
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,410
No? Really?
Misery really does love company?

258
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,689
All right.

259
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:26,003
-Try holding her a different way.
-Look, I'm doing the best I can.

260
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:29,210
-Anyone else is welcome to try.
-All right, I'll try. Fine.

261
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:31,603
-Yes. Okay. Okay.
-Here you go.

262
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:34,367
Hey. Oh, gosh.

263
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,570
Nothing works with this child!

264
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:41,487
God, what am I gonna do, you guys?
I can't even comfort my own baby.

265
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:44,247
-I'm the worst mother ever.
-No, you're just new at this.

266
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:47,530
You'll get better. Think about
your first day at work.

267
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,082
That couldn't have been easy,
but you figured that out.

268
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:54,809
Yeah, I don't think dressing
provocatively is going to help me here!

269
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:58,483
-God, just please take her.
-Okay, I'll take her. Come on.

270
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:01,486
Oh, boy,
I have to go to the bathroom.

271
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,611
I have to go scream into a pillow.

272
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:12,012
Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.

273
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:16,803
Oh, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby.

274
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:20,170
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

275
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,373
Have I gone deaf?

276
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:31,964
It worked. Oh, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

277
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:34,687
You must be a fireball in bed!

278
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:41,885
I can't believe it. She's asleep.
I got her to go to sleep.

279
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,362
I have actual magical powers.

280
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:48,642
I can hear traffic and birds.

281
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:51,327
I can hear the voices in my head
again.

282
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,323
I'm kidding.

283
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,728
Oh, my God!
You got her to stop crying!

284
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,892
Yes, I did. I'm Monica, super aunt.

285
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:10,810
-You are the official baby-crier stopper.
-Yes, I am.

286
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:14,369
-You're never leaving the apartment.
-Say what?

287
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:18,731
That's your new job, day or night.
She starts crying, I need you here.

288
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:22,482
-No, no, no.
-Thankfully, you don't need me at all.

289
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:26,612
So okay. Hey, super aunt?
See you later.

290
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:30,209
Rachel?
Let's give it six to eight months.

291
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:41,367
Okay, so listen,
I'm gonna go lay down.

292
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:43,242
What?

293
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:46,251
The book says whenever
she's sleeping, I should be sleeping.

294
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:47,766
So....

295
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:50,892
Thank you.

296
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,930
Hey.

297
00:19:56,093 --> 00:20:00,132
-We just got her to go to sleep.
-So there can't be any yelling?

298
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,124
No.

299
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:09,770
-We're moving to Tulsa.
-What?

300
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:15,930
I can't-- I can't hear.

301
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:25,092
-Hey.
-Hey. Where have you been?

302
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:30,369
-What happened to you?
-I had a little thing with Joey.

303
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:32,723
lf you think this is bad,
you should see him.

304
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:36,403
No, Ross, this is not good.

305
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:40,851
We have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit.

306
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:47,328
All right, you have got to get over
this Joey thing.

307
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:52,642
Okay? I never really wanted
to marry Joey, okay?

308
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,522
Okay.

309
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:59,813
You know what I really, really want?

310
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,208
What, Rach?

311
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:07,327
I wanna sleep.

312
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:13,487
I wanna eat.
I wanna take a shower.

313
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:17,686
I mean, before she wakes up,
and we gotta do this all over again.

314
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:21,004
-Right.
-I mean, because I got news for you.

315
00:21:21,173 --> 00:21:24,210
Emma: not easy.

316
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:28,648
Well, that's what I'm here for.

317
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:34,805
-You want me to get that?
-No, that's really okay.

318
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:39,364
-Monica?
-Got it, got it, got it, got it.

319
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:52,248
I've been thinking about this.
And I gotta tell you, it's not my fauIt.

320
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:54,927
-It's a natural instinct.
-What are you talking about?

321
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,886
Okay, what would you do if I did this?

322
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:11,002
