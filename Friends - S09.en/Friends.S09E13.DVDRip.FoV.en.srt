1
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:05,901
-Hey.
-Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.

2
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:08,863
Look, can we talk
about what happened here last night?

3
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:12,660
Sure. Just give me a second
to get all huffy and weird like you.

4
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:18,418
You believe that whoever did something
last night did what they did or didn't do?

5
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,579
Okay, you really don't know
what I'm talking about?

6
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:24,140
-No.
-Okay. Last night, after the party...

7
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:27,741
...I saw Rachel kissing that jerk
from her office out on your balcony.

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,298
Our balcony? Seriously?

9
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:32,696
That's so funny. I told Monica
we should put lights on our balcony...

10
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,380
...and she said, "No, no. It's too cold.
Nobody will go out there." And I said:

11
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:38,900
"Maybe if we put some lights
out there they will."

12
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:44,700
Right, that's what I came over to talk
about. I saw Rachel kissing some guy...

13
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:48,460
...on your balcony,
even though there were no lights!

14
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,219
So are you gonna talk to her?

15
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:56,100
Why? Why should I? I mean,
if she wants to move on, that's fine.

16
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:59,741
You know when "that's fine" sounds
true? When someone yells it and spits.

17
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:04,981
No, I'm serious. I mean, if she wants
to date people, fine. I don't care.

18
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:07,215
But at least she could have told me.

19
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:10,741
You know, I've been putting my life on
hold and concentrating on Emma.

20
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:16,338
But if she wants to go out there kissing
guys she barely knows, then so will I.

21
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:21,414
Very funny! Ross is gay!

22
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,657
No, no.
Good, so you're moving on.

23
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:27,214
Do you have any idea
where you're moving on to?

24
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:29,222
I've got plenty of opportunities.

25
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:33,697
Just now, there was some woman
at the coffeehouse smiled at me.

26
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:39,178
And then the other day on the subway,
a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.

27
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:43,977
Dude, don't rub my face
in your crazy single life.

28
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:46,775
And there's an anthropologist
at school...

29
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:50,540
...who totally came on to me during
the interdepartmental potluck dinner.

30
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,259
Why did I get married?

31
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:57,016
The One Where Monica Sings

32
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:44,705
Hey, let me ask you guys something.

33
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,583
I'm having new headshots
taken tomorrow.

34
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:49,942
The photographer said she thinks
I should have my eyebrows waxed.

35
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:52,300
Is that weird for a guy?

36
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,575
-Well, it depends.
-On?

37
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:57,504
On how far along he is
in the sex-change process.

38
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:02,893
No, I totally disagree. I think it's fine
for a guy to do something like that.

39
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:04,578
Especially an actor.

40
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,538
I mean, not that you need to.
Your eyebrows are....

41
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:14,258
Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,
you're freaking me out.

42
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:16,660
Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.

43
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,025
Oh, man, now I have to get
those done too?

44
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:24,104
-Wow, talk about high maintenance.
-You dye your hair.

45
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:27,377
-I'm a woman.
-Double standards!

46
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,458
Before I forget, are you coming
to Mike's piano bar tonight?

47
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:35,340
-Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
-But everybody sings. It's so fun.

48
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:39,498
Last time, this adorable old man got up
there, forgot all the words, flipped out...

49
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:43,863
...and everyone booed him off the stage.
It was so funny.

50
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:47,375
Look, I'm not good at singing.

51
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:51,544
Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
You afraid I'm a better singer?

52
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:53,821
You afraid I'm gonna beat you
at singing?

53
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:59,335
Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.

54
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,417
Wow, I must be growing up.

55
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:08,223
Okay, fine. Just please come and
support Mike. You don't have to sing.

56
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:12,384
So I don't have to sing, and I can just sit
there and pass judgment on others?

57
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,735
-While drinking.
-I'm there.

58
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:19,534
Hi, you guys.
Listen, I really need your help.

59
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,100
I think I did something
really stupid.

60
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:25,780
Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something
so beautiful out of it.

61
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:30,978
No, not that.
I kissed Gavin last night.

62
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,220
-My God.
-You kissed him?

63
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,853
Yeah, it was after the party,
we were on the balcony--

64
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:38,262
Wait, wait, wait. I was at home
the whole time. How did I miss that?

65
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:42,424
Well, it was the end of the party. You
were probably ironing wrapping paper.

66
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,738
Oh, yeah.

67
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,142
So how did you end up kissing?

68
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,575
We were all alone
and he was being really nice...

69
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:54,817
-...and he gave me this scarf.
-I thought you hated him.

70
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:57,624
Well, there is a thin line
between love and hate...

71
00:04:57,785 --> 00:05:02,176
...and it turns out that line
is a scarf.

72
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,419
Are you thinking of starting
something up with this guy?

73
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:09,497
I don't know. It's so complicated.
I work with this guy.

74
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:13,055
I have the baby, and I have Ross.
I don't know what to do.

75
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,342
And I have to be at the office
and see Gavin in 10 minutes.

76
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:19,935
Sounds like you need to think
about what you want and talk to Gavin.

77
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:23,893
-And you definitely should talk to Ross.
-Or...

78
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:27,497
...I could call in sick
and not deal with it at all.

79
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:31,338
Wow! Five months maternity leave,
you're back for four days...

80
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:35,623
...kiss a co-worker and call in sick.
They are lucky to have you.

81
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:44,300
-Hi.
-Hi.

82
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:49,061
-I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
-Name?

83
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,937
Chandler Bing.

84
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,704
Okay, very good.

85
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:57,937
Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,
and Sonya will be right with you.

86
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,096
Okay. Thanks.

87
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:46,463
I touched the stuff.

88
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,415
I'll take care of it.

89
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:54,744
Thanks.

90
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:57,863
So do you...?
Do you get a lot of guys in here?

91
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,698
-Oh, absolutely.
-Oh, good.

92
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:04,375
-You looking to meet somebody?
-All right, let's just do this.

93
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:08,059
Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.

94
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,864
First, I want to tweeze
some of the strays, okay?

95
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:14,813
-Now, this may sting just a little bit.
-I have an extremely high threshold--

96
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:18,898
Holy Mother of God!
Oh, my face! My face!

97
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,900
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

98
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:30,296
It's just a bit of shock, that's all.

99
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:34,743
-But I'll be fine. You can go again.
-Okay.

100
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,697
Sorry.

101
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:47,180
Damn it, woman!

102
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:03,221
It's the most eligible man in New York.
How's the moving on going?

103
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,704
Not well. I went on the subway again
and someone did sit on my hand...

104
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:12,653
...but that person was neither female
nor wearing pants.

105
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,813
Maybe you're going about this
the wrong way. I mean, think about it:

106
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:22,263
Single white male, divorced three times,
two illegitimate children.

107
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:26,945
The personal ad writes itself.

108
00:08:27,905 --> 00:08:31,693
You know, that's funny. Yeah.
So do you think you'll ever work again?

109
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,296
What are you doing?
You know I can only dish it out.

110
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:41,337
I can't believe Rachel just moved on
and didn't say anything to me.

111
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,063
Maybe she didn't move on.

112
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:46,695
Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,
one-time birthday thing.

113
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:49,743
No, a month ago, she gave her number
to some guy in a bar.

114
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,936
-Did she go out with him?
-No. When he called...

115
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,538
...I threw the message away.

116
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:57,216
The highroad.

117
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:02,223
All right, you know what? Enough.
Enough talking. I have to get moving.

118
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:07,256
Hey, check out those two blonds
over there. Hey, come with me.

119
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,979
Are you trying to get
everybody divorced?

120
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,895
You don't have to do anything.
It'll just be easier if it's two of us.

121
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:18,217
Like college, remember? First, you
break the ice with some kind of a joke...

122
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:22,298
...so they know you're the funny one. I
swoop in with interesting conversation...

123
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:26,538
...so they'll see that I'm the brilliant,
brooding sexy one.

124
00:09:29,465 --> 00:09:31,740
I thought I got to make the jokes.

125
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:36,502
-Don't you have to be at work?
-Oh, come on.

126
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:43,855
Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.
This is my friend Ross right here.

127
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:45,538
We were wondering...

128
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:49,539
...if you're up for it, we only need
six more people for a human pyramid.

129
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:53,264
Swoop. Swoop.

130
00:09:57,145 --> 00:10:00,774
Hey, I notice
you're reading the paper.

131
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:03,175
Another flood in Europe, huh?

132
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:07,456
Here's a question:

133
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:13,620
Would you rather drown
or be burned alive?

134
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:19,137
-I'm sorry, we're just leaving.
-Okay.

135
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:23,783
We still got it.

136
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,344
-Who is it?
-Gavin. I brought you some soup.

137
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,894
-Why?
-I heard your were sick.

138
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:42,774
Oh, right! Hold on,
let me just clean up in here a little bit.

139
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,101
Hello, Gavin.

140
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:57,856
I missed you at work.
How you feeling?

141
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:01,614
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.

142
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,822
Oh, good. Because I was having
a totally paranoid moment...

143
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:07,101
...where I thought you
called in sick to avoid me.

144
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:10,103
Oh, no, no, no.

145
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:14,742
So I had fun last night.

146
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:17,296
So did I.

147
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:22,021
Exactly how contagious
is this thing you have?

148
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:27,213
Is it a cold from standing on
the balcony, or did a monkey bite you?

149
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:30,498
-It's just a cold.
-Do you have a fever?

150
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:32,860
Let me see.

151
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:39,983
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

152
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:42,534
What's Ross doing to you
in that picture?

153
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:46,300
Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.

154
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,744
He thought it would be funny.

155
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:52,055
-Right. Right.
-Yeah.

156
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:54,136
-Ross.
-Yeah.

157
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:57,977
What's the deal with you guys? I don't
wanna get in the middle of anything.

158
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:02,975
You're not getting in the middle
of anything. Don't worry about Ross.

159
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,460
Hide! That's Ross! Hide!

160
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,220
-Hide! Hide!
-Yeah, but you said not to worry--

161
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:11,058
I lied and I'm not sick either!
Just stay behind the curtain!

162
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,943
-Hi.
-Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.

163
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,858
No. I'm here to take Emma
to your mother's, remember?

164
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:22,578
Right. Yes, yes.

165
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,500
-Don't panic.
-What?

166
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:27,815
There is a man behind your curtain.

167
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:31,455
-I have Mace in my purse.
-No, that's okay! No, no, no.

168
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:36,460
This is my business associate Gavin
being silly. Come out from behind there.

169
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:40,657
Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.

170
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:43,940
It was my idea to stand there.

171
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:48,223
-Hello. I'll just go get Emma.
-Okay.

172
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,461
So...

173
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,254
-...why did I have to hide?
-I thought it was Ross.

174
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,098
I thought there was nothing
going on between you.

175
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,182
There isn't. There totally isn't.

176
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:05,736
You hear keys in the hall and you jump
like a bronco coming out of the chute.

177
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:10,015
I used to be a rodeo clown.

178
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:15,265
All right, look, Gavin...

179
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:21,454
...I guess I felt guilty
that you were here...

180
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,536
...which I shouldn't.

181
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:27,141
You know, Ross and I
are not in a relationship...

182
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:31,662
...but he is the father of my child.
And, you know...

183
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:35,301
...we do live together. And plus,
there's just so much history, you know?

184
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,296
It's just--
I don't know.

185
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:41,424
-I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.
-It's okay.

186
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:45,377
It's probably not my place,
but can I give you a piece of advice?

187
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:48,855
-Yes.
-You should talk to Ross about all this.

188
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:52,220
People keep saying that.

189
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:56,376
I'm sorry, Gavin.

190
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,137
Don't be.

191
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,865
It's just bad timing.

192
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:04,175
So seriously, rodeo clown?

193
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,585
One of the best, ma'am.
One of the best.

194
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:38,380
Oh, she's my girlfriend.
That's not just how we do it here.

195
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,014
I'm gonna take a little break,
and when we come back...

196
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:44,416
...we've got Kenneth singing
"I Touch Myself."

197
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:47,625
I'm not here to judge.

198
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:54,017
-You have got to sing.
-No, I told you I can't.

199
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:57,535
But you would have so much fun.
And you have a really nice voice.

200
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:01,143
-When have you heard me sing?
-All the time, when you're cooking.

201
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:02,858
-What?
-Yeah, you're always singing:

202
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,698
Yummy, yummy, yummy
I've got love in my tummy

203
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:08,577
Yeah, I do rock that one.

204
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:13,742
Isn't there just a little part of you
that wants to get up there?

205
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:17,816
Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.

206
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,896
I don't even know what I would sing.

207
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:22,665
-Well, I've got a book around--
-"Delta Dawn."

208
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:36,059
Hi. I couldn't help but notice,
but that's an unusual necklace.

209
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:38,978
You already hit on me an hour ago.

210
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:44,100
Right. So that's a firm no?

211
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:52,543
I don't believe this.
I just keep striking out.

212
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:55,054
I don't get it either.

213
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:57,819
I mean, you're obviously desperate.

214
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:01,660
You're asking women
how they wanna be killed.

215
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:04,817
This is great.
Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys...

216
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:08,694
...until she finds the one she wants,
and I'm gonna die alone.

217
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:11,738
By drowning or...?

218
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:17,144
-Why would he break up with me?
-I don't know, sweetie.

219
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:21,423
All I ever wanted was to just love him
and have him love me back.

220
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:25,180
I mean, am I so unlovable?

221
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:28,337
-Wow.
-I know.

222
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:40,705
All right. That was Kenneth with his...

223
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:44,494
...much too literal rendition
of "I Touch Myself."

224
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:48,704
Coming up next, we've got Monica
singing "Delta Dawn."

225
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:51,654
Wait. I can't sing in
front of all these people.

226
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,140
Just pretend they're not
even here. It's okay.

227
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,776
Once that spotlight hits you, it's so
bright, you won't see anyone anyway.

228
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:05,776
Hi, I'm Monica. And I'm going
to be singing "Delta Dawn."

229
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:33,263
-Can you totally see through her shirt?
-Like an x-ray.

230
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:37,017
Bad day not to wear a bra.

231
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:51,334
I need your help.

232
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,296
Wow, it seems serious.

233
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:58,897
What seems to be the problem,
Ashley Judd?

234
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:02,899
I'm getting new headshots taken.
So I went to get my eyebrows shaped.

235
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,903
I'm sorry.
Moment to make fun of that, please.

236
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,544
I may be a sissy, but I'll still
pound you into the ground.

237
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:14,420
Look, it hurt so bad, I could only
let her do one eyebrow, and now...

238
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:17,224
...they don't match!

239
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:32,974
It's like a baby caterpillar
chasing its mama.

240
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,182
You got to help me out, okay?
Look, I have a magic marker.

241
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:39,178
Fill in the skinny one
so I don't look stupid for my pictures.

242
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,853
Okay, first of all, this is green.

243
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,978
-What the hell am I supposed to do?!
-I will help you out...

244
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:49,582
...but you have to promise you won't
tell anyone what I'm about to tell you.

245
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,259
What? What?

246
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:53,859
Okay.

247
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,017
You know how most kids get their
allowance from mowing the lawn...

248
00:18:57,185 --> 00:19:01,576
...or taking out the garbage?
Well, I earned mine...

249
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:07,456
...by plucking the eyebrows of my father
and his "business partners."

250
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:13,617
Oh, my God.

251
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:17,222
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need
my help, VictorVictoria.

252
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:20,337
No, no, no. I do. I do.
I need your help.

253
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:24,015
But, Chandler, I don't know if I can take
any more plucking. It hurt so bad.

254
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:28,776
Not with my combination of ice cubes,
aloe vera and my gentle...

255
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:32,335
...self-loathing touch.

256
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:49,904
I'm sorry, the song's over.

257
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:55,222
-Did you see me up there?
-Every little bit of you.

258
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:59,855
I can't believe I sang
in front of people and they liked me.

259
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,539
Did you hear that guy shouting,
"Look at those tips"?

260
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:06,414
I mean, did I really help
you get a lot of tips?

261
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:07,654
Sure.

262
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:12,741
-Mon, not that you didn't sound good....
-Good?

263
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,221
Didn't you hear them? I was great!

264
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:20,856
Thank you so much for making me
do this. That is the best gift ever.

265
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:23,704
Also a good gift: underwear.

266
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,819
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

267
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:33,938
Public bathrooms freak me out. I can't
even pee, let alone do anything else.

268
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:37,815
But what's great is, you don't
mind talking about it.

269
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:42,422
It is so amazing that I met you on the
same day that Eric broke up with me...

270
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:46,294
...because it's like, you lose a boyfriend,
and you get a boyfriend.

271
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:53,300
No, don't worry. This is not some
rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.

272
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,619
Good choice, Ross.

273
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,415
Hey. Hi. There you are.

274
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,061
-I've been looking for you everywhere.
-Hello. Well, here I am.

275
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:13,098
My mom is not bringing
the baby back until 9:00.

276
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:17,622
So I was hoping you and I
could have a chance to kind of--

277
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,664
-Somebody here?
-Oh, yeah. That's Michelle.

278
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,862
-Who?
-Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.

279
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:30,542
-You've been seeing someone?
-Yeah, didn't I mention that?

280
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:33,503
I mean, we haven't been
going out too long...

281
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:37,374
...but there's this amazing
connection between us.

282
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:41,174
I mean, in fact just before you came in,
she called me her boyfriend.

283
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:45,224
I thought it was a little too soon,
but also, it felt kind of nice.

284
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,940
What are you taking amoxicillin for?

285
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:59,017
How great is this?
You're already comfortable enough...

286
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,779
...to look through my stuff.

287
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,300
I'm sorry, Michelle,
this is my roommate, Rachel.

288
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:06,496
And I'm also Emma's mother.

289
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,581
-Who's Emma?
-I told you about my daughter.

290
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:13,100
This is your daughter?

291
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:16,453
I could be your new mommy.

292
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,417
And done.

293
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:30,140
Oh, my God.

294
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:33,263
I didn't feel a thing.
Hey, are you still looking for a job?

295
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:36,855
Because you could tweeze circles
around that sadistic bitch at the salon.

296
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:41,297
-Thanks. Wanna see what it looks like?
-Yeah.

297
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:46,016
They totally match.
They look great.

298
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:49,222
They look great. How you doing?

299
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:53,502
Yeah, I think it looks pretty good.
I was a little worried I was...

300
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,304
...uncovering a birthmark
right about there...

301
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:59,423
...but it turned out to be
a little piece of chocolate.

302
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,059
-Chandler, thank you so much.
-No problem.

303
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:05,535
Listen, that was a pretty
girlie hour we just spent.

304
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:08,060
We should do something manly
to make up for it.

305
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,341
Yeah.

306
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:15,740
-Curl my eyelashes.
-Yeah!

307
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:23,455
For my next song, I think I'll sing
something a little more upbeat, all right?

308
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:27,459
How about the Pointer Sisters'
"I'm So Excited"?

309
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,855
And make it bouncy.

310
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:32,858
Well, you can probably take care of that
on your end.

311
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:37,573
I'm sorry I'm late. You'll understand
when you see Joey.

312
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:41,181
Honey, you're just in time.
I'm about to sing another song.

313
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,979
-Really? In front of all these people?
-And they love me.

314
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:48,218
-Oh, my God.
-She gives the people what they want.

315
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,819
All right, watch.

316
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,137
Are those my wife's nipples?

317
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:14,253
Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before.
I wouldn't have let her go up again.

318
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:17,258
I've got to stop this.

319
00:24:29,705 --> 00:24:32,424
Who cares? They still love me.

320
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:39,100
You, touching yourself ! Out!

321
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,661
Wow! She does that a lot.

322
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:51,455
Ross, you didn't tell me
you were a doctor.

323
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:54,657
Wait a minute. You haven't even
told her you are a doctor yet?

324
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:56,702
How long have you known her,
like an hour?

325
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:59,897
Actually, about an hour and a half.

326
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:04,456
I told you it wasn't long, but there's
an amazing connection between us.

327
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,855
You feel that too?

328
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:11,541
-I thought that that was just me.
-Are you kidding?

329
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:15,493
-Do you wanna go away this weekend?
-We'll see.

330
00:25:16,545 --> 00:25:17,978
Ross, what's going on here?

331
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:20,978
Are we just bringing strange women
back to the apartment now?

332
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,579
I don't know. Are we just kissing
guys on balconies?

333
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,575
-How do you know about that?
-Through the magic of sight.

334
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:34,657
-I was here, putting our child to sleep--
-Emma.

335
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,623
When I looked through the window
and saw you kissing a guy...

336
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,696
...you've known for what, a week?

337
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:45,540
God, is that what this is all about?
You bring her up here to get back at me?

338
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:49,101
No, actually, see, I had to pee
because I can't use public bathrooms...

339
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:53,417
-...because of the doody parasites.
-Okay, Michelle, it's time to go.

340
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,224
-Well, call me.
-Okay.

341
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:58,097
Wait, you don't have
my phone number.

342
00:25:58,305 --> 00:26:01,342
You know what?
If it's meant to be, I'll guess it.

343
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:05,015
Bye-bye.

344
00:26:05,705 --> 00:26:07,582
Score.

345
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:10,339
Did you not like her? Because I was
hoping we could come...

346
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:12,461
...to your kissing parties
on the balcony.

347
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:16,055
I can't believe you are making a big deal
about this. It was one kiss!

348
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:18,739
-One guy. One time!
-Oh, really?

349
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,459
-Yeah.
-Oh, really?

350
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:24,857
Oh, yeah.

351
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:27,704
-What about the guy from the bar?
-Who?

352
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:30,897
The guy you gave your number to.

353
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:35,183
-How do you know about that?
-Because he called here looking for you.

354
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:39,304
So don't tell me kissing this guy
from work is a one-time thing.

355
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:42,656
Because you've been out there
in bars and on balconies...

356
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:46,818
...for over a month now. And you
don't even have the courtesy to tell me.

357
00:26:47,665 --> 00:26:50,384
-Why didn't I get that message?
-What?

358
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:54,174
From the guy in the bar?
Why didn't I get that message?

359
00:26:54,385 --> 00:26:57,422
Because I folded it up
and put it in my pants pocket.

360
00:26:57,585 --> 00:27:00,622
Do you not look there?

361
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:03,984
Ross.

362
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,974
I never gave it to you.

363
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,783
Why?

364
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:14,985
-I don't know.
-Oh, God, you know what? I don't....

365
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:17,784
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to decide...

366
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:20,743
...what messages
I should or should not get?!

367
00:27:21,065 --> 00:27:23,738
Who am I? I'm the guy
who's taking care of our baby...

368
00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:27,056
-...while you're at bars meeting guys!
-I cannot believe you.

369
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:31,264
I actually came in here hoping to have
a mature conversation about us.

370
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:33,893
But I can't do that with someone
who hides my messages...

371
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:36,784
...and brings crazy women
back to my apartment!

372
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:41,103
Hey, none of the sane ones
wanted to come back with me!

373
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,583
That's not the point, okay?
The point is...

374
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:50,624
...you are the one who moved on
and didn't tell anyone.

375
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:54,784
Oh, God, Ross,
this is just so messed up.

376
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:58,904
What is wrong with us? When people
hear about our situation, they ask:

377
00:27:59,105 --> 00:28:01,983
"You live together, but you're not
a couple, yet you have a baby?

378
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:06,138
Isn't that weird?" And I say,
"No. It's not, because it works for us."

379
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:08,176
But you know what?
This doesn't work.

380
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:12,304
-In fact, this is the opposite of working.
-Clearly.

381
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,623
And you know...

382
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:19,334
...we said that we would live together
as long as this makes sense...

383
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:23,703
...and maybe this
just doesn't make sense anymore.

384
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,580
Yeah, maybe not.

385
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:31,140
So, what do you wanna do?

386
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:36,903
Hi.

387
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:40,375
Can Emma and I live here for a while?

388
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,860
God.

389
00:28:43,545 --> 00:28:47,254
-Of course.
-Thank you.

390
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:53,984
Your eyebrows look weird.

391
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:21,023
So you'll just touch yourself
for anything, then?

392
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:25,814
